 A New York City family central presents Jimmy Carter. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Thank you. What a night. Check it out. One. Two. Two. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much indeed. I'm Jimmy Carter. I'm one of the biggest faces in British comedy. Literally, I've got one of the biggest faces. Look at the size of that. It's like the moon. Probably affecting your menstrual cycle, just being this close. LAUGHTER I had hassle getting out this evening. I had to organise a babysitter. I don't have children. I've just found the lot cheaper than escorts. LAUGHTER There's pretty much nothing they won't do for $40. LAUGHTER I've little smattering of applause for that. Well done, you. LAUGHTER When I told my mum I wanted to grow up and be a comedian, she said, you can't do both. LAUGHTER I'm from Great Britain, obviously. What makes Britain great is our ability to laugh at ourselves. And when I say ourselves, I mean other people. LAUGHTER And when I say laugh, I mean invade. LAUGHTER LAUGHTER APPLAUSE I met an American woman who told me she thought all Englishmen were repressed and uptight. I was angry. I was upset. LAUGHTER But I managed to hide it. LAUGHTER People asked me, what were you like at school? So I tell them, I was a little black girl. LAUGHTER LAUGHTER CHEERING It's about half of you laughing, half of you thinking, was he? LAUGHTER I saw a homeless guy getting off the bus. I thought, well, how does he know it's he's stopped? LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER APPLAUSE I had an amazing cab driver here in New York City. A cab driver, he was smiling and whistling clearly in a brilliant mood. He said, I love my job. I'm on boss. Nobody tells me what to do. I said, left here. LAUGHTER LAUGHTER You know when you go around to a friend's house for the first time and they say to you, did you find it okay? What do you meant to say? LAUGHTER No, I'm still lost. LAUGHTER I saw a thing in the paper about animal rights protesters being up in arms because guinea pigs were being used in testing. I thought the clue there is in the name. They're not calling them guinea pigs for nothing. That is what they're for. LAUGHTER A little slow but you got there and that's important. Well done. Well done, you. Creationists, the right-wing Christians, creationists believe every word Genesis says, I don't even think Phil Collins is a good drummer. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE What is it about being blind to make sure you want to walk the dog the whole time? LAUGHTER Surely the best thing about getting a face transplant would be turning up at the donor's funeral and going, Ooooooh! LAUGHTER You definitely would, come on. APPLAUSE Does anyone here know what you're meant to do if you're stung by jellyfish? Does anyone know? Pion it is exactly the right answer. Yes, if you get stung by jellyfish you're meant to pee on it. I didn't know this. I went on vacation and everyone told me if you get stung by jellyfish you're meant to pee on it, well I'll tell you this much. It doesn't work as well on shark bites. LAUGHTER The boys family were livid. LAUGHTER Apparently once they've been dead a couple of hours there is very little you can do. No. LAUGHTER A boy genuinely died just to make that joke funny. LAUGHTER Don't cry, it's just a joke. Although it was a joke about pissing on a dead boy. So don't, you know, maybe cry a little bit but don't get carried away. If you were offended by that, good luck with the next one. Do you know what you meant to do if you're attacked by a bear? You meant to play dead. It's exactly the right... If you get attacked by a bear you meant to play dead. Do you know why you meant to play dead? It's to get used to how you're going to be in a minute. APPLAUSE Do you know what you meant to do if you're attacked by a bear? LAUGHTER Piss on a bear. LAUGHTER You think you should piss on a bear for the attack you. You're like a walking advert for natural selection. LAUGHTER If a bear is coming at you, sir... ..and you whip it out... ..Mr Bear is just going to think, oh, an order. LAUGHTER Delicious. LAUGHTER My favourite story of the last year concerned a student. He was walking home late one night. He was drunk. This is his crime. He called a police horse gay. He saw a police officer on the back of a horse. He looked at the horse he went gay. Your horse is gay. Now, if ever there was a victimless crime, surely that's it. Calling a police horse gay for a start, there's nothing in the matter with being gay. Secondly, it's a horse it can't understand. Thirdly, even if by some miracle it could understand, I think a horse would be fairly, you know, okay, with being called gay. Because I think a horse would be fairly sexually self-confident. For a start, it's hung like itself. LAUGHTER But the police officer didn't let it go. Oh, no. He got off the horse and he arrested the young man. He fined him $100 for calling a police horse gay. I wish I'd been his lawyer. I would have got him off. Because in his defence the horse was standing naked on all fours in the middle of the street. LAUGHTER With a uniform man on his back that he's quite gay. LAUGHTER I'm not just a comedian, ladies and gentlemen. I'm also a thinker, a philosopher, if you will. And I'd like to share some thoughts with you. So I thought we might just change the mood a little bit in the theatre. Maybe a little bit of background music. Exactly the sort of thing. I'm going to have a little sit down for this. These are sort of jokes, but they're all kind of ideas as well. I just want to share them with you, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah. Let's just get a bit of atmosphere in the room as well. Maybe a little bit of... You know, imagine we're in a smoky cafe, kind of... Yeah, we may have overdone it on the atmosphere there. I don't know if anyone in this production has noticed I'm not white snake. LAUGHTER Maybe a little bit too much smoke, but still we'll soldier on, shall we? What happens if you spill carpet cleaner? LAUGHTER If an amnesiac or Alzheimer's, would they forget they couldn't remember anything? LAUGHTER I worry about my grandmother. If she's alone in the house and she falls, does she make a sound? LAUGHTER Consider the positive. You're never alone with schizophrenia. LAUGHTER If you're schizophrenic and you're offended by that, you can both... ...f*** off. LAUGHTER I was in the airport. Those treadmills they've got are huge. LAUGHTER I'm not superstitious, but I read about this guy that fell out of the 13th floor window of a building, and he died. Spooky. I've had an idea for a shop selling used artificial limbs. It's called the second hand, second hand store. LAUGHTER A snail can travel over a razor blade without cutting itself. Or to put it another way, sometimes scientists get bored. LAUGHTER What was the best thing before sliced bread? LAUGHTER Bread knife? No, massive sandwiches. LAUGHTER If I owned an optician's store, I'd have them do the shop sign in a blurry font. LAUGHTER Confucius said, how do you know you're a man dreaming you're a butterfly and not a butterfly dreaming you're a man? How do I know I'm not a butterfly? I drove here, you f***. LAUGHTER There's a thin line between neighbourhood watch and becoming a vigilante, and it's a line you cross when you buy a cape. I was asked to describe myself in three words. I said smart, dynamic, intelligent, attentive. LAUGHTER LAUGHTER I saw a headline in the paper, it said, America faces crisis. I thought, what? You're running out of faces? LAUGHTER If you took all the Chinese people in the world and you laid them head to toe around the world, you'd ran about half of them. LAUGHTER So don't do that. A woman came up to me in the street with a clipboard, she said, could you spare a few minutes for cancer research? I said, all right, but we're not going to get much done. LAUGHTER Most people that get cosmetic surgery are disappointed with the results, but they look pleasantly surprised. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE I bought my girlfriend a book called Cheap and Easy Vegetarian Cooking, which is ideal for her because not only is she a vegetarian. LAUGHTER I've got a friend, she's got a theory. She reckons the way to drive a man wild with desire is to nibble on easier lobes for hours and hours. I think it's nuts. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE Do you think strippers get home after a hard day undressing and think, oh, more work? LAUGHTER It's now 25 years since the Chernobyl disaster. Is it just me that surprised still no superheroes? LAUGHTER I was out last week collecting for a sponsored walk and in the end I managed to raise so much money I was able to afford a taxi. LAUGHTER Here's a frightening fact for you. If you took all the money that we in the West spend on food in one week, you could feed the third world for one year. Now, I don't know about you good people, but I can't help feeling. We're being overcharged for our groceries. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE Right, final thought. I had an out of body experience. I was beside myself. Quite enough of that, I think. APPLAUSE Have you ever looked at a check in a restaurant where it says service not included and thought, no, it wasn't, was it? I was staying in a hotel. I came down for breakfast. I said, I'll have a fully cooked American star breakfast pancakes bake in the fall bit. The waiter said, what room are you in? I said, it's the dining room. LAUGHTER Sex is always better in hotels. Have you noticed that ladies' gentlemen? Sex is always better in hotels. Why is that? Is it because it's with a hooker? LAUGHTER My girlfriend is always saying, you never tell me how much you love me. I don't want to upset her. LAUGHTER I don't know if anyone else gets this, but my girlfriend tells me about her day in real time. LAUGHTER I said to my girlfriend, I said, you shouldn't eat before you go swimming. She said, why is that? I said, you look fat. LAUGHTER I'm telling these misogynistic jokes, ladies' gentlemen, but I'm actually a fairly modern man. I've got no problem buying tampons, but apparently they're not a proper present. LAUGHTER Happy birthday, mum. LAUGHTER Said, super on the box. I don't know what you want it. Would you agree, ladies, that men are no good at stopping and asking for directions? Would you agree with that, ladies? No, I agree. I put my hand up like that. Men are no good at stopping and asking for directions. Of course, on the other hand, maybe we wouldn't have to if you could read a f***ing map. LAUGHTER I was chatting to a guy at a party. He said, what does your girlfriend do? I said anything but anal. LAUGHTER I'm joking. She loves it. LAUGHTER Women like to dance with men, because women instinctively know if they dance with a man, they'll be able to tell what he's like in the bedroom. And it is quite a good indicator. I tend to dance for about 30 seconds and have a bit of a cry. LAUGHTER I told my girlfriend my ultimate sexual fantasy was to have two women at the same time, and she agreed. But then she was livid when I told she wasn't either of them. I met a girl when I was single who had a twin, so I asked about the three way. You would, wouldn't you? I asked. She agreed. It was amazing, because if anything, her twin was better looking than her, and an all round great guy. LAUGHTER I'm thinking about getting a tattoo, ladies and gentlemen, I'm thinking about getting a tattoo just there, just above the speedos, just above the banana hammock, saying caution choking hazard. LAUGHTER Ages 18 and up. Make-and-tain nuts. Wetting your bed is embarrassing as a child, but as an adult, wetting a child's bed is mortified. Women think men will pee in the sink of the toilets busy. Do you think they're ladies? Bull-****. We'll pee in the sink of its nearer. On that same subject, I've got a little time-saving tip for the gentleman in the room, little time-saving for you. I don't wash my hands after I've been to the toilet. What I do is I wash my **** in the morning and then I'm good for the day. LAUGHTER So I can see the women are thinking, oh, please, and the men are thinking, why didn't I think about it? I saw a story in the local paper about an 84-year-old man marrying a 93-year-old woman. Is it wrong that I looked at that and thought, past not gonna last? I've got a friend she's being classified by her own doctor. She went to her own doctor. He classified her as being morbidly obese. That's an unnecessarily harsh term, isn't it? morbidly obese. As if she doesn't have enough on her plate. LAUGHTER She told me she had a thyroid problem. I said, what are you taking for that? Pies? LAUGHTER There are 10 million obese children in America today. 10 million obese children. Do you realise if they all jumped up and down at the same time? They might lose a little bit of ****ing weight. Of course, the environment is the big issue these days, isn't it? A carbon footprint is a metaphor for the mark you leave on the earth as you walk through your lives. Of course, I don't have one because I drive everywhere. LAUGHTER And it is twice as bad if you're Christian because you've got Jesus traipsing alongside you. LAUGHTER I fantasise about having sex with a gymnast. Not just but, sorry, that's more information than anyone wanted. I fantasise about having sex with a gymnast. Not just because they're really bendy and flexible and you could do loads of extraordinary positions. But also because I imagine they do a brilliant dismount. LAUGHTER They end up by the side of the bed like that. LAUGHTER And if they bend their knees even just a little bit, you can make them do it again. LAUGHTER I can see there are quite a few couples in. Have you all had the sexual history conversation? The sexual history conversation is the conversation that happens about six months into the relationship where the woman says to the man, I'd like to know about your sexual history. And the man says, oh, you **** wouldn't. But the woman just asks once and then move on. She keeps on asking and asking and asking until she gets the result. I had this recently, I was cornered, I had to have the sexual history conversation. I had to list every woman I'd ever been with. From the girl I lost my virginity to, right the way up to her. And that is where I should have stopped. Ladies and gentlemen, I've been Jimmy Carr. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you. APPLAUSE MUSIC MUSIC

 13 June 1997 Open Ladies andgy, welcome to the stage, chir�� of the office. Director, director, producer, length of a PC, Winner of three gold worlds, 2 point time manage and 7 actors. All the way from England, Mr. Retty Jabbay! Thank you! Hello, Chicago! Hello! Hello! Hello! Thank you so much! Thank you so much! Thank you! Thank you! That was amazing welcome! I should explain something straight away. Usually when I come out on stage, it's amazing, okay? I'm doing cartwheels and back flips. It's fucking spectacular, right? But I've hurt my back. That's true, actually. I've pulled a muscle in my spine playing golf. I know what you're thinking. Sir's been right for playing such a stupid game as golf. But, um, no, I've been in agony. I'm actually on painkillers right now. So, uh, no, it's true. If I suddenly start talking like Paula Abdul, you'll know why I know. Uh, not drunk. So, when the doctor, this is true, when the doctor gave me the painkillers, he said, no, you can't drink alcohol with ease. And I went, I don't want them then. Anyway, he went, what? I said, give me some, you can't drink alcohol with. And he went, well, you're not meant to drink with any painkillers. Who are you, my fucking mother? Just... So, I've been walking around like the elephant man for days. But without the big cock, obviously. I assume you had a big elephant's cock to match the head. No, that would make things all right. Then wouldn't it? That would sort of balance it out? No, because then he'd look in the mirror and he'd sort of go, oh, no. Oh, look at that fucking head. Oh, hold on, no, what's going on down here? Swinging round and round. Let's celebrate. The buns are on me. So, yeah, that's my problems. I didn't cancel, though. I didn't hate that one. And I asked, can't you cancel? Can't you cancel? Do you just saw a throw? Oh, I couldn't go on. I was depressed. I'll pour a little artist. Can you imagine the labourer trying that? Turn it on. I've got a little ticker on on Fed up. What the fucking bricks mate? Never cancel. I had a gig in Dublin a couple of months ago. As you know, Dublin is in Ireland, which is off the coast of Great Britain. It's not part of Britain, but it's very close. It's sort of like our Cuba, I suppose. It's done. And so, okay. Dublin, O to Arena, 10,000 seats sold out one in advance, flights, but really looking forward to it. A few days before the gig, they start grounding the aeroplanes because there's a volcanic ash cloud over Britain. And if you fly through it, apparently it'll make the plane fall out of the sky. And it was like, that was it. You couldn't fly in that. I mean, a volcano goes off in Iceland, and we can't... What was the point of Iceland, really? Do you want to be... Just fill in all the volcanoes with concrete, okay? Just, in fact, tarmac the whole country and make it a car park for real Europe, because it's a waste of fucking space, okay? And so, I'm thinking, well, I've got to get there. I can't cancel. And there were sort of pop stars and people coming over America and they were canceling their flight, because they couldn't get in and out. I thought, I can't. So, I hired a helicopter, two and from Dublin. It cost me 12,000 pounds, right? Just because I couldn't bear to let anyone down or take the ferry. That was... That was still running. Sure. But that would have meant mixing with the general public. And I don't... This is about as close as I ever... So, I don't know if you're affected by the volcanic ash cloud, but I had friends that were stuck all over the world and they missed weddings and funerals, and that had to put themselves up in a hotel for extra days or that budgeted for. And they couldn't get their money back, because the airlines were saying, no, we can't pay you, because the insurance companies won't pay us, because they're saying it's an act of God. Well, what isn't an act of God? Now, if you believe in God, that's sort of a definition of Him, isn't it? That he does everything. Isn't that right? Everything is an act of Him. He's all powerful. He's everywhere. He invented everything. There was nothing before him. He invented time. Everything. He's across it all. Okay? He doesn't miss a trick, and he's not absolutely minded of volcano going off. He's not going, fuck off the oven on. You know, it's... I know with these insurance companies that can decide what is an act of God. How do they know? Okay? Have they got a hotline to God? They called Him up, do they? Ring, ring, ring, ring. Yeah, look. Could I speak to God, please? Speaking. Oh, I didn't think you'd answer the phone yourself. What did you want? Oh, that volcanic ash cloud. Was that you? Yeah. Yes, that was an act of me, alright? So I shouldn't pay out. No, don't fucking pay him a penny, son. No. Brilliant, brilliant. What have I got you here? Did you make a tree fall on Steve Baxter's car? There's a lot of Steve Baxter's. Steve Baxter, two Akasia Road, Houndslow, it happened at 2.15 on the 3rd of June this year. 2.15, 3rd of June... No, that wasn't me. I was in Africa that day, giving aids to babies. LAUGHTER He does everything. He does everything. Mmm. I don't make the rules. Well, I'm glad I didn't cancel, because it's fantastic to be a senior. A happy, smiley face is probably feeling very fortunate that you managed to get a ticket to see a living legend. Or am I? And... Jala. APPLAUSE I know, I know. You lucky, fuckers. You really? I'm joking, of course. The pleasure is all mine. Thank you so much for coming out, spending your hard earned cash. I know there's been a recession on... Someone told me. I haven't really... Does it still go... I don't... It really didn't affect me if I'm being honest. LAUGHTER Oh dear. We can laugh about it now. No, come on. LAUGHTER I don't understand a recession. It wasn't until last year I found out you could go into your bank and say, can I withdraw my cash? And they could go, no. What? No. Got it. I've got £50,000 saved. You know. Where is it? Lost it. Have you checked the vault? It's empty. What was the point of that? You might as well have kept it in a joyous spot. A little twat. I hope you enjoy the show. Well, you'll let me know, won't you? If I say something funny, you're laugh, and I'll go, oh, I'll keep that in for the rest of the tour. If I say something funny, you won't laugh, and I'll lose that bit. So some bits tonight will be exclusive to you. They... They will be the shit bits, granted. LAUGHTER OK, let's start the show. Let's get on with it. No one wants to be here all night. You can have too much of a good thing. Garnia. Like heroin. What? LAUGHTER Although too much heroin is death, basically. That's when you know you've had too much... You've got a fuck of... I'm dead. A fuck. That's the thing, though, with heroin. You know, try anything once. Kids, sure. But know this. Right? No. You think, I'll try it. I'll try it, heroin. I'll just try one. Give me a heroin. OK? Just have one. Oh, what's it like? Oh, it's fucking lovely. I want more. I can't just tap... It's like pringles. It's like... One should pop. You can't stop. That's... I think that's how it works. I'm not an expert. Believe it or not, I've never been a heroin addict. No round of applause for that. See? No. No round of applause for never having been a heroin addict. If I ever come out and go, yeah, I used to be a heroin addict. I used to mug people and shit myself in doorways. Right? But, it's Ali. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He hasn't done those things for a while. He hasn't done those things that we never did in the first place. Why are you applauding someone for suddenly acting like a normal member of society? It's like... It's like I've lost a bit of weight. I've lost about 20 pounds. Exactly. No. No. You're basically applauding me for only eating as much as I need now. I should have... I should have always been doing that. I got fat because I was a greedy lazy. I was a greedy lazy bastard. There's no other ex-boy... And I... I... I need the people that... They can't be down. They go, oh, well done. You look great. But they won't tell anyone I looked terrible. They're basically saying I looked terrible. But no one told me at the time it was really taboo. I needed weight as to come over and go, fuck off. You've had enough. Right? And that I've been criticized in the past for having a go at fat people. I've never had a go at fat people. I've only ever pointed out the fact that you get fat. If you're taking more calories than you burn off. That's simple science. I don't judge them in any other aspect of their life. But that's how it happens. You get fat. If you're taking more calories than you burn off. Okay? And that's indisputable. Okay? Now, the thing is, people think I'm having a go. I'm not because I don't judge them. If I see a fat person, I don't make assumptions about him other than how they got fat. And this is the other thing. They not... No, wait, wait. Right? Not only is that what makes you fat. People know that's what's making them fat. No one got fat behind their own back. No one... And they went, what the fuck's that? Okay? It's not a surprise. It's a gradual process. You have loads of time to back out from this project. And he... Also, no one's sneaking into thin people's apartments. And injecting their lettuce with a million calories. That doesn't happen. Okay? They know what's... If you've got to blow it with these surrounded by cakes and pies. Right? And you go, you're not just making you fat, don't you? And you go, is it all the running? He knows what... But I don't make judgments. Okay? Other than how they got fat. Okay? If I see a fat person, I don't go, oh, he's fat. Therefore, he's jolly. Right? A lot of them miserable, aren't they? If... If I see a fat girl, I don't go, oh, she'd be pretty if she lost weight. That's rarely the case. Okay? So, don't fall for that. Okay? A lot of them started eating because they had fuck all to lose. So... No. But there's no stigma attached. Because people don't even want to use the word fat now. Because I think it's derogatory. It's a real taboo subject. So they use euphemisms. They go, oh, you know, Brenda, the big girl. What? Seven foot... No, no. Not to. She's like, Brenda, you know, she's the one who's clammy even in winter. Just say she's fat. Nothing wrong with it. Is there a choice up to you if you want to be fat? It's fine. They go, you know, Brenda, she's out of breath just standing up at her desk. But, even though it is their own fault, and it is their own fault, I think sorry for them. Right? Now I do. Particularly fat women, because fat is a feminist issue. Men get fat and we just go fuck it, all bought and paid for, you know. We don't come under the same constraints of society. Or as women are inundated with images of how you should be. Sci-zero models, this diet, that diet, look like this, keep your man. And they make such an effort, don't they, fat girls? They've all got lovely hair. Oh no, they're all having their hair. They've all got lovely hair. Oh, it's got lovely hair. Oh, it's got those lovely false nails. Oh no, they make an effort. Anything but jogging. Right? They love high heels, don't they? They think it makes their legs look less, it doesn't. It just... Even just here I'm coming now. I don't want any fat people to feel uncomfortable with one of my gigs. So next time, buy two seats. I'm joking, I'm just joking. Shada. I'm not having a go. I'm just pointing out, you know, I was listening to the radio in England a few weeks back. Radio 4, quite high brow. There was a discussion about political correctness. My name came up straight away, right? And there was a phone on there going, oh yeah, well it's not right. I'm Ricky Gervais and he makes jokes about fat people. He wouldn't make jokes about gay people, would he? And being fat is like being gay. What? No, it's not. What? You can't choose your sexuality. As we've established, you choose whether to eat too much or not. You know, with your sexuality, you're born, you grow up, you discover you like same sex relationships. And that's it, your gay, okay? For being gay, to me the same as being fat, you'd have to be born, be straight, grow up knowing your straight, but gradually and consciously, wean yourself onto cock. Oh, happy 16th birthday son. This is Raoul. Sook his cock. Sorry father. Sook his cock, 16 now. Sook his cock. I'm heterosexual. Oh, with his new fangled words. Sook his cock, come on. I don't like cock father. Doesn't like cock. How do you know if you've never tried it? Ah! Sook his cock. I've got sook a one cock. Sook, that's not sook in it. I was playing with it. Put it in your mouth. Put it. Oh, look, look, look. Have a go, you might like it. It's not so bad, is it? I fucking love these. If that happened, then being gay would be the same as being fat, but it doesn't. So it's not, okay? I was on a plane last year, okay, going from the beginning. Okay, going from New York to LA. And me and my girlfriend were one side of the plane. There was the aisle. And the other side there were these two huge fat women. Proper, proper, proper fat. One of them just got on and went, can I have about extension? Yeah, of course you can, you've earned it, right? So, proper. In fact, I was thinking of calling the pilot out and going, should one of us swap with one of them. Otherwise, we're just going to Canada. Do you know what I mean? Look. And one of them was even fat and the other one, okay? And she was there and she'd got on the plane with one of those takeaway buckets of fast food. Bucket. I mean, there's your first clue. When did that happen? When did fat people just give up? When did they go into a shop and go, oh fuck it, just treat me like a farm yard animal. Really? Give me it in a bucket. In fact, just strap it to my fucking head and I just, a bucket. Really, you want your meal in a bucket? Yes. Right? So, she's there and she's chowing down, right? And I swear, she turns to her fat friend and says, this is the best fried chicken I've had all day. But I'm not having a go. I'm not having a go. No, no, I'm not. Because even though it is their own fault and it is their own fault, I don't know if you know this about fat people. They fucking love cake. I love it. They love it, right? And I blame the food industries because you're going to supermarket and it's just packed with that stuff. Everything's packed with hydrogenated fats and extra calories and sugar and butter and everything. And they love that, okay? And there's always a big door, isn't there? To a supermarket? There's always a, they've got quadruple doors, isn't it? No one's ever been too fat to get through the door of a supermarket, okay? And it opens automatically. So after waste, calories pushing anything. There's just, and it's a good job at home, sort of, I'm actually choosing its glass and they can see the pie from down the road and they're in like that. Grazing, right? So I say, keep the big door, keep the big door, sure, keep the big door, come on fat people, come in and go. But when they get in there, it's all fresh fruit and veg. It's all whole grain, it's all stuff that's good for you, okay? Of course they'll be confused at first, that's not real food to them. They think Brussels Fouls is packaging, right? They're looking, where's the cakes? Where's the cakes? The cakes are over here, but the cakes are through a different door, but this door is human-sized, okay? So now they go, there's the cakes, they're going to, oh, fuck, I can't get in, I can't... I can't get through the fucking door, I can't... They're starving, I go, oh god, what's this, I got a pizza, what's this, a banana? Oh, no. And they're going, oh no, it's still got back another carrot. They're back and forth for days and the fat's fallen off them, so they can slip through the door. And I have a cake, they can't get out again. No, but I mean... But we've got to do something, we've got to intervene. And people say, no, it's not to do with you, it's up to them, it's their body, it's their life. And that's true, but we don't say that about wearing crash helmets, or if you've got a hair and addict in the family, you don't go, oh, it's his life, you love Zeroin. You know, you go, no, you've got to stop this, you'll, please, don't die. And you get him, and you throw him in a cupboard for three weeks or something. You can't throw a fat person in the cupboard, you're back in like me, but you know, hair and addicts, I don't weigh anything, you can throw him around willy-nilly, right? But when they lie in there with the needle hanging out, you just get the needle on flick, and they just go into the cupboard like that, okay? Fat people, you've got to lure them in. A little trial of chocolates, and they just follow that anywhere, like that. But we've got to do something, because a third of the world or a beast, and a third of the world are starving. The fat ones are eating the skinny ones food, basically. I know most of the skinny ones are in Africa, so outside out of mind, I know, but no, no. I can talk about Africa like that, because I'm from Britain, and we used to own it. We did. When we had the Empire, and we ruled the world before you took over, we used to, we owned Africa. But then in the 50s and 60s, Africa wanted to be south ruled, they wanted independence, and they said, look, we'd like to run ourselves, we went fine. So gradually we started giving Africa back to the Africans, and by the 70s, it was totally run by the Africans themselves. And of course, in the 80s, we get a phone call. Hello? Hello? Who's that? Africa. What do you want? We're starving. You should have thought of that. Before you wanted independence. Well, we didn't know there'd be a drought, did we? Drought, I'll give you a drought. This is true. When I was a kid, I was about 10, we had a really long hot summer, okay? And there was a hosepipe band. You couldn't water your flowers. We've all suffered. So that's true, actually. One long hot summer, and the water ran out, and we didn't know what to do. We thought, what could we do? And there was people coming around, you're house trying to tell you how to conserve water. They were saying things like, when you brush your teeth, don't let the tap just run. You know, put a little glass there. And they came around, they were putting house bricks in the system of the toilet to save water. And there was public information films on the television. There was one advert that was like an animation, and it was like a couple in the bath. And it said, conserve water. Take a bath with a friend. Which I did. I say a friend, he was more a friend of a granddad's. But no. Ten pounds is a lot to a kid in England. What? He taught me a lot. Stuff like, you don't wash it like that, give it here. No, it was a sweet old man. I used to call him granddad Charlie. He wasn't my real granddad. He was just no bloke that lived across the road. He used to come around whenever he saw my parents go out. He'd come around, momma and dad out, oh, you want to see a magic trick? Yeah, he'd draw the curtains. And he'd close my eyes. And he'd sit down, and he'd put a top hat on his lap, like that. A magic hat. And he'd go, close your eyes, it goes and feel the magic rabbit. And I used to go up and I used to go, I used to go in, I used to feel the little, the weird little thing it was. Didn't have any fur or ears, right? And he used to go, and it was scared stiff it was. It was terrifying. Right? And he made a stroke it for, and I stroked it so fast once that it was sick all down my... Shada, shada, faka. Oh dear. Oh. Well, was I, oh yeah, famine. Famine is a problem. Which brings me to this next fad that we need to stand out. This happened Christmas before last, exchanging gifts with old friends, good friends. Quite well off friends, if I'm being honest. I got them a coffee maker machine from Harrod's, top of the range. They loved it. They gave me my present, it was just an envelope. I thought, oh, what's this, vouchers? Open it up, it wasn't vouchers. It was just a card with a picture of a goat on it. And I said, what's this? They went, oh, our gift to you is we gave a goat to an African family. What? I'm looking at the coffee machine, is it too late to take that back? Is it too late? What is it? Oh, we gave a goat to an African family. Did you? Oh. So, I've got fuck all then, basically. I mean, I don't even know this African family. Why would I give them a goat? This serves no purpose at all. This is no good for anyone. They're 50 quid down. I've got nothing. The African family's going, not another mouth to feed. Right? The goat is going, where the fuck am I? What the f- this is? Shit! A wicking I was gambling around. The cot's rolled. There was grass and torus with nuts in it. This is a fucking dust bowl. There's no way that goat wanted to go to Africa. It was basically, no, it was kidnapped. It was abducted. It was put in a sack and bundled on a boat to Africa, like roots in reverse. There is no way. They went, do you want to go to Africa? You went definitely not. No, no. Oh, come on. Why don't you want to go to Africa? Lions! Come on. Why don't you want to go to Africa? I'd... Well, that shouldn't affect you. It shouldn't. So just be careful with that charity shit, particularly at Christmas. That's when they get you. They give you a guilt trip at Christmas. All the adverts of a charity at Christmas. You're sitting at home, aren't you? I mean, your Christmas lunch, loads of food, too much food. Probably going to throw a lot of it away. And things like this come on the Tony. This runs every Christmas day in England. It goes, is there an old lady near you, cold and lonely this Christmas? Yet a fucking hater. Noisy bitch, one's me up all year round. I can't wait for the cold weather. There's no old lady near me. She died last year of hypothermia, so result. Brilliant. The other big one is a doggy's for life. Not just for Christmas. Right behind that, I'm really into animal welfare. And that's obviously aimed at parents whose kids go, can I have a puppy? Can I have a puppy? Can I have a puppy? No, can I have a puppy? Oh, they get them a puppy to shut them up, right? And the kid likes it when it's cute. It grows up. The kid gets other interests, gets bored with the dog. They love the parents with it. The parents get bored with it. They abandon it. 11,000 pets are abandoned in England last year, which is terrible. And I think, you know, kids should have pets. I think it teaches them life lessons. I haven't got kids of my own, but I've got loads of niece and nephews. And they've got kids there, now. And I want to be a cool uncle and give them what they want. But I want to be a responsible one to and not add to the stray problem. But I think I've solved the dilemma. Here's a tip. This is what I do anyway. You've got a way to Christmas Eve. And I always go to an animal rescue centre, not a breeder. And I go along to an animal rescue centre, Christmas Eve. And I go to the veterinary part. And they've usually got, like a run, who's been born sort of disabled with no quality of life. And they're just putting that out of its misery. Right? And I go, no. Don't kill that one. I'll take that one. And they go, it's only going to live a day. Perfect. Perfect. So, and I run home. I'm going, don't die yet. Don't die yet. Little bit of Starbucks. Little bit of Starbucks. Oh, no, no, no. And I rush in. I call my niece. She comes running. I'm completely, I've got your puppy. Oh, you've got me a puppy. Yeah, your best uncle got your puppy. Yeah. Go and play with it. Go and play with it. I'm going to play with it. I'm going to play with it. I'm going to play with it. I'm going to play with it. I'm going to play with it. And she takes it to bed with her Christmas Eve. And she sleeps. And she wakes up. Christmas Day is dead. Cold. Steph gone. So, result. Not a problem. And they always come down the next day. They're going, oh, my puppy's dead. My puppy's dead. Oh, what the puppy your uncle got you. He did his bit and whatever happened after that. Isn't his problem. They go, yeah. And I go, oh, maybe you rolled over on it the night. Oh, did I? I don't know. Oh, no. And they start, I killed my puppy. I killed my puppy. I go, no, you didn't kill your puppy. Jesus killed your puppy. On his birthday. Because you didn't spend enough on your uncle's Christmas present. They usually put their ideas up the next year. The other big campaign at Christmas. Don't drink and drive. Right behind that as well. A lot more stigma attached to that these days. When I was growing up, it was whether you've got away with it or not. But people now know it sort of, it's, it wrecks lives. I'd be getting in a car when I was a kid with grown-ups and family. And they're going, no, you can't drive. You had too much to drink and they're like, oh, I won't get caught. And now that people know that's right. And I've done it once and I'm not proud of it. I'm fucking ashamed of it. And that was Christmas. I wasn't drunk, but I was over the limit. And I took the car out and I knew I shouldn't. I knew I shouldn't be driving. But I learned my lesson because I nearly killed an old woman. And no, in the end, I didn't kill her. In the end, I just raped her. But as I say, nothing came of it. Luckily for me, a thousand to one shot. She had Alzheimer's. So not a credible witness. Spiders. Oh, spiders. They're always ready, aren't they? Aren't they? They're always ready for action, a spider. It's always completely fucking ready for action, like that. Always ready for action. Always. I mean, some animals are sometimes ready. You start on a cat and they go, for a few seconds and it goes back to chill. Most of the time, a cat is just laying on the floor and it just on its side, all four limbs just stretched out in one direction. You will never see a spider like that. You will never see a spider just lying on the carpet. It's head down and all like legs just stretched out like that. They're always ready. They're always ready. And they're always ready in every direction, like the fucking matrix. Like that. They don't have to turn. They've got ten eyes, eight legs and ten eyes. It's over the top. And they're even ready when you don't think they're ready. You can see an empty web. Okay, and you go, that spider's not ready. No, touch the web. What? Touch the web. And it's there. Ah, I fucking hate them. 37,000 different species of spider. I mean, millions and billions of individuals in each species. And that's just one class, a ratnid, of one phylum, our fropter. There could be five million species of animal alive now on the earth. Best guess, okay? And that's one percent of all animal species that have ever existed. 99 percent of all animal species that ever existed and now extinct. And that remaining one percent is five million strong. Take one of those species, termites. If we were to weigh every termite alive now, it would be ten times the tonnage of every human being on earth. And it's statistics like that that make me think that this book isn't totally accurate. Um... It's the book of Noah. The children's edition. I actually got this awarded to me when I used to go to Sunday School every week. I believed in all this till I was eight. Um... It's an Agnes Sunday School presented to Ricky Givayas. R.I. Double Kayi. Like a fucking mongoose, right? For regular attendance. Not even for being good at anything, just for turning up, right? He's always there, give him a prize, he'll be back. Thank you. Thank you. Let's have a look at the evidence. Long, long ago, when God forbid, I'll let both of those points go, we haven't got time. Long, long ago, by the way, according to the Bible, was five thousand years. According to the Old Testament, the earth is no older than five thousand years old. It's actually four point six billion years old. Let's pop that in, pop that in. Four point six billion years ago, when God first made the earth and sky, oh, I don't big it up, it's like, it comes as a package, really, doesn't it? I mean... Do you know what I mean? The sky was never an option an extra. It's like, made your planet, I can't breathe. Would you like an atmosphere? Of course I fucking would, so... Well done, but... Everything was peaceful, everything beautiful. God made human beings too, and he wanted them to be good like himself, arrogant. Right? But very soon they wanted their own way. They would not listen to God, they became wicked and did wicked things. Look, I'm doing wicked things there. You don't get much more wicked than that, do you? Fuck off, I'll fuck off, wicked! Freak! Fuck off, wicked! Freak! Ah! God, just looking on, I'll carry on, see what happens, see what happens. I'll see what happens. Yeah. I'll see what happens. Bloke there, running off of the big bag of money. Don't put it in a bank, you can't. God looked at them and said to himself, they are so wicked, I will have to wipe them off the face of the earth. Really? Really? Straight to genocide? What happened to one verbal and two written warnings? Straight to the annihilation of the entire human race, because a fatty yellow trowels has picked someone's nose. Really? Fuck. Anger management, Matt, just calm the fuck down, let's cracklots. Just, just talk about this. Wow. I read that to Karl Pilkington, right? Who is, yes. Yes. He'd like the fucking orange, I know, yeah. And I read that bit to him, they are so wicked, I have to wipe them off the face of the earth. And Karl said, he sounds gay. I said, what do you mean? He went, some gays, a bit like that. He thought God was having a hissy fit, right? No, they treat me like a bastard, I'm going to treat them like a bimax show them. I'm a whethnaggot. I said, Karl, God is not gay, okay? Read the Bible, he hates them. They are so wicked, I will have to wipe them off the face of the earth. And every living thing with them, was the squid ever done? Weird God, they've gone mad. But he's not gay, God is not gay. But there was one man who was still very good, his name was Noah, he was a friend of God, just a friend, so don't know. Just a friend, a friend with big hooped earrings. Rouge. What, what's he do, he lives in a cave. What's he doing with this? What, what are you doing? Seeing God. You never know. Handle bar moustache. Holding God's hand. Who's wearing a blouse? God is not gay. God said to Noah, I'm so angry with men. You mean men and women? Whatever. I am so angry with men that I've made my mind up to destroy them all. I have stretched my bow in the sky, it's a rainbow. That's got to be the world's first pun, isn't it? It will make so much rain pour down on earth that everything will be drowned, but not you. I want it to build an art. It will be like a big boat with three decks and a roof over it. I know I'd build a boat, mate. Andrew and Michael Dora in the side of it. Do you think I could complete idiot? No, I did exactly what God told him. And then God said to Noah, okay, now this is aimed at children and admittedly. It's taken from the Old Testament story in the Bible, but I don't think the author of this book is a zoonologist. He said there could be five million species of animal. I don't think he knows them all the way, backs out very quickly in this next sentence. I want you to take two of every kind of animal with you into the ark. Two lions, two tigers, two elephants, so on. What, I brought lions, tigers, elephants, so on. There you go. Look after them well and keep them alive. Noah did what God said. Now I want to study that scenario. Okay, so God is angry with mankind. He's fed up with them, they're wicked. He's going to wipe them out and just start again with Noah and his wife. He's angry with the animals too for some reason. So he's going to start again with just two of each species. He calls a flood, they build an ark. That's right, two of each species, two, just two, right, quick. First two. Oh, there's a stampede. Two elephants, two two cons, just walking. Just, just, just. There's no rush. Just strolling, baby. I think this one is a bit more concerned than this one. This one's probably going, should we fly? No. No. No. I can't do this all night. No. No. Sure. Yeah. I mean, we've got wings. We've got feet as well. Why don't you want to push in? That elephant's looking at me funny. Yeah. I fucking have. If you try and push in, I'm going to stamp on you. You big nose, twat. Hold on. Are you calling big nose? What do you mean? No, I just pop call and kettle black. What the fuck does that mean? We know if a pot's, but I'll forget it. I can't forget it. I'm a fucking elephant. Oh. Two camels, two lions, two ostriches, two leopards, two tigers, two zebra. Ah, here's the crux of my point. Just one species on the arc at the moment, the giraffes. They've got their first longer legs. Five million more species to get on there. Two of it. Two animals on the arc at the moment. Ten million more animals to get. Ten million more of those. Ten million. As far as ten million of them to get on there, just two on there at the moment. Look how much room they're already taking up. It's a third capacity. What's it going to be like on there when these two fat cunts get on? Then God bent the bulb his anger and the rain came flooding down covering the earth with water. It rained for 40 days in nights. The flood water rose higher and higher until it covered the tops of the highest mountains. Every living thing was drowned except Noah and the animals in the arc. And the fish. They were fine, weren't they? They were fine. They were loving it. They were better off. In fact, all the sea creatures. I mean mountains underwater, they're domain had increased like tenfold. Also, it's so much more interesting. You've got crabs going, I'm on a fucking mountain. This is amazing. I never want this flood to work. I've never been up here before. I think of that when you see on the news. Like, if there's a little village in Gloucester flooded or something. It's really sad. You see people who have lost their homes and their in dinghies and they're carrying their pets. And you see a little rural antique shops completely underwater. And I think of a fish just looking in the window of the antique shop for the first time. So that's a shed long. For 150 days the earth was covered with water. Then now I open the window of the ark and looked out. The water seemed to be going down, but how could you be sure? Well, I ask God you've been chatting to him all the way through. Why are we... Why are we getting cryptic all of a sudden? He sent a raven out, but it soon came flying back. It could find nowhere to settle. No, I waited another week. Can he set out a dove? Why did the raven lose his job? But the dove came back too. See, the raven wasn't bullshit. This is... There was still no dry land anywhere. But one day the dove flew out and... Why did the dove get a second go and not the raven? Racist. But one day the dove flew out and brought back a green olive branch. And no one knew that God was no longer angry. Then God told Noah to let the animals out of the ark. Then once more, he'll feel the earth will live in things. The first thing Noah did was to build an altar. He offered a sacrifice to God to thank him for saving them. And Noah said, I will make a pact of friendship with you. I will never again send a flood to destroy the earth. The rainbow which I put in the sky will no longer be a sign of my anger, but a sign of peace. It will be a sign of my friendship with men. There it is. That is how it is used today. They took it literally. It will be a sign of my friendship with men, which begins today. And which my son Jesus will one day prove by shedding his blood for men. Who? Your see? There was... There was no teaser campaign in the Old Testament. But... Coming soon, the sequel. And... And so when you have done wrong and you are feeling very sad about it, think of the rainbow and the peace which God wants to put into your heart. He has promised to be your friend, promised to be his. And that is just one of 12 in the Dove Book series. I have only got one, number nine now. Although I think my favourite would be number eight just from the title, Jesus and the cripple. Thank you. Cheers. I read that whole book to Carl and he believed it all. Why wouldn't he? It's written down. And I said, Carl, think how could they get 10 million animals on a boat? Carl went, they said it was a big boat, yet they did. That's true. I said, but they are all part of the food chain. They would have literally had to have eaten each other to survive. Why didn't the lion eat the ant lope? Why didn't the spider eat the fly? And Carl said, because in a crisis you will pull together. Amazing. I would love to do a book of his quotes. I love books of quotations. I would just read them for pleasure. I have a few of these compilations. One of my heroes is Winston Churchill. And when I read, give us the tools and we will finish the job. I thought, how inspiring. And when I read, never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. I thought, how patriotic. And when I read, it is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations. I thought, you cheeky fat git. People always say to me that Oscar Wilde is the greatest genius that has ever lived. Let's have a look at the evidence. Here's one of these. All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That is his. That sounds a bit gay to me. Give me another one. I couldn't help it. I could resist everything except temptation. That sounds gay as well. I think. I want to start that with anew. I want to go, aw, I could now pitch. You know what I mean? And I want to end it with, I can resist everything except temptation. Chance will be a fine thing. And when he went through customs in New York, all those years ago, and the customs officer just doing his job said, have your own things declared, Oscar Wilde, famously said, nothing but my genius. Woo! Wasn't witty about you plan that. About the first time I went through customs in the foreign country, it was all yes sir, no sir. And he declared, no thanks, I need to go. Oh, I just thought something fucking brilliant was saying. Oh, I'm always doing that. Excuse me, can I go back to, no. Oh, yet wait weeks in those days, back on the boat to England, just think it all right. If they say that again, and then declare, nothing but my genius, I'll be in a book of rotations. He gets there again, weeks later, finds the same bloke, goes up to him, bloke goes on you go, didn't even fucking ask me that time. Excuse me, didn't ask me if I had it random, fucking random. Right, back on the boat, three weeks later, gets there this time, finds the same bloke, this time he's starting looking shifty, so he gets picked out like that. All right, bloke goes, goes. All right. Did you buy anything? That's not the question. Say it when things declare. Okay, have your own thing declare. Nothing but my genius, who's the butt plugs, fair mine? In castrated in Reading Jail for homosexuality, we've come a long way from it being punishable to total equality as it should be, of course. In England, the gauge you can send, same as heterosexuality now, 16, and even gay marriage. Although ironically, the one place that was really ahead of the game fell behind a little at the last election, California. They had a referendum, they put it to the vote, and they voted no to gay marriage. I mean, in California, there's people going, that's why we moved here. It's a strange sort of bigotry that you can affect someone else's lifestyle that doesn't affect you back. It's not like they asked a bloke once, sorry, do you mind if these two men get married? They went, no, fine. Okay, jack him off then. What? I didn't know that was going to happen. That doesn't happen. That doesn't happen. It's also a strange sort of bigotry because these people that object to that presumably the same people that said gay people were, immoral and promiscuous, but now they don't want to be monogamous and respectful in the eyes of God. And it must be so confusing to a gay guy in California thinking, that's the bit they don't like. With all the other shit we get up to, it's the marriage bit that must so confuse them, must go to judges and go, sorry, can I get the rules straight? What do you want to know? I just didn't know what we can and can't do. Ask away. Can I marry a man? No. Can I fucking put the arson, give him a little retrial? Please. I'm going to give him a little retrial. Please. Can't marry him. No. But in the middle. Come here. Can I pick up a stranger in the bushes and take him home and jizzle him and throw him out in the morning or crusty and homeless? Of course you can't, yeah. But I couldn't marry him. No. No and don't ask again. Can I line up 15 men? I'm just riffing here. Can I line up 15 men and just jack him off for a laugh? If you want? Yeah. Yeah. It would be difficult wouldn't it? Jacking off 15 men at once. It would be like plate spinning. No. Because you don't even need a tour once really. So you don't have these two ready to blow. But then they'd be losing it and you'd go, fuck it up. Oh, fuck no. Oh, fuck no. Oh, fuck no. Oh, fuck no. Oh. And it's Nakhrin. Jacking off 15 men at once. Never thought I'd say that. Oh. Again. No. There's these people that say being gay isn't natural. Well, it is natural. And I've got a book to prove it. Homosexuality occurs in about the same incident in the animal kingdom as it does in human society. This is a real book. It's called Biological Exuberance. Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity by Bruce Baga-Mill. Okay. The evidence is compelling and it seems there is virtually no species which does not have its gay community. That doesn't mean like chimps on one particular street wearing leather caps and stuff. They sort of spread it out more, really. This is a real book. Can we have the first slide, please? Right. Okay. Right. This is a real book. Okay. Right. Absolutely real. Okay. Two male stunk town macaques in Mutual Felatio. Mutual. They're sharing. They're sharing it around. Next slide. Okay. A male squirrel monkey, right, performing a general display toward another male. He's just going, what do you think of that? And this one's going, what? Suck it. Okay, his little hand. Why? Because we're gay. I'm not you fucking arm. Look at the way he's holding him and he's got his leg up for extra purchase. He's got, get in there, get in there, get in there. Look at him. Can you imagine my face when I discovered this book? Oh my God. Next slide, please. Ah, okay. A female Olympic Marmot mounting another female. Now, I don't know what is in that for either of them, unless the one on top is wearing a strap on Dildo. One more, one more slide. Oh, this is a doozy. Two forms of copulation between male dolphins, genital slit or anal penetration above, and below, blowhole penetration. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Basically, he is fucking him in the head. He's fucking him in the head. Like, I have never seen that on any wildlife documentary. I've never, why have I never seen that before? Why are they doing that? Maybe it's not in the wild. Maybe it's in Sea World, which is like their prison. And they're going, they're going, fuck, say. They put in two males. They, something we think we're fish. We might as well fucking do it, okay? I mean, look at his face. Ha. He's going, Dave. What? Could we not do it at the ass like them? No. It's in the head or nothing. Dave, what? What? Dave, Dave. I love you. But I can't fucking breathe. That is a real book. That is a real book. Can we have a look? I love the fact that he found like a turkey and drag. To show how gay animals could be. The gayest animal in the world. I hope I haven't offended anyone with any of the subject. No, I do. I do. I don't want to try and offend. If I have offended anyone and I'm sure I have, I don't apologize. No, I think you should be able to justify everything you do. I think a comedian should take you to a boo place you haven't been before. Otherwise you could do it yourself. There's enough anodyne comedy out there doing things obvious stuff. There's this spate of comedians saying sorry when they go too far. You should know better than that. There's a witch hunt at the moment with people saying, is there anything you shouldn't make a joke about? No, there's nothing you shouldn't joke about. It depends what the joke is. Comedy comes from a good or a bad place. It's for you to decide what that is. I think there's a big debate about sick jokes. The thing about sick jokes, when we tell a sick joke, it's with the express understanding that neither party is really like that. I wouldn't tell a sick joke to a known pedophile. I wouldn't go, mate, you're going to fucking love this more than anyone's son. It's not up. I've never been in trouble for anything I've said in my professional career, because I refuse to apologize. What can they do? Growing up, you try things out and you get taken the wrong way a little bit. I mean, you know, not... When I was about 23, 24, me and my girlfriend met up with this other couple. They'd moved down from the north of England to London. They used to come in the place, so they used to work. We had a couple of drinks for them. They were cool people and they were fun. After we met them a couple of times, they invited us to a party at their house. We went along. One, it was a dinner party, which they hadn't warned us about. One, it was for their family that had come down from the north to see how they were getting on. Both that said parents and grandparents and great uncles average age about 85. I think we were in afterthought. Oh, God, we don't know anywhere on our age. Oh, that Ricky and Jane. We went along and we were still getting to know them, so we just spoke to them all night. We didn't really mingle with the older people. As I say, we use comedy as a sword and a shield and a medicine, but usually as they get into know you, okay? We use comedy to break the ice. Are you like-minded? What can you take? What do you like? And I've always sort of pushed the boundaries a little bit to try and make people laugh at things they didn't think they could. But then everything turns out okay, I suppose. And I started off lightly. I told this joke. Why did the little girl fall off the swing? Because she had no arms. Yeah, sweet. And they laughed a little bit louder than that. There was only two of them, so thanks. No, so I thought, okay, they get it. They let us go and show you up the ante a little bit. I don't know, you push. And I told this joke. Oh, I need a drink. Start the car, seriously. All right. I told this joke. Make sure the old people couldn't hear. I went, okay, father sitting at home, just reading the newspaper. This little girl comes running in. She's only six. Hello, darling. Hello, darling. You've been playing, yeah, in the park. Yeah. With your friends. One till the man came along. Yeah, man came along. And he asked my friends to leave, so it was just me and him. Darling, go over. Whatever happened, none of it was your fault. Okay, darling. None of it was your fault. But tell daddy every detail what happened. He took me behind a tree, so you know I could see what you were doing. Oh, God, darling, and then what happened? He took my dress off. Oh, God, what happened next? He took his thing out. Oh, God, darling, and then what happened? Nothing, that was it. Oh, we'll make something up. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE CHEERING CHEERING APPLAUSE CHEERING APPLAUSE CHEERING APPLAUSE CHEERING CHEERING Thanks. APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Don't tell anyone that. I wanted to be a surprise. So I told that joke. Carried on, getting a bit drunk. I told that joke. Carried on, getting a bit drunk. I was telling jokes. I eventually sat down for the meal about quarter to ten. They put two tables together. And the host sat at either end. And they put me in the middle opposite this very sweet, but very deaf sort of 80 year old man. So conversation was a bit stilltied. And after about 20 minutes, Ian, one of the host, pipe sound, said, oh, Ricky, tell that joke. All the people went, oh, we love jokes. Do you? LAUGHTER I looked at Ian and he went, be fine. OK. And he got on with his conversation. And so they're all like that. I went, um... Oh, father sitting at her own ring of faith. Little girl comes running. Told the whole joke. Got to the bit. Well, make something up. They went, oh, silence. I looked at Ian and he went, not that one. Thank you so much. You've been fantastic. Good night. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Please. Thank you. Fantastic. Thank you so much. I fucking love Chicago, isn't it brilliant? Isn't it amazing? I've had just the best time. Thank you, thank you so much. I'd risk coming again through volcanic ash clouds. Anything to get, it's phanta. Terrorist attack. I've actually always been a nervous flyer, to be honest. And I flew a few weeks after 9-11. And after 9-11, the world went a little bit crazy. Understandably, the rules changed. There was a lot of anger and fear and confusion and finger pointing. And I'd always consider myself quite a rational, liberal sort of guy. And I tried to remain that way after 9-11. And even in the pub with mates, I'd be the one who was going, no, you can't say that. No, that's a generalisation. That's ridiculous. No, that's unfair. You can't tire over with the same brush. No, it's still the safest form of transport. It's 16 million to one, the chance of a, you know, trying to be rational. That's in a pub. When I'm flying, it's more like, check him again. Can we check him again? He's getting on this, do you mind if I check him? Can I just... And after 9-11, with all the checks, I'd still try to remain sort of rational for the softwares thinking, right, it's harder now than it ever was to get a bomb on the plane. This is, you know, it's the restrictions are tight, it's safer now. And then I found out that a terrorist doesn't even have to get on the plane now with a bomb. They found heat-seeking missiles and they could just park up in some sort of lay-by and take the plane out in the first 10 minutes of take-off. So now I'd be on the plane going, right, we're out of range, who's got the bomb, right? And as I saw, I flew a couple of weeks after 9-11, internal flight and we're up in the air, I don't think we're out of range, right, okay, I'm still a bit nervous. And I said to the air hostess, I said, if you've got any magazines, think of this. She said, quite loud, quite blase, she said, no honey, we've got no magazines, we've had to undertake severe cutbacks because we're one of the companies being sued over 9-11. One, don't mention 9-11. Surely a new rule but went round. Don't mention 9-11 when you're handing out the coffee, just, you know what I mean, right? Two, don't say severe cutbacks. Severe cutbacks. If someone says that, I don't think of magazines anymore. I think of a bloke in an aircraft hangar. Earlier that week going, do we really need all these rivets? It's just, what, terrible midside manner. I mean, I take first class flights everywhere. I know you wouldn't have it any other way. I do it for you, really. Some of the flights I take cost 10,000 pounds, okay? And for 10,000 pounds in a disaster, I expect the front end of my plane that I'm into gently break off and float down to a desert island. It doesn't. I die with the rest of you fucking losers. That's not fair, isn't it? I know you tried to save me but you couldn't. We're just beyond the news. I probably only want to get name checked on the news. You'd be tuned in 30 others but I was just some consolation. But anyway, so, okay. Once I was flying back from New York, okay, 925, a Saturday night, JFK, to London Heathrow, BA, first class. Okay. Now, this is my point. It's fear that threatens rational thought, I think. Okay. I'm there. Now, the whole week leading up to that fly, I don't know if you remember it or it's happened more than once. I don't know. It was a couple of years ago. On every news channel in America, there was a rolling ticker tape that said America on Red Alert. We've had in town, there's going to be another 9-11 in a major city, probably New York or LA, okay, this weekend. Do not fly unless you absolutely had to. I had to. I was filming. I'm the only one in the first class lounge. I still try to remain rational. I was thinking, no, it's safer now. Everyone's looking for a terrorist today. They leave it till Monday. Then it happened. The thing that threatened my rational thought. I had a little bit of a mini breakdown. Into the first class lounge, about 30 minutes before boarding, came this guy. I don't know if there was North African or Middle East or Asian, but yeah, all the gear. Beard. Steer the Tasha case. Okay. And here's your middle class sort of liberal. I went. I was suddenly engaging staff in sort of banal conversation. I fly on time. They're going, yeah, what's the weather like in London? Like they were going to go, it's a bit cloudy, but there is, right? Didn't happen. So I'm left there, right? And I'm looking over it in. And I'm thinking of all the running up to it and the weak, the news, nothing. But now there's a fight between good and evil, between rational and irrational. Okay. This one goes, oh, that's a suicide bomber. Oh, very stupid. Of course it isn't. It is. How do you know? That's what they look like. What? Beard. Don't be stupid, right? Then he makes a phone call and I couldn't understand what he was saying, but he sounds a bit angry. Okay. This one goes, oh, we made a phone call. All right. This one, no, you just made a phone call. Yeah, but not in foreign. A shot up, right? He's been checked, without the rest was been checked. Did they check the beard? Yeah, they checked the beard. Yeah, they checked the beard. And then I'm looking at him. It must have been absent minded with all this going on in my head. And he catches me looking and he does this. He goes, oh, he knows, he knows. Right? This one goes, no, he knows why you're looking at him. He said that sort of prejudice for months now. Stop looking at him. You're not a beard. Yeah, right? But this one starts winning. The fear starts beating all the rational thought in the world. He says, going, no, it could be what you could be. Probably not. Well, no. The stats are up today. Yeah, but still it won't happen. Don't say it won't happen to us. People have 9-11 until it wouldn't happen to them. Yeah, but all the tests. Yeah, where they find new ways of getting through our detection. Then we have to open a game. Yeah, you're right. And suddenly I thought, I'm a god. This is it. This is it. And that wave of nausea. And you suddenly realize, oh, my god, I'm witnessing this. This one goes, okay, right? Let's report him. This one goes, no, why? In case someone thinks we're racist. No, fuck that. Let's report him and be a wrong, embarrassed, live racist, just in case. I don't know. So I don't. And so now I think he is a suicide bomber. And I think I'm going to get on the plane and die, but I'm not going to do anything about it. And I'm nearly in tears. And all this happens in a few moments. And I look over, and he's joined by his wife who's got all the gear. And it's two little girls, okay. And I suddenly go, of course, he's not a fucking suicide bomber. If you're off to see 72 virgins, you don't take the wife and kids along. So no, true. And I got on the plane and of course, he wasn't a terrorist. Now, I was sort of a bit embarrassed and I saw the funny side of it. And that was relieved, you know, and then he was a businessman and a family man. He was playing with his two little girls who kept running up and down and banging into my chair. He wasn't doing anything about that at all, okay. No, he wasn't doing anything about that at all, okay. And he was sort of chasing him and I was squealing really, really going through it. After half an hour, I was hoping someone would blow the fucking plane up. But a really weird thing happened during that period. I got so paranoid about terrorist attack that I started taking private jets and helicopters everywhere just because I was so rich. No, no. No, again, my philosophy was, I'm the only person on this plane and I definitely haven't got a bomb. So we're all right, you know. And I was taking a helicopter one day and I was waiting on the helipad, okay. Rewind two days before that. I'm at home, I have a material, materials, and there's a carton of milk there with the missing person things on the back. And I've seen a thousand of them, okay. This one was slightly different because it was a missing child, which is always sadder. Well, no, it's sad when anyone goes missing, but presumably because of her age, this was an abduction and, you know, and it was also the language. It was a plea from the mother and it was the wording. She just said the name of the little girl, which I won't say, I remember it, and the day and place where she was last seen. And she just said, five years old, blonde hair, blue eyes, always happy, please help me. And it must have stayed with me. Two days later, I'm there. It's like a wolf development waiting for this helicopter. And I'm looking down on to sort of some disused sort of warehouse space. And I'm looking one, right. And someone had put up a brown blanket with this duct tape, okay, as like a curtain. And it had fallen away. And I can see in, this is true story, it's an empty room, apart from a mattress. And on the mattress is a little girl with her hands tied. And my fucking heart, five years old, five years old, blonde hair, blonde hair, blue eyes, blue eyes, always happy. Crying in the eyes out. What? It couldn't have been there, I left it. Thanks very much, you've been amazing. Good night Chicago. Cheers. Thank you. Cheers. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Cheers. Thank you. Cheers, everyone. Good night, everyone. Thank you.

 Why do you pick San Francisco to shoot your special? This is one of the best tales I ever do comedy and this is the most historic venue you got as far as comedians have concerned because many brews ripped it down. All the best came through the bay. What about Richard? What about the Ryan Williams, Tarlan, Mooney? All they said have to be the biggest star. As long as you come with it and people coming out they like to see live performances because it's a savvy audience. San Francisco, all you better! I don't need you to give you all you better! Welcome to the show, here for... The show's finally over! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, man. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I'm throwing it all right. Yes, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you for coming. God damn. I did it big this year. From cable nigga God damn. Thanks for coming out and thanks for making a niggas feel comfortable and the gayest place on earth. You guys got Disney World jealous out this motherfucker. Man, I didn't really think it was that gay at first. I was like, what is everybody? Because when I was coming out here when I was like, man, that place is really gay. So what the fuck is everybody talking about? It's not so gay. And then I wanted into that Castro God damn. I said, this is America's anus right here. This shit is deep. Went to that tenderloin. Nothing tender about that motherfucker at all. That shit was rough. The opposite of tender. I have never seen crack smoke so casually before. These niggas were sitting in front of Starbucks smoking crack and drinking coffee. I said, this is all for look. Talk about politics. I see one crack here trying to break into somebody's car. Man, it struck a chord. I tried to stop. I said, hey, and he looked back and saw me and said, oh, keep it out. It's a nigga that was me that said that. I'm trying to help you. I want this shit to stop. Crack here is a like that. I had a crack here break my car window one time. Broke it. You know he stole fucking candy ball. I had a line on it and say this all he took. The goddamn candy ball. I was so mad. I drove around in neighborhood for five hours. Looking for a crack here but chocolate on his face. I did that. I finally found my favorite motherfucker. I said, hey man. What's all this chocolate on your face? Motherfucker. He looked confused chocolate. This is dude-oo, baby. I said, ah. Oh, man. This place is insane. But you know what I like about saying, friend, and the reason I picked this city to do my special is because if all the major cities in America somehow people get along here better than anywhere else I've seen in the country, that's right. That's right. And I always admire saying, friend, for that. And today I've realized how you did it. Put all the nigs on the other side of that bridge. There's nothing that's shit that ain't happening on that side. You leave your sandwich sister like, boy, thanks for coming to San Francisco. Come back in April we're having a sale on Birkenstocks. Since we get to the other side, well when I'm going bitch. Quick. Thanks. It's fucking crazy. But it also feel like it's the East Coast city in the West Coast. You guys got subways and shit. I'm scared of public transportation. I was on a bus that was held hostage. 45 minutes. It wasn't like for it and I don't want to give you that impression. It was a dude jerking off but the shit was scary son. Who's scary? It was right before it happened I was on the bus smoking a cigarette. It's a long story. It's not the coolest shit I ever did and people freaked out. Sir! Sir put that goddamn cigarette out okay? Everybody's air sir. I picked it. I didn't want any trouble. Just in that moment coincidentally this home was due. I don't know where it pulls the dick out. Started beating off and I was furious. Because nobody said shit to this guy they were just looking like. God. I was the only one on the bus that had the balls and the same thing to him. And it's not even like I was brave really. It was that you know. I was sitting next to the motherfucker. I had to say something. Come on dog you hitting my elbows. Son of a stop. It's all I said I don't want to say too much. Guys beating off on the bus means something wrong with this motherfucker. He's not wrapped so tight I didn't want to push him over the edge. As soon as I said something all these dummies on the bus now they're brave. Oh he's right. Put your goddamn cock away. I don't want to see this anymore. I don't want to see it either. Yeah. Not a guy flips out. All right everybody back up. Back up up up. I tried to be nice about this. Now everybody freaks out. Oh my god. It's a biological take off. I'm caught in the middle. I can't lose my cool. I said hey everybody calm the fuck down. You don't get me shocked. It's all just be cool. Let's do what this man says. So he'll leave his own. Now everybody gets quiet. That's better. That is better. And then he started walking up and down the house. There's terror as in us. And then he starts making demands. You and the pink shirt. Squares are tips together. Oh god no. No. You stick your finger in your butt. Oh god what is this happening? Oh god. He was working my way. Shit was tight. Just that minute. I got saved. I was so lucky. This guy, the other end of the bus, he snapped. He lost his mind. I seen it happen. Ah. Screamed out. Grash him. He can't come on all of us and charge him out. Ah. And there's like a movie that's home to the dude. He's seen him coming. Shot one all. Ah. I thought it was actually like the Matrix. Look at all. You got behind me. Wasn't so lucky. No. I said it was gross. It didn't kill him but it was. I didn't sure that fuck this day up. I'm not going to have no idea if the home is dude. Bus the none of your forehead and eight thirty in the morning. That's a wrap on the rest of the day. Ah. This guy was freaking out. It burns. Oh. Oh. Everyone's standing around looking. Even the home is dude felt bad. I guess he was finished. He came back to his senses. Oh. This is my stuff. I said relax. I'm on the fuck ahead and say something. Relax. I got to know it. I said you can't get AIDS from the home's dude. Bus the none of your forehead. It's not how it spreads. I don't even know if that's true. That's just what I told him man. He was so scared I had to say something. I'm the way AIDS comes from. Who the fuck knows. Scientists don't even know. Scientists still say AIDS started because somebody had sex with a monkey. Word. After all this research is the best explanation that she came up with. Nobody fucks monkeys and people you idiot. You either fuck monkeys or you fuck people. That's it. There's no end between it. You're not going to get some monkey pussy on Tuesday and then be like, I'll let me call Charlene on Thursday. Once you fuck a monkey that's a firm decision. I'm out of the human pussy game for good. It's ridiculous. You act like monkeys are just as open as waiting for people to fuck. But the monkeys don't want to be fucked by people. Think about it. Think how hard it would be to catch a monkey. And fuck it. That's ridiculous. That's how it had to go. You think you're just going to walk up to him in the woods and grab this nigga with fruits and bananas? Hey buddy. Hey. Yeah. There you go buddy. Yeah. Yeah. Here you go. Your big bright red ass. It's a big bright red booty. You know how strong a monkey is? With a rip you dig old like the celery stalker's psh. Throw that shit in the tall grass. It'll never be seen again. Hey, doll. We're going to go to the club. Pick up some girls who are trying to row. Nah man, I'm cool. I'm going to stay home, doll. Chill with my monkey. You know how long it took me to train this monkey to suck my dick without peeling it? Last night, chim chim jerked me off with his feet. I think only a monkey can show you that kind of love and tenderness. So y'all keep fucking these people if you won't make this monkey pussy for me. Hook it up with an orangutane next week. That's all I fuckers. Chimps and orangutans. No, I feel real bad for his Indians. Everybody feels bad for Indians. They get doled openly because everybody thinks they're dead. These motherfuckers are not all dead, all right? I've seen with my own eyes I've seen a gathering of 1500 Native Americans. They were all gathered in one place. The place is called Walmart, New Mexico. I've never seen Indians before. I wasn't even sure if they were Indians. I fucked up, but I asked one of them. It's not nice, but I've seen them in the sports section looking at bows and arrows. They're saying something. Oh, excuse me. I don't mean to be rude. Are you Indian? And he was cool. Yes. Yes, I'm Indian. Still didn't believe him. I had to test him to be sure. This is fucked up. But I had a gum wrapper in my pocket. So I balled that shit up and I threw it on the floor. And a single tear came out of the ass and I said, oh shit. I had so many questions. What trap are you from? I am a Navajo. I said, it worked. I studied you in social studies. You're a hunter-gatherer, correct? I said, I guess so. That's what you wish to call it. I said, why, what do you call it? I said, I am an alcoholic. I said, what's your name, dog? He said, please. Dog is my cousin. That's a good guess. My name is Ronan Coyote. What is your name, friend? And that shit called me off-guard. I didn't want to say my name was Dave, two motherfuckin' names, Ronan Coyote. This don't feel good enough. He was putting me on the spot. I said, huh? My name's black. Oh, my name's Blackfeet. Then I changed the subject. Forget about me. What's going on with you? You need to eat your chief. Why don't you and your chief and your friends get together tonight? We could have a real-life piece pipe smoke and ritual. We need to celebrate. And I thought you were dead. And he set it up. It was beautiful. It was just like I dreamed. It was all sitting around. And then he was beating the drum. Other Indians came out the back with a long blanket that was folded in half and put it in front of us. And then he opened that shit up. And on the blanket was a long wooden pipe with feathers. And bags of weed were all over the blanket. Chief walked over. The big ones are 50. The little ones are 25. And these are 10. Men and Indians got high as shit. I was beggining. I told the chief. He was talking. I cut him off. Time out, chief. Sorry in the rub. Fucking smash, man. The weeds too strong. I'm injured. Is this piece repeated? The spirits have got me. Chief, the spirits have got me. And the chief threw some water in my face. Calm down, blackface. Splash. I said, hey, is Blackfeet motherfuckin' take it easy? Blackfeet. You're a welcome to stay amongst me and my tribe for the night. Until the spirits leave you. And they gave me my own TP to sleep in. Which sounds nice. I personally felt like it was a little fucked up. You know, because they all had houses, man. It's like, why can't I sleep? We're showin' a house and watch TV. They got to keep ya on this grayish all night. And he ends the room, man. Everybody's room. And he ends the eating nasty food. All they ate was corn and shit. Doritos, the thing they call. That's great. People only see the surface. They see the division in our foods. Just because I eat chicken and watermelon. They think that that's some wrong with me. Let me take some. If you don't like chicken or watermelon, something's wrong with you motherfuckin' There's something wrong with you. Where are all these people that don't like chicken and watermelon? I'm sick of hearing about how bad it is. It's great. I'm waiting for chicken to approach me to do a commercial. And they got all good... Now, do it for free, chicken. At least I can do it. They make fun of Latin people for eating... Which, y'all eat beans, rice, corn. Listen, that's not a reason to hate a motherfucker. It's funny, but it's not a reason to hate. The only reason these things are even an issue is because nobody knows what white people eat. You've been very good at keeping that shit a secret amongst the sales. I study white people. You don't know that. I'm writing a paper on you. Not even for school. Just to do it. Just to get some food. Doing independent research. Spending my money is why I'm working so hard. I follow you around grocery stores. They freak out. I just try to peek in the cart. They always say, get away from my cart, everybody look at. Chicken and giblets are over there. You must be lost. These are vegetables. I know what you drink. See how quiet I got. Great juice. Surprise motherfuckers. You didn't know I knew about grape juice, did you? Oh, no play dumb with me. Look at what? A lot of black people don't have the privilege of knowing about grape juice. Because they have grape drink. It's not the same formula that you give. Ain't no vitamins in that shit. You might have one of your black friends over Todd. Todd? Would you care for a glass of grape juice? What? Look at what the fuck is juice? I want some grape drink, baby. Oh, it's purple. I don't think I know what a grape drink is. What? I have some apple juice. If you want what the fuck is juice? I want some apple drink. Scream. Remember that commercial for Sunday to Light? When all the kids run in from outside playing, they all run to the fridge. All right. I got some purple stuff, some sunny deep. As soon as they say sunny deep, all the kids go, yeah! Watch the black kid in the back. If you ever see that commercial, look at that black kid. He'll be like, I want that purple stuff. And that's drink, make that is drink. They want drink. When I want him vitamins, make that drink. Sugar, water, purple. That's ingredient, sugar, water. And of course, purple. It's too fucking much. I got a lot of things to talk about tonight. First of all, I've stopped smoking weed. When black people, you didn't let me finish, my motherfucker. It's goddamn. I'm sorry black people to break the news so publicly, but I can't smoke with you anymore. At the time I smoked weed with my black friends, all you talk about is your trials and tribulations. I'm sick of that shit. I got my own problems. They're gonna say, waste the weed. I'm smoking weed to run away from my problems. I take only yours. Now on, I smoke weed exclusively with white people. Calm down, motherfucker. You win by default. You got good weed conversation. All white people talk about when they get hacked is other times that they got hacked. I can listen to that shit all night. Do you remember it, Franks last week? It's fucking smashed, man. And catalogs, everything they drink. It's too short, seeyeager. Kill, four-bong hitsman. Beer, cheeseburger. That shit is great. Only bad part is you cannot pass out around white people. Every time white dudes pass out around each other, they always do some boredom, man. Gay shit when the guys are sleeping. Frank fell asleep so we stuck a keratin' ass in it. To shave and cream on his balls. Why, motherfucker? Why did you do that to a friend of yours? He trusted you enough to sleep around. You're gonna put a keratin' ass in that nice. I'll tell you right now, if I put a keratin' of black dudes out there, you will kill you when he wakes up for some shit like that. That is an automatic bed sentence on the street. So rat for you, I'm gonna kill that motherfucker. I thought y'all was friends, baby. What happened? I fell asleep at his house, right? We was drinking, and I fell asleep at his house, and while I was sleeping, right? I'm just gonna kill that motherfucker, all right? That's all you need to know. Fuck carrots. But everybody's getting along. I see that shit. I see it all around. Blacks and whites don't fight so much. You know who don't have no beef with anybody is Asian people. I see how y'all be doing. Y'all just laying the cut. All people are Asian people beef with is other Asian people. Like if you call a Korean guy Chinese, I've done this. They will flip out. Hey! Let's make a think of Chinese. I am Korean. I look Chinese. Yes, motherfucker, you do look Chinese. That's why I said it. It's accident. Look at the untrained eye. You all look Chinese to me. It's a mistake. I'm not trying to offend you. Some people say all black people look alike. We don't get bin out of shape. We normally just call those people police. Okay? Just learn to live with them. That's all I can tell. Everybody is afraid of police now. I'm scared of death of these police. I am. I got a police scandal. First money. I got this a first and I went out. But when I bought me a police scandal, I just listened to these motherfuckers. Before I go out. Just to make sure everything is cool. You hear shit on it. Calling all cars. Calling all cars. Be on the lookout for a black male between 4-7 and 6-8. Staying in the crib tonight. Fuck that. That work on that alibi for a minute. Every black person needs alibi. I do them impromptu joints. If I'm by myself and need to out, I just open up the windows and apartment. Turn on lights on. Stop beating all of Friday and the window. Look at me. Hey everybody look, this is me. They should pay on praise. I'm jerking all over. Nope the time motherfuckers is 2.35. Look at me. I'm jerking all over the window. 2.35. I'm jerking all over the window. 2.35. Community days you pay all those junk stamps. Nope the time. That shit could save my life. Officer David Shapel couldn't have done that. I saw him in his window masturbating. From 2.35 to 2.37. I'm certain of it. He was standing on a clock and holding a calendar and today's paper. Fuck I need alibi. I can't be no celebrity shit. I can't be no celebrity shit is just the worst. I'm seeing it. I can see why I see why stars are crazy. These motherfuckers. I want to diss me world of my kids, which is a big deal for me. I don't get to see my kids so much. I do Shapel show. 20 hours a day. Sleep for like half an hour. Raise my kids for 10 to 20 minutes. And not go back to work. Now. This particular day I got to hook up with the kids we went to business. We're everybody at the park. Fucking everybody. Hey, hey, Rick James bitch. Hey, Rick James bitch. It's like, hey man, hey. You might not call me a bitch in front of my kids. Time out motherfuckers. We take it they all. Even Mickey Mouse did it. I said, this is the most unprofessional shit I have ever seen in my life. Rick James bitch. Oh, I was fed up. I caught that motherfucker with the uppercut. Bop. Knocked his head clean off. Everybody was screaming. Oh my god. Oh my god. Mickey Mouse is Mexican. I had terrible time in Disney World. Disney World is like a whole other country anyway. They got their own currency. That shit is ridiculous. As soon as I check in the hotels, welcome to Disney World. Mr. Chappelle can we interest you in some Disney dollars? Nah, man, I'm cool. Can't buy weed and pussy with Disney dollars. I'm on vacation. I like them greenbacks. I like them greenbacks. I'm saying there's a kind of money people spend. People is very particular about that. I saw that. That was one of the main stories from the war. It was the first big thing we did. It was a sad story. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. They did. Now that I retired, we have managed to take Hitom who say face off of the money. The press conference was shocked. I was really proud to find an American because that's a very subtle psychological new wanted to have a dictate on his money. It is thoughtful to take off every ever else. If you can do that, I'll write something down here. What about our money, man? Our money looked like baseball, cause we slave homes on. George Washington is the worst, the worst. Yes, I said it. You mythologized as a motherfucker. He was the greatest dude, man. If I went back in time with a white person and we saw George Washington walking in front of our time machine, my wife from would probably be like, oh my god, Dave, look, there's George Washington. He tends to father of this great nation, and go shake his hand. I'd be on the other side like, run, nigga, George Washington. And we both be right. You like him because he wrote the Declaration of Independence and all that shit. We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men are created equal. Go give me a sandwich, nigga, I'll kill you. Liberty, justice for all. Am I wrong? Am I wrong? Wait a minute, did he not own slaves, did he own slaves? That's why I saw him saying it. I almost protested at the war in the beginning. Almost. I tell you I saw what happened to him, Dixie Chicks. I say, fuck that. If they'll do that to three white women, they will tear my black ass to pieces. I don't wanna hear that shit. Yeah, man, they would. But I'm like, for real, why? Why do you care so much with the Dixie Chicks? It's not like they political scientists, and they just bitch, they can sing good. You know what I mean? Stop worshipping the celebrity so much. Just don't listen, pay attention. I remember right around September 11th, the job rule was on MTV. They said, we got job rule on the phone. Let's see what jobs thoughts are on this tragedy. Who gets a fuck with job rule things at a time like this? This is ridiculous. I don't wanna dance, I'm scared to death. I want some answers to job rule, right? Not have right now. I think when bad shit happens to me, I'll be in a crib like, oh my god, this is terrible. Because somebody, please, find job rule, get hold of this motherfucker, because I can make sense of all this. Where is job? I have me job rule. I don't even know why people listen to me. I'll say anything, Nick, I've done commercials for Coke and Pepsi. I don't give a fuck, what comes out of my mind? By the say what it takes, whatever it takes, that's what I'm saying. If you wanna know the truth, can't even taste the difference. Surprise! I know it was Pepsi paid the most recently, so taste better. It's pretty much how the game goes. I'm just being real, man. There's too much goo-gog and over-seller, but people don't know it was fake and what's real anymore. That's why Bill Cosby got in trouble. Look what happened to Bill Cosby. Bill Cosby says some real shit and the whole world freaked out on him. For what? For having an opinion, just because he was selling puttin' pots for the last 40 years, people forget that he's the nigga from Philly in the projects, and he might say some real shit from time. It's not that big of a deal. I spoke at my old high school and I told him, Kia is straight up. If you guys are serious about making it out of this ghetto, you gotta focus. You gotta stop blaming white people for your problems. And you've gotta learn how to rap, play basketball or something. Making your track, you are trapped. Either do that or sell crap. That's your only option. That's the only way I've ever seen it work. Better get the entertaining news white people. Make a good, that dancing. Go on out there and be somebody. I just hope they listen. Shit is ridiculous. You know, if you watch a movie, say you watch a movie and one character says that no character says, what's your number, man? What's the other character always say? 555, 5555. You know why we gotta do that? Because stupid ass people go to the movies and then go home and try to call the characters that they just saw. Hello, because there's any other gentlemen here? No motherfuckin' fake, it's not his number. And to be honest, this is the worst time in history to be a black celebrity. Fuck, they lockin' all our stars up. It's hot right now for black celebrities. I knew it was bad when Kobe got in trouble. I said, this is a rap fuss. He's one of the most wholesome dudes we had. Lockin' up everything. Kobe kept it together. Thank God he held his game together because if he was cracking under pressure and getting like six points of game, the whole LL would have been like, that nigger is guilty. Kobe was playing his ASO. He was playing like his freedom depended on that shit. You see that some motherfuckin' him game? This nigger's trying to beat that case on the court. I'm a star. Like the judge threw him in the ball like, play for your freedom. If I could talk to Kobe, I'd be just relaxed. You'll be fine, man, because the public is still giving Kobe the benefit of the doubt. He's one of the few black celebrities that get that. Not because he's a celebrity, more because, you know, the girl showed up with eight different savings to the investigation. You can't do that. That's seven too many. That's a lot of savings, man. That's seven too many. That's a lot of savings, man, because you got no one's arc on a pan is... I wish you're trying to recreate who man it is. She's a collector. She got every unsolved mystery the answer might be in this girl's pan. I had the first place I looked. OJ's other gloves in there. Bigfoot's footprint. Three CSI reruns in it, motherfucker. You got the most damn boggled draws ever. Fuck me in a celebrity. It's not the time to be a black star. They locking all our stars up. Black celebrities, this is the witch hunt for us, man. God damn it. It's all OJ's fault. Ever since OJ got away, why have people just been locking up our stars one by one? It's true. And it's all... It's not even OJ's fault. It's all fault. We celebrated too openly when OJ got acquitted. We should have been quiet about that shit. Susan Knock guilty. Nick was your name? Oh, and your face, Nick and your face. Perth's throwing at her. Burns, damn it. And good at justice system. Burns, damn it. Welcome to my world, motherfucker. All that shit. Why have people wanted OJ's ass, bad? City LA spent over $12 million just trying at motherfucker. And the look on white people's face when he was acquitted, priceless. Priceless. And that's why I don't trip all the banners to the evidence. I don't like it. I don't trust it. There's one minute they all love you. The next thing you know. In front of that courthouse dancing on top of a car, just trying to figure out the fuck happened to you. What was I waiting for? Because the time in this Michael Jackson shit is what makes me doubt it. Every time his war is going out of control, the economy gets bad or something is wrong with the world at large, it's always these moments in history that Michael Jackson will pay. Michael Jackson will coincidentally. Jericho Alphakeed is just getting ridiculous. Are you planning this shit? Do you have meetings? Michael, thank you for coming. As you know, Michael, the war has not been going as well as we expected. There's been a lot of hiccups and the public is asking us a lot of questions, of course, and. Well, Michael, there's no nice way to say this and I know how to do his beat directs. Let me just beat direct. We're going to need you to jerk off another child, Mike. I'm sorry. I am sorry. But it wouldn't really help out. Or maybe he did it. Who knows? Who knows? That's the thing. That's what I wanted to say. Who knows? Who the fuck knows? Mike, God, and this little boy known. That's about it. That's about it. The only reason that I can even talk about this shit is because everybody is speculating. They all think he did it. And I don't think he did it. I'm alone in this. I don't think he did it. I'm not going to say I don't think he did it. That's too strong. Let me just say I am a reserving judgment. Until all the facts come out. It was so far from what I heard. I mean, the kids said he's dying of cancer. He was in Make-A-Wish Foundation. He had two weeks to live. And it was his dying wish to meet Michael Jackson. Come on, man. Give me a fucking break. His kid is 10 years old. He don't remember Thriller. The fuck you want to meet Michael Jackson for, honestly. I remember Thriller. And I just like, kind of want to meet this nigga. I wouldn't break an appointment with him. I put it that way. I'd have to already be free. That's ridiculous. That's like if I'm dying in two weeks and go, I'm gonna get me in a room with Chubby Chaco. I wouldn't want to meet that man with the fuck on that. My last two weeks. Why not usher somebody like this? So then the kid claims he goes to Michael's house. This is where it all gets crazy. I don't like, you know, he does everything you'd expect at Michael's house. They climb trees and rode rollercoasters and Ferris wheels. The chef made cookies, pies, and cakes. They was petting them all here in the draft. Saying, songs, kids shit. And in the middle of all this chat like activity, for some reason, Mike pulled out some wine and some pills. And sucked this kid's dick. Folks, it hurts me to say it. And the kid had the nerve to call that abuse. The fuck of that is a good, host guy. What else do you want? What else do you want? I'm not gonna get a glass of rake drink in my friend's house. Alone with Rokos riding my dick sucked. Mike must be confused like I brought you in my house. I fed you. I sucked your dick. And this is how you repay me, motherfuckers. This was your wish, not man. Thought you were dying in two weeks. What happened to that, mother? I've been in court for a year and a half because strong every time I see you. This is fucked up. I shouldn't even say this fuck. Wouldn't be some ironic shit if they found out through this case that the cure for cancer was Michael Jackson sucking your dick sometimes. If Mike had powers like Green Mile and all the kids like, what's up guys? I never again. You need an appreciated. Can we at least study your saliva? Please, Mike. He's just done stop, though. This doesn't stop. And the only reason I can talk about Mike is because he's a freak. He's a freak. That's why people let you talk about it. I brought up Catholic priest fucking kids that don't get quiet as shit. But when Michael Jackson does it just okay because he's a freak. His face is all cut up. But just remember when you look at that thing that he calls his face, that he did that for you somehow. Somehow he thought maybe it'll help. Maybe people who like me more, if I turn myself into a white, I don't know what the fuck it is, but he did it for you. And I appreciate the gesture, Michael Jackson, if you're watching this, I appreciate that gesture. And I want you to know, fuck everybody, they should pale understands. Because you want to know something? I'm getting some work done. Surprise, yes. Nothing major. You would never know if I didn't tell you, but it's some shit I'm insecure about that I want to work on. If you must know, I'm getting boat talks done on my balls to get these wrinkles out. Finally, we have these just smoothest eggs. No, I can't wait. I cannot wait. And I'm not stopping there. That's just phase one, baby. You'll be like Bob Villa, these old balls. I'm fixing them up. I'm plucking all the hair out. I got to make room. I know this. I got to make room. I'm going to tattoo a gangster ass face on me and expressions like this. Then I wrote a hair back on the bottom so they got beard like me. Then I'm hitting that beach and looking for balls suckers. I'm going to wear some high shorts just like this. And walk up the women with a confidence I've never had before. Pardon me, Miss. I don't mean to be rude. But do you suck balls? Excuse me. Miss relax. You didn't even let me finish. Do you suck these balls? Oh my god, those balls are as smooth as eggs. Yes, I'll suck them. I played this scenario out in my man, a million times lady. That's how it always ends. Yes, I'll suck those balls. All our stars. All our stars, man. Our Kelly pissed on his victim. I know, it was rough. But I mean, again, I can't even judge our Kelly. First of all, we don't know these allegations are true. If you want to know how I feel about it, honestly, if a man cannot pee on his fans, I don't want to be in show business anymore. Well, that's why I got in the game. Baby, I got dreams too. You guys are confusing the issue. Why you guys are busy worrying about if our Kelly even peed on this girl and I? You're not asking yourself the real question. That American needs to decide once and for all. And the only thing is how old is 15 really? Oh, that's a good question. That's a good question. I'm not saying that a person is as smart as they're going to be at 15. That's not what I'm saying, man. But I am saying 15 to me is old enough to decide whether or not you want to be pissed on. I mean, that's me. If you can't make a decision like that by the time you're 15, then just give up motherfucker because life is way harder than that. I make tougher decisions all the time. If you don't want to get pissed, then I want to just get the fuck out of the way. It's not even a decision. If I start peeing on the front row, they're not going to have to calculate and think, how do I feel about this? Am I okay with it? They just move. You can do that at 15. I could have. I bet 15. When I was 15, I was doing stand-up in night clubs. I smoked a rafel from time to time. Friends were selling crack. I was trying to finger fuck people. I knew what was happening around me to some degree. Getting pissed on was the least of my worries at 15. Trust me. But it keeps coming up. It's a lot of confusion around that age. Anytime 15 comes up, people freak out. Like when that girl Elizabeth Smart got kidnapped. Right? Remember when you told last year's 15-year-old girl Elizabeth Smart was kidnapped? And then they finally found her and the whole country was relieved. And I was the only one saying damn. She wasn't that smart after all. Not because she got kidnapped. That could happen to anybody. I'm not going to for that. I'm just saying if you kidnapped me when I was 15, you got to take me further than eight miles away from my house. Man, God damn. Can't hold me prison around. Shit, I recognize. I'll break away. I'll break away. Fuck off me. That's my bus stop. I know I'm mad. I'm going home. She was missing for six months, eight miles away from my house. That's two exits, man. That's nothing. And while she was missing during this half a year that this girl was missing, there's a seven-year-old black girl who gets kidnapped and fill a delphy. Nobody knows her name. They might have talked about it two or three times on the news, but she should have been the top store. Because she chewed through the ropes and had both of these motherfuckers in jail. And 45 minutes flat. Seven years old. I'm not making this up. There's two crack heads kidnapped and took them back to the crack house and tied her up. And then they left her. There's a crack heads. I got to make moves, crack smoke, chocolate, eat. These motherfuckers made moves. It was out. But as soon as they left, this little girl got the nibbun. She was kidnapped at four o'clock and at home watching herself on news at 5.30. That shit is crazy. That's a news store. That is a news store. Now, meanwhile in Utah, 15-year-old Elizabeth's smarts captors left her alone too. And they didn't even tie her up because they're here at Bill East. They just bounced. Don't try to escape, bitch, or will kill you. Be right back. I believe she's 15 sitting in the house by herself. Oh, am I going to get out of this? Come on, Elizabeth, think. Think Elizabeth, how am I going to get out of here? Why don't you just open the fucking door and go outside? Have you thought about that? Do you have a quarter? Do you know your phone number? Your 15-bitch run? Stop thinking and stop making moves. I know I sound mean. I don't know what the people are thinking when I'm saying this. Dave, she's only 15. All right. But that's the discrepancy because when you talk about a little girl like Elizabeth's smart, then the country feels like 15 is so young and so innocent. On the flip side, here comes 15 again. Now we talk about a 15-year-old black kid in Florida. This black kid accidentally killed his neighbor when he's practicing wrestling moves that he's on TV. Now, was he a kid? Oh, they gave him life. They always try 15-year-olds as adults. There's no one he was doing. It's a goddamn pile driver. This kid gets on the ropes. There's no stopping him. You'd have to send a rock to a restaurant. And they gave him 15-year-old boy, Life and Jail. If you think that it's okay to give him life and jail, then it should be legal to pee on him. That's all I'm saying. You got to make up your mind across the board. How old 15 actually is? That's all I'm saying. So I'm going to tell you right now, if somebody comes in here and puts a gun in my head, and says, Shapali, you got a choice to make. You're either going to jail for a month or we'll let you go, but you got to let R. Kelly pee on you. I'm not hesitating. Bring in R. Kelly and tell him to stay away from my ass. I'd rather get pissed on on the outside and fucking the butt on the insats. I can't go to jail with some smooth Botox balls and think everything's going to be all right. It's not that kind of place. Taking my chance with that pissed a wash off with a 10-minute shower, I'm certain of it. This piss is coming right out. What can I do? They're going to put me in jail. Sad is changing rapidly. Can't smoke indoors. The fuck was that all about? I got kicked out of titty-buff smoke. No, that shit was ridiculous. It's the stripper did it. The stripper came up like, you're smoking as a health risk for me. I don't want to work on this kind of environment. Spitchy have your gunnery and fussy pussy in my face. You started it. They threw me out. It's the dirtiest place I've ever been thrown out of and just a given idea of what I mean by dirty. Lap dances at this place. Three dollars. It's fucking disgusting. And at the same time, who could pass up a sale? Son, it was three dollars. Of course I did it. Only 12 quarters. Said I'll break a fire for that. I've never seen somebody work this hot for three dollars. This lady must have been a throwback to the Great Depression. She was all over me. It's the first time I ever told a stripper to get off me. All right. Yeah, thank you very much, miss. Thank you. That'll be all. That's enough thinking. Hey! Hey, get off of me! Whatever happened to lipstick on the collar lady? I have a shit streak on the middle of my shirt. How the fuck am I going to explain this when I get home? Huh? Oh no, baby. Me and Bob were playing basketball and Bob Dunk on me was hanging on the rim and his pants fell down. I was checking them clothes. I think he was swinging. And his butt cheeks might, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, his butt cheeks, I think, caught my shirt. I don't know why I was playing ball in my dress shirt. It was midnight. I don't know what the fuck. Just let me think. That's what, that's what you know guys, Slian, if you say shit like that. Hold on, just let me think. We may not have stayed at Teeve. Hold on, that's just a methane farm, man. Can I think? Can I think? We all win, man. You guys, you guys, you guys just made too much progress, too fast. Not too much, but you just, you confused by, you made so much progress, you even confused. Man, I ain't women. We both, like, what the fuck just happened? Because women got all of this money now, but they still like women. Like, oh, you never take me anywhere anymore. And it do be thinking, bitch, you got more money than me. You never take me anywhere anymore. And at the same time, you don't treat a man like a man. You don't cook. You don't clean. And you don't do anything, or motherfuckers say it. You tell them motherfuckers what, do I see women doing this to men all the time? Come on! Oh, man, what's that shit? So, when anybody that tells me what to do that much, you got to work with me. Like, if it makes a man feel like a man to watch the game, then just let them sit down and watch the game for a minute. And if he happens to look over it, she won't be watching the game. Don't look at him all mean and make him feel guilty about watching it. Just pick up your own titties and suck it. Just try it out. He will instantly remember why he fell in love. Oh, that's right. So, that night, girl sucks on own titties from time to time. I can't walk away from that. It's too hard to find. You see that, took 20 seconds. You're still gonna be as busy as you want. Just suck your own titties and everything's cool. Well, how about this? If you make a love to your man, you already make a love. My husband will spice it up, right? How about this? I personally like it. I like it when a girl tells me where to come. I don't like it when a girl tells me when to come. I hate that shit. Don't come here. Oh, bitch, all these rules! And instead of doing that, why don't you just tell us where? It's make us feel better, especially if you're aggressive about it. I like when a girl gets wow. Come in my face! Stick your chin out like a boxer. Bring it on, motherfucker! There are a bomb! But it doesn't have to be that wild or explicit. That's a... Look, all the maintenance in those that you're interested in that you participate. You can say anything, he'll be happy. Oh, oh, oh. Come on top of the television. All right, but... The weirder, the place is better. Oh, come in my fishbowl. Damn, fishbowl. Oh, shit, the eatin' it all! Fish love it when I come over. Oh, is that guy we're having chicken tonight? You guys, man, thanks, man. It's been the best year of my career. By fall. I appreciate you guys watching me. Can I do for my kids, brother? And my kids off the hook. You can think I'm a bad motherfucker. Wait till you see the 2000 model, should I peel this? Nega is off the hook! I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. The hook! My son's a bad! My oldest son is three. Nega made me a necklace out of macaroni. I said, this shit is a baller. He painted the macaroni green and put it on a string. He tied it on my neck and he told me he was proud of me. And I got choked up. And he thought I was sad. It's how smart he was. He says, like, you say it, Daddy. And I said, no. I'm not sad. He's too young to understand his son. But this is fuckin' crazy. You used to live in my balls, man. Now you making jewelry out of macaroni or bad motherfucker. Long live Chappell's. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Oh, shit. Thanks, guys. Thank you. That's what it's all about. Everybody usually wants to be famous so they can rock nice jewelry on that shit. They already got them macaroni necklace. I got valuable shit. I got valuable shit. I got valuable shit. Not in it for that. Only kind of shit I want to do with fame is like decadent as I want to go to Vegas to the $5,000 blackjack tape. And I don't even want to play. I just want to be such a big star that I could go up to one of the players in a tight hand and put my dick on this show. And I'm such a celebrity. They think it's funny. Hey, what the fuck? Oh, shit. Dave Chappell. God. Get on the cell phone. You are not going to believe whose dick is on my shoulder. And this guy's balls are smooth as eggs. He's had some work. Couldn't thank you enough. That bless you, old man. Keep watching. I'm going to try to make it interesting. Stay safe. I'm rich, bitch.

I'm fat like that. I'm growing like that. And first of all, I said, give Capri around applause. And... My fucka blew up, didn't he? He's arrogant now. I said, hello, Capri. I'll see you on the set. You've changed, man. What is that record, though, man? What is it? I'm fat like that. I'm cool like that. Or you know that. He know that. I'm a planet. I'm cool like that. I'm rat like that. I'm fat. What the fuck are they talking about? I'm gonna fucking make an album or anything. I got huge like that. I got shit on my mind like that. I'm just tripping like that. I stink like that. I fucking like that. And it shit's selling. I go back to the old days with the rappers. I'm gonna, you know, I'm into that shit, man. Because you're going to support them, support them always. Because these brothers working hard, they get staying out the street. Nah, because you know, I was in Atlanta. You know, and I saw MoD. Remember a couple of years ago, MoD was the shit. How you like me now? So I'm in Atlanta with a crisscross jacket on. Confused like a motherfucker, dude. I'm still gonna lose my hand. I will continue to support these brothers, y'all. I'm telling ya, I must be doing well. I'm at Micah Jackson. He wanted to meet me. Ya'll. That shit tripped me out. You know, I was like, airy brother in this motherfucker. I was like, you know, cause I thought I'll never meet Micah Jackson. You know, I was like, fuck, don't give fucking more, I mean, he was bad when he was doing ABC and all that shit, you know, but fuck him over there, and that.

infection it causes disease and cramps he goes dude I got kids help me it's going to feel different so I give him one I see him later he's cramped always like I hurt my neck in high school and this is why sometimes if you see me on Ellen or something I'm sitting kind of funny or I sit on my knees I just cannot sit in a couch it kills me I was in high school in a talent show how when I was a kid you know like I was a senior senioritis and I did this talent show and I did a dance number to match a man and at the end of the dance number I would do a backflip a standing back flip I could do it because I was in gymnastics and there's a few red flags in the story but we're not gonna focus on that we're just gonna sort of skim over the top so I'm backstage at the show at the talent show and it was held like in a place like this in the cafeteria where we had our major shit you know at the school and my buddy was in his crotty ghee also in matcha man and I go hey spot me during my backflip something to practice and then I go you know what don't spot me I have to do it in an hour so his job is nothing just watch the disaster unfold so I go like this hi and I'm supposed to land like this but I came out of my tuck lingo a little early and I miss my feet so I went poof all on my face so I bounce up on my oh squirting blood black paint from the stage and I get up and the guy goes you okay I go not at all and I walk away one knee black out I lose my memory for a solid hour like hardcore amnesia and they get like you know by the way when you're a kid and you get hurt in my family there's sort of an unwritten rule and unspoken you don't say anything like you're not allowed to get hurt you know I mean I don't know if we had insurance we didn't but around our house don't get hurt policy unless it's from the parents you know I mean because there was sort of a you're fine you know situation like anything you're fine I go my side feels like you're fine I go oh but the bone is sticking out you're fine little back teen back teen was literally air and the parents are like shoe we took care of that I'm like still a little painful because the bone so I knew that so I'm like going out going oh no I'm this is uncool and then they brought my mom back in a doctor from the house and the doctor goes he's a bit shook up and I go is that all you have are you from guns smoke you're not saying anything this isn't a term I have a category 200 concussion I have amnesia dude all right if I was in the NFL right now they would stop the game and chopper me out of there it would literally all the other on their knees like this you know the whole team and then even the other team is like faking it like oh man are you okay two pairs and I rest so the doctor's like nice bit rattled yeah he got his bell wrong these aren't things all right these aren't medical terms and then he goes you better take him right to the emergency room my mom's like oh my god of course so she goes Davie do you want to go to hospital or pizza hot oh my god pizza how they had asteroids never went to the hospital never got looked at jaw and then if you ever see me on like a letterman and I got pukeshell necklace it's all percussed I'm like oh you don't know when you're a kid if your family has any money because everything's fun when you're a kid like you don't you're told later you know like I guess we were brought I didn't know everything's you know you play with rocks whatever I knew I broke as I had a rock collection I look back rocks are free I didn't really you know put that together mom's like you should collect bottle caps it wasn't gold bars you know if you're a kid and you don't know if you have money like you don't even talk about it but we were poor and I didn't know I one time in fourth grade this kid busted this shit wide open he just walks up I'm gonna play around just chilling like over by the fence you know there's kickball and I'm literally minding my own biz and this kid comes over he goes hey I heard your family's poor I'm like by the way news to me and I go oh I think you've got some bad information by the way P.S. wanted dick you know because all the chicks are starting like like not really the panty dropper you wanted to be even in third grade like so I go uh no we're doing fine even though I don't know so they guy goes yeah it's a swear on campus your poor and I go oh then I start defending myself ah what do we have two tires on our lawn if we were poor yes I go no no you don't get it we have a car with the four tires and then we have two extra on the lawn you see how you broke I go what I wear the same thing every day I'm just hearing myself saying it going if I was poor and I remember my mom going where that again tomorrow you look great in it like such a scam the high ones and one more bamboozled by my own mom even crayons at school like in third you remember having that little ghetto four pack you get an eye-op if she swiped them here's your crayons for the year these four from cocos he's like like the ones we had yesterday yeah they they're very similar so I bring him to school like I'm Kingcock and I'm over there and this girl next to me is cute and the guy behind me is rich I guess for then and he had the big box of crayolas like 64 like the mega pack can't get anymore in there crammed in I've got my little four and I'm like and then this chick goes hey uh can I borrow a crayon I'm like why sure she goes do you have Bert Sienna and I go let me check got brown blue red and the guy's like I have Bert Sienna here you go up let me sharpen it on the box like a prick there's like here you go you know if you do blue and black together it's sort of a brush I'm good beret I saw the 99 cents throw on the way in here I almost went in because my show is not right now I was gonna check it out and then I held out a mile later 98 cents store yeah bring it home not to be a snob I just don't know what's in those stores because I don't know what cost that much you know what I mean because I go where they're thumbtacks and yarn what you know it's a whole store full everything and the only thing I thought was weird was the home pregnancy test this for the girl in the regular pharmacy going you know I want to find out if I'm pregnant but I'm not spending more than a buck to find out I'll just wait this will sort of figure itself out you know when you're crossing the street out here in L.A. you have the right of way when you cross the street the cars have to stop and it's always weird because it's sort of a power trip you know no one uses across walk everyone's like this hey that was a great lunch maybe later on when I cross I give the courtesy fake jog they're like just walks are you actually going slower I don't like people have too much safety in the protection the right away this woman's pushing her baby in the stroller but she's texting so she's sort of poking the kid out like a stick you know see what's happening out there and I'm pulling up and I know I'm supposed to stop but I'm texting too you know what I mean and I want to that's the idea it's just not a perfect science you know it usually works out and somehow as I go over that bulls-ent literally am I in a car like let's go to the movie like I'm on the street it's scary there's times and it's real touch and go people go you're on TV your movies it looks easy is it easy to act yes I mean yes it's not hard I mean obviously obviously people can do it it's not like other things this might be the easiest because you always hear about people doing it doing well I mean the Oscars this is the hardest thing you can do in acting the best of the best award of all actors right Jody Foster when I was growing up five years old she won an Oscar right her first movie Gabrielle Cibadee winner she is he was in precious never done a movie up for an Oscar last year beast of the southern wild five year old girl first movie up for an Oscar Jennifer Hudson American Idol gets eighth place on American Idol she can't win in the field she is trained her whole life for singing waltzes over to acting wins an Oscar her first try what's wrong with this it's like me hey I want to play the NBA oh you can't do that that doesn't look that hard I'm the MVP the first year you're better than LeBron I guess they just put in the hoop I didn't seem hard yeah embarrassing embarrassing for all of sad I was a little unnerved the other dicks my phone died and I didn't have my phone for a day it was nice now emails no stress no texting relaxing I'm getting I hated it it was so horrible I freaked out I couldn't survive I was having a panic attack and it wasn't even it was two hours it wasn't a day just so long as I could get to the store but meanwhile by the way I'm driving and I'm like I don't think I even know how to drive without texting I'm like what do I do like just drive and look at shit oh my god there's trees on my street it's so weird and a blackberry which sucks you know doesn't mean just like the Flintstones I liked it but you just got to move on with the iPhone you know and it's the part I didn't know is it tries to finish your sentences you know this where it's like jumps ahead a little bit and I was with a girl and it went all sideways on me and so the next day I said hey sorry for my bad form and it said sorry for my tiny weiner come on I funny your mind seemed like but then the guy said I take so many of these pictures you know like that it learns it's not their fault I get it by the way you're taking these pictures be careful guys because unless you're Chris Brown and you have this huge hog I like when Chris Brown's pictures get leaked out to the media oh my god I'm so bummed out my huge donkey dick is out on the internet like really are you really sweating bullets over this one I have a picture that was obviously your 15th selfie dude dude just the balls oh my god someone broke into my laptop and then they're on the internet really by the way dude how hard is that I can't even get in my own laptop half the time that's like password what's my password it's so funny I go I'm supposed to believe someone stole your laptop from the airport ran home crack the code found your weiner pictures and then set it to your 10 favorite websites and you put out a press release in a half hour really like oh my god please don't look at my dick pics here's the link and you know it's leaked because you never see an actor with a tiny weiner get those pictures leaked you know then you'd see some scrambling in Hollywood shut down the internet the whole internet huh it's figured this out let me think and if girls ever gift you with a dirty picture don't ignore it that's such a mistake answer quickly you don't wait nine hours then you get another text from her hey uh buddy chance did you get that picture of my pussy ah oh yeah no I did that was cool you did do that you're eating oh yeah no great send some more no no no more if you get a girl dinner you know she's kind of a run around sue is my mom's if you go hey send me a picture she's like um okay and then you get like some stock footage of her beaver from August you know this is you right now aren't you a cheesecake factory she's like no I'm in the bath there's a lot of candles it looks like so messy I date these girls and this is the biggest thing I get I never date really good looking guys I've always gone out with guys like you I go and they don't stop no no what I mean is everybody likes Johnny that Brad Pitt

it all week I tell my friends I can't sleep it's always on my mind I like yours I can relax I don't feel a thing I can sort of figure out my week in my head I can text people it never crosses my mind again I never tell anyone about it I forget about it until the next time we have sex I go that's cool that's that's good that's good quality other than your girl and you have sex with a guy don't ever go you don't want a big dick I've had that unprovoked hey wait let me ask you motherfucker all right you don't fuck that yours is fine it's like slow motion it's fine who wants fine guys like you know what it does a jab when you're a swimmer you touch the wall and come back that's enough that's all you need why do you need more I go because it's great don't drink and drive folks that's the big message tonight there's a there's a DUI lawyer commercial I I don't work in the day the show's not on home all day first of all every add is geared toward the fact that you are a loser at home in search of a career I didn't know that like every add is you at home right now laying around hungover weed on the table you want to change all that I think maybe I could go to drive they say it's not

checkpoints are bad when you're drunk I mean one time I drank and drove drove and drive one time and it was a mistake but I was horrified because I was in traffic at 3 a.m. on sunset which usually doesn't happen so I'm almost home like and then it's traffic and I'm always selfish in traffic I'm like they're better be an accident up here they better be a pile of dead bodies what's happening this

back it up I'm boxed in go go go hey if we work together as a team we can get me out of here to save me come on no one's helping me and then I do the U-turn you know what a U-turn is a sign confession

oh this is music to my dad because he was a super drunk you know what I mean we'd come home from dinner and he's like there we go he's hitting dogs and mailbox is like anything in his way and then and it's a different conversation cop walks up hey did you know oh my god I didn't know you were a shit face I'm sorry I was like yeah beat it mom no I thought you're even a seizure you're just hitting so

 I still remember when I first decided I wanted to do comedy. I just graduated college and I remember telling my mom who's from Compton, very hardened by the world. I remember telling her I wanted to do comedy. She goes, why? And I go, because I've never felt better than when I could bring different people together. And I remember her just going, oh baby, that's the softest shit I've ever heard. I was like, oh cool. Great. I want to go home. Thank you. Seriously, thank you. How sweet was that? Jesus Christ. I didn't know how weird it was to tell people I was from Florida until I moved. We got a reputation, y'all, it's bad. You know what I'm saying? Because we're a weird place, like, let's be honest. Florida is like the Kanye of the 50 states. Like, let's be honest, you know? It's like when I was young, I loved it, but the older I get, the more I'm like, I mean, I don't know if I can defend everything it's doing. You feel where I'm coming from? Florida and Kanye just have so many similarities when it comes to like, how hard they are to root for. Does that make sense? It's like, yeah, they're both creative. They both love women with big booties, but they both try to make the Confederate flag cool. It's like, ah, mistakes were made. It's tough thing to defend. That's all I'm getting at. I still get defensive for Florida. When I'm on the road, I actually do. I get defensive all the time. I just don't like when people try to make it sound like all the crazy shit in the country only happens here. I'm like, get the fuck out of here with that. Let's stuff acting like you haven't been in your hometown and you're walking down the street and you saw some dude that made you go, oh, Jesus Christ, boy, that fucking guy. Oh, my God. Was his dick sticking out his back pocket? Jesus, you saw that, right? It's just crazy to me. And then people try to cite Florida man stories as if that's the end all be all. Get the fuck out of here. They're like, what about Florida man? I hate that they say it as if all the other people in Florida aren't reading it, thinking the exact same shit as that. I'm like, what about Florida man? I'm like, what about that nigga? He's crazy. What about Florida man? He's out of his mind. I agree with you. It's so weird that they bring that up. You know what I mean? Because I just, what's the easiest way to explain this? It's just with Florida man stories, they don't make sense to me because they make it sound like, like, what do they think we're thinking as we read it? Like we're not relating. Like none of us are reading the Florida man story. All these crimes are going nice. He finally did it. Oh shit. Oh, yeah. Dude, follow your dreams, baby. Jerry always said he wanted to throw an alligator through a drive-through window. And they told him he couldn't do it, but he persevered. So ridiculous man. And then you'll hear people say, like, these dumb arguments, they'll be like, well, if our states are so crazy, why don't we hear as much about us? I asked a prosecutor. I'll tell you what. Did you know that everything that goes to court in this country is public record? Anything that goes to court, you can look it up if you know how. But, and this is what I didn't know, every state uses a different site. And it just so happens according to this prosecutor, Florida has one of the easiest sites to search public records for, even if you have no experience looking up public records. So you could do like a keyword search. You could go, meth, eat, face. A case in Florida is going to show up. But you could do that exact same search in another state. The case exists and it doesn't show up unless you know how to pry deeper to make it come out. Do you understand what I'm saying? The other states aren't less crazy. They're just better at keeping secrets. That's all it is. They're Bruce Jenner. We're Caitlin. That's it. That's literally all we're talking about here. And I just don't like when they try to make it sound like it's only here. Have you read your news? I have. I've checked your sites and you've got some shit going down. Have you seen this guy in Colorado who tricked out his bulldozer into a tank and he drove it through the houses and the businesses of everyone he thought wouldn't support his muffler store? You want to talk about Colorado, man? You see this guy in Massachusetts literally living in the walls of somebody else's house would only come out at night to pretend to be the ghost of the dead mother of the two little girls that live there. We don't want to shout out. I'm like, Massachusetts guy. That's all I'm saying. I'm not saying if you're from another state, you're a bad person, but stop acting like it only happens in Florida. People are fucking dogs where you live too. That's a weird point to rally a crowd around here. Oh my God, dude. It does feel good to be back, man. There's people everywhere though. Be real. They don't hide behind the state lines. They're like, no, we're everywhere. You see the story about this cop in St. Louis? Cop in St. Louis sued his own precinct because his boss told him on the clock, by the way, tone down your gayness. That is a direct quote. Tone down your gayness. His boss said to him with an HR department, are you out of your fucking mind? But that was a direct quote. That's what he told him. Cop sues the department. He wins the case as he should, by the way. You know unless he was awarded? $19 million. You hear what I just heard? I can tell you what I just heard. I have not been acting gay enough at my work. $19 million, you said I will do some almost gay things. For $19 million, if I was like, cop, you wouldn't even have to ask. I'll put rhinestones on my handcuffs. I don't give a shit. I'll do whatever I got to do. I'll start mason everybody with bathroom body works. What's the thing? What do I got to do? Everybody I bring to the precinct smells like apricot. I don't care. I'll get you Miranda right to wrong. I'll be like, you got the right to remain steamy. It's $19 million. You're not going to do whatever it tastes. I'll chase the siren of my cop car to a Ariana Grande song. I don't give a damn. You saw me chasing you down the street. You just hear bang, bang, hands on the roof. Like I'm going to go, fuck. What are we talking about? It's $19 million. I'll spit on my night stick before I use it. I'll be like, what seems to be the problem here? I'm just saying that's a lot of money. I'm not gay or cop. I want to be both of those things. Crazy people everywhere. That's the only point I'm trying to make here. I don't like how people try to make Florida sound. Like I live in LA now. I've been there for five years. The number one question I get asked when I tell people I'm from Florida. They go, oh, you're from one of the messed up schools with a teacher's of fucking the students? I'm like, wow. What? Fucking the students. I mean, yeah. Twice. And they're like, that's funny to you. And I go, it depends on the situation. And they're like, when's a teacher sleeping with a student ever funny? And I'm like seventh grade. Seven grade, it's real funny, man. I'll tell you real story. You can look it up on our site. When I was in seventh grade, we had a female teacher who slept with a male student. That's true. Class she taught, hardest math class we offered in the program. Student she slept with? Smartest kid in the class. When the rest of us students found out what she did, none of us were like, how could she do this? We were all like, fuck, we should have studied harder. Oh, you're telling me that's who was at stake the whole time? Understand the point I'm trying to make here. I'm not saying teachers should be sleeping with students. I'm saying I've never been more motivated to learn. You feel fresh? She's giving out Felatio for ratios. You think I'm not going to learn this material? Probably studied for that class. I was in eight mile. I'm like, you only get one shot. You not miss your chance to. You think I know Pythagorean theorem? Because I care with the hypotenuse of a right triangle. You better grow up. I was trying to lay teenage hype. Can I say some wild shit? Hear me out for a second. I'm just saying, if we were more open-minded, we might have more kids that were caring about their education. You know what I mean? But when I will not do what it takes. If you fail a class, of course, you get summer school. But if you ace a class, come on. Homer school, what do you think? Felas, you're not intrigued. I know this doesn't work for you. But Felas, you're not intrigued a little bit. If a blowjob is waiting for you at the end of it, you would have paid a little more attention in geometry. That's all I'm getting at here. You can turn the whole game. You're like, what's your cool? I love the dynamic there. Nerds are cool now. Imagine you walking down the hallways. You got point-dexter glasses on, pocket protector. Buccane calculator watch. All the jocks are staring at you. Damn, she'll be getting all the blowjob's man. He's crazy, though. I keep trying to learn algebra, but my dad keeps making me practice quarterback. The fucking dork. Right? This is just so cool to take in. It's a safe, fine. I just want to live in it a little bit. I've written article a while back. Always stuck with me. This company did a study where they said only 30% of people in this country actually get to do their dream job. Did you know that? Only 30% of people in this entire country get to do their dream job. When I think about that and I see that y'all came out, I'm just grateful y'all came to support my backup plan, y'all. This was not my dream job. Don't get around. My career's going great. I'm happy. But this ain't what I dream. Get the fuck out of here. I never dreamed of telling people how gay I'd get for $19 million. Yeah, yeah. I wasn't a kid just staring at the stars one day. They're going to know the price. But I was going to the NBA. The NBA. The NBA they had another thoughts. I still remember when I fell in love with basketball. I remember the day. I was like, I'm going to do this. Five years old. Five, never heard a basketball. No one had ever introduced me to it. I get taken to a game. We get to sit close. I mean, close. Like, close enough to like, you get to see the game that you don't get to see on TV. You know what I'm saying? I still remember this is Clear's Day, right? I saw Player A, foul player B, heart. And then I saw a ref call a foul on Player A. And then I saw Player A turn to the ref and go, I suck my dick and I was like, what game is this? What is this? A five years old, my mind's blown. I'm like, you can do that. I remember I look at the guy sitting next to me. I go like, he just said the thing. Is he not going to get in trouble for that? And the guy next to me goes, nah, he's going to be fine. I'm like, what game is this? I want to do this when I grow up. What is this? The NBA might be the wildest workplace in America. We don't even talk about it. Think about what you've seen them get to do. Cross-reference it with your job. Tell me their equals. Get the fuck out of here. I just saw a guy tell a coworker suck my dick and everybody who saw it went, you know, hey, yes. What? What a free workplace. And I'm just saying, there's something to it. The NBA is just a place where you could just sort of get away with almost anything. And I'm not saying it's always got to be bad. You could just sort of do anything. It's got a place there. When I was growing up, there was a player named Jason Terry, his nickname was the jet. And anytime Jason Terry hit a three-point, and you know how he'd celebrate? He'd spread his arms. Like, they were the wings on a plane. And he would just run back down court as if he had flown away. He did that for 19 years. I need you to prompt 19 years of a guy running through the office. Aaaaah! Nobody stopped him. Now once, nobody was like, Jason, what the fuck are you flying? They could get back on defense. We're still playing. Not once for two decades. God, I want to do that so bad. I just love the idea that he got to do that for fucking 19 years. Oh, oh. It's all I've ever wanted to do. You can't do that shit in comedy. I couldn't drop a punchline and be like, later, you know what I'm gonna be like, what the fuck are you doing? It's all I ever dream of doing. I just want to tell somebody to suck my dick and fly away. That's all I've ever wanted. I want it for everybody. I tried. I tried. Dude, I tried to get to the league, man. I tried so hard. I really thought I was going to the NBA. Closer as I got was a white girlfriend. I wasn't really. I remember the scouts were like, that's a good start. Now, next, we want you to stop this guy from scoring. I'm like, I'll try, but I'm better at the first thing. Get up, y'all. Let's gaze this for a second before I add. By round of applause, how many people here have ever dated somebody of another race before? Who's done it? Yeah. Okay. That's supposed to be. All right. But you're not a villain if you haven't. This isn't going to be one of those things. I'm just trying to gaze this before I ask, all right? For those of you that have dated somebody of another race, you've never gone out with that person and then you ran into somebody who just assumed that's all you're into. But you get what I'm saying with it like, oh, you got a thing? You're like, oh, I didn't know I had a thing. I run into it all the time. It's one of the biggest things in my day in life. People are always just like, JB. Yeah, JB only likes white girls. I'm like, that's not even true. I do like white girls, but I like women of every race and then they'll get defensive. They're like, well, then why have your last six girlfriends been white? And I'm like, because that's who said yes. So I can do. It's like, what Marty will want for me? What am I supposed to date six black women that said no, we've got our Kelly. What am I supposed to do? You feel me? Sorry, I'm not the king of R&B. I just don't understand why you getting mad at me, man. All I can do is shine the bat signal. I don't control who shows up. This is how I played out. But I'm from this out. I still don't understand for the love of me. I don't understand how in this day and age, people still have an issue with interracial dating. Like, sure, plenty of people don't. But you know who I'm talking about. Plenty of people still do. And it blows my mind that that's still a thing. What's wrong? I can't even imagine. What's wrong with two cultures coming together? You know what I mean? It's like, teach me about health insurance. I'll teach you how to duggy. Like, who's losing? Who's losing? Like, I don't even understand the logic of it. What's wrong with mixed kids? Mix kids are just white kids that don't sunburn. It's going to be all right. It's just black kids that go to supercuts. You're going to outgrow it. My guy ain't going to. You're going to overcome. I just don't understand why we can't have a more honest and open conversation about interracial dating and why it's not a threat to anybody. It's so bizarre to me, you know? Like, I still think about, listen, man, if I had a baby with a woman of any race, I would love that baby to death. To death. But if I'm being honest with you, if I had a baby with a woman of another race, I would still be really fucking excited in the way I could be excited about that. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm living it up. I'm taking advantage. Bro, I'm naming that motherfucker blade. I'm calling him day walker. I'm doing all the things. Bro, I'm picking him up off the operating table. All of their strengths. None of their weaknesses. Like, I'm living it up. It's all love. But I'm basking in what it is. You know what else could I do it? It's just so weird when people try to confront you for dating someone who doesn't look like you. It's like, how is this even an issue? It's even more weird when it's your own people. It's like, how are you who I'm arguing with? I'll give you a story. A long time ago, this is years ago when I lived in Tampa. I remember I went to a mall with my girlfriend at the time, right? My girlfriend was white. And she was my girlfriend is still white, to be clear. It sounded weird in my head. I'm pretty sure she's still doing the white thing. So we're at the mall, right? I remember she saw something in a display case that she wanted to check out. She goes to check it out. I don't go with her, right? I kind of just hang back. I just do a general scan of the room. I'm just checking out where I'm at. You ever just look at, what's the best way to check out? You ever just look around in the room, you're hanging out? You're just checking out? You ever accidentally make eye contact with a stranger? Like, you ever hold each other hostage? You know what I mean? You're just like, why? Well, we look away. What are our motives? You know, you're just caught in that moment? I lock eyes with this black dude. And the only way I can think to describe him is too excited to see me. That's the only way I can think. He's because of what he did. This is what he did, right? We lock eyes. And as soon as we lock eyes, he goes, what the fuck is that? The fuck is that gesture? Who do you do that? Not a stranger? You don't do that to a stranger? Who was that for? Like, you know, you do that when you catch Michelle Obama at the strip club. You're like, no, no, no. You feel me? But not me, you ran them black man across the way. But that's what he did. And I just go like, OK, all right, you won that contest. I'm not going to really be staring at you any longer. And I wait a couple of seconds. I peek out the side of my eye. And I'm like, oh, shit, he's coming. All right. This dude is coming to me. Walks up to me. This dude said one of the most confusing things I've ever heard in my life. To this day, I'm so curious to see what you think of it. This guy walks up to me. I swear to God, so kind of, he goes, hey, brother, I ain't trying to start nothing. But you know when we see you out here having social intercourse with all these other races, you look racist. And I went social intercourse. Have y'all ever heard that term? I had never heard social intercourse? That's an aggressive way to say hangin' with friends, isn't it? I didn't know hanging with buddies could sound so sexual. I didn't know I was such a heart-throb in the social community, yeah. Apparently, I lost my sexual virginity when I was 17, but I busted my first social note when I was like four. I had no idea there was such a difference. So I go social intercourse. That's a weird word, man. He goes, call it what you want, what you're doing is racist. And I go, racist? And he goes, yeah. And I go, let me get this straight. It's racist for me to be out in public with somebody of another race. And he goes, mm-hmm. And I went, you got to give me a sec, man. I never heard somebody be this wrong before. It was like 2012. I'm like, who hasn't seen, remember the Titans by now, my guy? How are we struggling with this? But he doubles down. This is why I never forgot it. He goes, no, what you need to understand is when we see you walk it in public with somebody of another race, it looks like you're embarrassed to be black. And I was like, what kind of mind fuck is this, my guy? Did that make sense to any of y'all? Okay, because the damn shit didn't make sense to me. I'm gonna talk about it. I just wanna make sure we're on the same page before I get far. Let me say a couple things. Nobody of another race has the power to make you feel embarrassed of your own race. Let me make that very clear. You feel about you the way that you feel about you. You know what's wild though? You know who does have the power to make you feel embarrassed of your own race? People in your own race. Isn't it wild how accurate that is? We've all got representatives that made us go, no the fuck you don't speak for me, the fuck out here with that. What? We've all got those. You ever heard Kanye? Are you always relating or you're like, what the fuck he just said? Remember when he said slavery was a choice? Do you remember how many black people came to his rescue? Me neither. That's my point, dude. We cut that thing off like he, like subway to Jared, but you do remember how we handled it. We were like, he did what? Did we just prove? Oh no, no, no, no, no. The actions of this individual do not reflect. We cut him right out. Can I give you an example for white people? I can't speak for you. I'm just throwing it out there. I think this is a great one. Let's see how you do. Remember when George W. Bush was president? Remember that? Remember when we did that interview. He said this verbatim. He goes. Shame on. Shame on you. You fool me. Can't get fooled again. That's a direct quote. That's a direct quote. I had to Google that to make sure I got it right how wrong he said it. And all I'm saying is if you're a George W. supporter or not, can we just agree that you didn't feel well represented? That's the point I'm getting at. I think we all heard them. You can say that a little better, I think. I want to run that one back. So what have we learned? Somebody of another race doesn't have the power to make you feel embarrassed of your own race. Somebody of your own race does have the power to make you feel embarrassed of your own race. Did you know there's a third thing? Did you know somebody of another race does have the power to make you feel more proud to be your own race? You ever seen somebody do something and go, oh, glad I'm me. We've all done it. It doesn't make you bad but it's something we've all done, right? And that's what I told this guy. I said how can I be embarrassed to be in black when this white woman actually made me feel more proud to be black than I've ever got to feel? Oh, that fucked him up. Oh, you could have saw his face. What? And he goes, how? And I go, how what? He goes, how could a white woman ever make you feel more proud to be black than you've ever felt in your life? And I went, I tell you, she gave me a blowjob during the movie Django Unchained. Like I need you to really process how special that is. You get what I'm saying? Like, look, that ain't an oppressive. That's a freedom fighter if I've ever seen one. You ever seen somebody fight racism? Like it's a snake bite? She's like, calm down. I'll suck it out. I'm like, what the fuck? Bro, you all don't know pleasure. I don't care what kind of sex you've had. You don't know pleasure until you've got to watch a slave master get shot while getting your dicks sucked by somebody that looks like his daughter. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me. I wish my ancestors saw that moment. I wish they were looking down from heaven. Well, look at that. Well, how about going to get a young man? Got what in ally? I still don't think she's getting enough credit. If I'm being told, I don't think everyone's really processing what she did. What a moment. Historically. For race relations, are you processing what just happened? We should be teaching students about her in textbooks. Do you understand what that moment was? It should say Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and Brittany with an eye. It should be all over. These were freedom fighters. They all had very different tactics for fighting racism. One guy was like, turn the other cheek. Another guy was like, fight fire with fire. Brittany was like, blop, blop. Blop. Blop. Blop. Love Brittany. I just don't think she's getting enough credit. That's all I'm trying to say. She deserves a little more credit than she's getting. Just imagine. New enough white women in here. Put yourself in her shoes for a second. Imagine you see a black man who's upset over slavery. And you think, I'm gonna change that. And then you do. But you understand what I'm saying? I used to hate slavery movies. Oh, what a fucking bummer. And now any time one comes out, I'm like, oh, date night. Baby, put your nice dress on. 13 years of slave just came out. Yeah, 13. It's a sequel. Yeah, they franchise it. They're doing the whole thing. Get that throw ready. I heard it goes up to 400. It's a great history joke. As a person who is a proud black man that's unwavering. Not ashamed of where I came from. I'm not ashamed of who I am. But I grew up in mixed neighborhoods. I went to mixed schools. I played for mixed sports teams. As far as I'm concerned, I'm the product of what this country is actually supposed to be. I'm trying to love everybody. That's where I'm coming from. As a person who is actively trying to show love for everybody. I hate it when I see us getting arguments that are meant to divide us by race. Does that make sense? Where it feels like whatever powers that be are more focused on splitting us apart than showing us a way to come together. And I just find it frustrating. Especially when it seems like the answers are so right there in front of us. If we just took the time to listen to each other and realize we actually agree on way more than we disagree on. I'll give an example. I mean that. I think anytime I see somebody get offended at the concept of white privilege. I don't understand why they're upset. Because it's not an attack. And I think it keeps getting mistaken for an attack. I don't think people understand what it is. Right? By definition, privilege is just when the world allows you to do something specific, easier than someone else. Doesn't mean it was easy. It's just easier for you than someone else. That's it. By that definition, we literally all have privilege. You understand what I'm saying? We just have different privileges. So that's why I don't see why it's something worth arguing if someone brings yours up. Because we all get our turns for it to be our thing. So you can't be like it doesn't exist. Of course it exists. You don't think there's black privilege? Fuck, I love black privilege. Did you know I could go to any white wedding I want? I can go to any white wedding I want. Hop right on the dance floor. Start doing every dance moves I want to do. Everybody at the party's got to be like, he's good. That's black privilege, man. Doesn't matter what I do, they think I'm good. Let's take black people out of it, right? Take them out of the equation. Let's give another example. Let's say hypothetically we're watching the national spell-in-beat. It's only two kids left. There's a white kid and there's an Indian kid. Be honest with yourself. Your life's on the line. Who you putting your money on? That's Indian privilege. You feel me? Let's say hypothetically after this we go out to drink. We're having a great time. We're partying, we're being married, we're getting to know each other. Two random women just start making out out of nowhere. Oh, they are fun. Then two random guys start making out out of nowhere. Oh, they are gay. That's female privilege. Do you understand the point I'm trying to make? I'm saying privilege exists in every direction. And the only thing I'm trying to add to this conversation is if you just stop getting defensive when yours gets brought up and you start being willing to have a sense of humor about yourself, you would start to notice how funny all of this can be. And isn't the world better with people who are willing to have a sense of humor about themselves? So just be those people. That's all I'm trying to say. You cool? Thank you. Can I give you an example of white privilege that makes me laugh? I love you. It's not an attack. Let's see how you do. I think white people are the only race of people that like to be scared for fun. Like you feel me? Not an attack. Doesn't make you bad. Makes you interesting. But not bad, but bungee jumping, skydiving, swimming with sharks. These are torture tactics. Some of you pay for them. I just think white people get to have a different relationship with fear. Doesn't make anyone bad. I think it's an interesting observation. White people can have a different relationship with fear. I think white people are the only people you can walk up to and just be like, hey, you want to do something scary today? And y'all won't just outright say no. You feel me? You'll be like, what do you got in mind? You feel me? You go to anybody of another race. They're like, fuck no. But white people have follow-up questions sometimes. They're like, well, what are you thinking? Okay. Look at roller coasters, right? Theme park owners know white people love being scared so much. You'll pay for a picture of your own face terrified. That's their business model. That's how reliable it is. They were like, yeah, that's where we're going to get the rest of the money. I've been in so many white homes and seen a framed picture. The entire family terrified. Why? Why is that even a thing? I haven't been in one black family's home. And seen a picture of four black people absolutely terrified. And they're like, yeah, that's the time I got stuck up at gunpoint right there. That's us. This is where I tried to sell my kids for my own life. So wild to me, man. And I'm just saying what I'm saying, because I understand I'm generally speaking, right? I'm speaking in generalities. I understand there are special case scenarios for everything. So please, like, I'm not being irresponsible with this. Just be on the same page with me. I'm just saying generally speaking, though, that kind of holds true. I'm saying generally speaking. I feel like white people feel fear so rarely. That y'all scheduled it as a vacation activity. Like, you feel it? I was like, literally put it on a schedule. You're like at 12. We're going to have lunch at one. We're going to pet a tiger. You're like, what the fuck are you talking about? A tiger. Huh? You know what? No one black has ever said to me, I want to go on a safari. Now, once, I got so many black friends, no one's ever wanted to go. It's our country, and we're like, nah. But I have so many white friends that want to go. It doesn't make them bad. I'm just saying it's an interesting difference that you can spot and go, oh shit, okay. Why doesn't the safari sound insane to everybody? I didn't realize it was something we were so polarized on. I thought we were all of the same mind. Like, that's fucking crazy. And apparently, we don't agree. I never understood why this is crazy. You want to go to the zoo without the walls? That's what we want to do. You want to take away my favorite part of the zoo? The part where they can't get me? That's where we're taking away? Oh, all right. Every time I go to the zoo, people are looking at the animals. I'm looking at the structures. I'm like, that's a good wall. Like that net. Love that glass. I've never understood it. Why doesn't a safari sound dangerous to everybody? It's not even a safe web browser. You feel me? You ever open up safari in front of somebody with Firefox? What the fuck are you doing, man? They make it sound like you just fucked a hooker with no condom. They're like, we'll close it. Throw it away. Who knows what's in there now? It's so wild, man. I'll entertain it. Like, I'll talk to my white friends. Their defenses are so bad. And I'm not saying these are all white people's defenses. I'm saying you wouldn't want to be represented by my wife. That's what I'm saying. The stuff they argue, I go, hey, that's a bad one. They'll be like, just go on a safari. You're going to be fine. I'm like, based on what? They're like, you got a tour guy. I'm like, that nigga's not a wall. It's like, what are you think is going to happen? If a lion saw us and was like, oh, I'm about to eat these motherfuckers. You think he's just going to be coming at you? I'm going to be like, oh shit, they brought the guy. God dammit. Hey, wrap it up, guys. They brought the fucking guy. You don't think the lion just sees more than a lion? I'm going to be like, what's the problem? I'm going to be like, what's the problem? Hey, wrap it up, guys. They brought the fucking guy. You don't think the lion just sees more food? That's what I can't get. That's not how your brain works. You think of a lion saw a black tour guy and two white tourists. You don't think he's going, oh shit, dark meat and mashed potatoes. Oh, fuck. Looks like KFC came to me. What are we talking about? What do you think the tour guy's going to do? Entertain it for a second. What do you think that's just a guy on the clock? You think that guy actually cares about your livelihood? A lion's coming at you all he sees it? You think this dude is just going to step in the way? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, lion. No, no, no, no, lion. Not today, lion. You eat zebra lion. Zebra black and white. These people just white. No goods. No goods. That's why we bring you mixed kid. Blad. Blad. Where has Blad gone? It's so fucking stupid. It just makes me laugh. Like I'm just fucking around, but you get where I'm coming from, right? Like you get the point I'm getting at. That's all I'm saying. I just think fear is such a great example for us to explore the country. We're all just trying to explore the concept of privilege where everybody can see it and realize no one's the villain. But you can identify the differences. I just think it's a great example, you know? Like I, can I tell you something real wild? I got a wild theory. I think I'm on something. I just don't know how to prove it. But I think I figured something out. I think I know why each race has a different relationship with fear. Especially fear for fun. I think I can see what it is. It's kind of a wild theory, but I think I'm on to it. I think if you come from an oppressed group, you've never been so bored with life that you're willing to risk yours. Does that make sense? Like I don't know Jews that like escape rooms. You know you came to a comedy show, right? I'm not running for office. I'm not the guy. I'm just here to make the funny points. I think I'm on something. I don't know Jews that like escape rooms. I don't know black people that are in the bondage. Whips and chains, you said. Fool me once. I don't know any Mexicans that want to do a tough mother. That's a real good one. Like if you know what a tough mother is, that's all I'm pointing. If you don't know what a tough mother is, just around the same page. A tough mother, it's one of those races you do out in the middle of nowhere. It's a foot race where you're just going through an obstacle course. You're going through like water hazards, running over hills, running through like electrified fences. I don't know one Mexican who's like again, yeah, for sure. Yeah, let's do it. Get the fuck out of here. I did that to get it. And I fit in fuck out of here, my God. All I'm trying to get at here, I'm not trying to attack anybody. I just want us to understand this concept better so we can get past it. Right? Anytime I see somebody online or on TV or wherever, say that privilege doesn't exist. I need you to understand, you're not a bad person. But you are wrong. All right, I'm not trying to come at you. But you are actually wrong and you sound ridiculous to people who do understand. Just take the time to understand. All right, privilege exists. But I'm a six foot three black man. There's not one person in here that thinks my dick small. That's my privilege. I get big dick privilege. Doesn't matter if you're right or not. You didn't think it. That's my privilege, man. If I was an Asian comic saying all this same shit, you wouldn't have thought the same thing. Beyond, there's not one woman in here who's been at a bar, seeing an Asian dude and been like, oh, he might dick me down. And he might, he might do it. But you weren't thinking it. That's my privilege. I get big dick privilege. It's a hardship. I have to work over every day. Try to overcome. But when you say privilege doesn't exist, you know what I always think of? It's always this story. It's such a banana story. When I was a kid, I remember telling my dad what my dream job was. I told him I was five years old. I told him I wanted to be in the NBA. My dad is a black man from Alabama in the 1940s. He's not a big dreamer. It's a very practical man. His vibe is more like, survive. I'm like, okay. That's what he's like. And I remember, I told him I wanted to be an NBA player. You know what he told me? Just have a backup plan. I was like, God damn, can I dream for a little bit? I'm five. But that's what he felt like he needed to communicate to me based on his experiences in this country as a black man. Fair enough, I accept that perspective. I hear you. Meanwhile, my best friend, next door neighbor. I was there when this happened. I remember seeing him tell his dad what he wanted to be. He said that he wanted to be the first black president in U.S. history. You know what his dad told him? Anything you put your mind to, you can achieve. Isn't that beautiful? But that kid was white. Don't tell me white privilege doesn't exist. My God, I was there. I saw this shit with my own eyes. I saw this white father. Who is a good man? I still talked to him to this day. See his white son look at him and go, I want to be the first black leader of the free world. And with me still in the room. He looks at his son and goes, well, if you just work hard enough, I'm like, get the fuck out of here. Tell us, get no. Tell him that one's not for him. Couldn't do it. Privileges just such an interesting topic. And I don't want to harp on it too much longer, but I just want to drive this point home. Okay. I do feel like if we're being fair to both sides, there are privileges that white people do get attacked for. And I don't think it's fair. If we're being critical to both sides, when we're trying to come together, right? I do think there's one thing I've seen y'all do that I do find very funny. And I hope you find it as funny as I do. And I don't think it's fair that you do get slack for it. I do think white people are the only race of people that I've seen get offended on behalf of a group. They are not a part of. Like, you know who to picture. Right? That's all I'm saying. But here's the thing. You know what to attack you for. Because I believe at its core that's something of goodwill. That just mean you cared for another group of people. You were trying to speak on their behalf because you thought you were doing right by them, right? That's a good thing. That's nothing to attack you for. It may not be the way we want you to do it, but that's okay. Right? And here's the thing about it. It's a really complicated situation. Because if you look online, you see this happen all the time. White people will do something on behalf of black people. Black people go, don't do that. And then white people go, oh, my bad. What would you prefer me to do? And black people go, I don't know. And they were just left nowhere. But both of those sides are fair to be clear. Those are both fair dispositions. Sometimes it's hard to come up with a resolution. You just know when someone isn't doing the right one. That's fair. And it's fair to care and not know what to do. So it still leaves us in the same place of what do you do when you're trying to have someone else's back. I think I came up with something. Hear me out here. All right. Listen, I think this is a universal way to show support for a group you're not a part of. You can use this in any group. I don't know anyone who had turned us down. And I don't know what you do after this, but you can always start with this. I'm giving an example. As a black person, if I'm there, I don't like it when I see somebody white till somebody else white that they can't say the end word. Because that's my line. You feel me? That's what I get to say. Are you trying to upstage me, man? This is my big moment. You know what I need you to do? I need you to say motherfucker after my line. That's support. You get what I'm saying? Dude, I get to go, you don't get to call me a nigger, and then you come in like, motherfucker, and I'm like, okay, so now I feel strong. I feel supported. We're a team. You feel what I'm saying? I'm done with allies. Be my motherfucker. I need more lows. That's what I need. Because I don't think there's anything scarier to a racist person than a black man with a white army. He'd be like, oh, fuck, his cause must be good. I think that's actually scared. Stop being my ally. Be my motherfucker. I don't know when I started caring about all this kind of shit. If you saw my show like five years ago, I was talking about nothing like this, you know? I don't know what happens. I got a little right there. I started boating. You started boating. I'm going to throw some opinions out of here because I'm here in some wild shit. It's weird as you age the way your priorities change, the way your life changes. I'm not trying to be like, age and sucks. I'm cool with it. But it is weird the ways in which you age that you didn't anticipate. Does that make sense? Those are the ones that are weird for me. Like the regular one, like my knees are sore. I got to wake up early. I'll probably go to a matinee. Like those are the, I find. I was ready for that. But the weird ones where I'm like, nobody told me that was part of it. What the fuck is going on with me? Like I heard the other day, I heard a rap song. I couldn't relate to one part of. I was like, what the fuck was that? That's a weird moment itself, real estate. Look, I don't know if you've ever been black before. I've done it my whole life. If you hear an entire rap song and you end up going, shit, I don't think any of that was for me. What a weird moment in your black existence. I was like, where do I fit into this? I still remember what the guy said. I swear to God, I think you're relate. Yeah, I remember he went, I got an actress on my mattress. I'm going to hit it three times in one night. That's a hat trick. And my brain just went exhausting. That's all I felt. Three times in one night, I was like, not for me. That's crazy. Three times, brah, you don't got work in the morning. Nobody's pussy's better than sleep. I'll tell you right now. And that's not an attack. The older you get, the truer that rings and you fucking know it. That's not an attack. Ladies, I'm sure your pussy's great. Sleep is good. I like sleep more than sex and it ain't even close. I know that. You know, I like sleep more than sex? I go to sleep every day. I'll miss one. I only have sex sometimes. And even when I have sex, when I'm done, I'm like, God damn, I want to go to sleep. If that's all about me, you had been like, I got an actress on my mattress. I'm gonna hit it one time, then I'm napping. That's my entire... I'm like, yo, this... Hey! Trying to hit them nightquill bars, brah? I just think it's so weird to see the things that make you change as you get older. I think it's weird to look at other people your age and see the shit they care about versus the shit you care about. You ever seen that? You're on Facebook and you're like, what are they fucking random about? You ever have those moments where like, this is the hill you want to die on? This is the cause you stand for of all the things? Have you seen this group of people that's trying to get Disney's Snow White cancelled? Oh my God, I'm losing my mind over it. There are adults, our eight voters, people whose votes count the same as yours. They're out here trying to bring down a cartoon. They're so dedicated. Have you heard the argument? She never gave consent to the kiss that woke her up. That's what they're arguing. Now listen, I'm not trying to be on the wrong side of an issue. I'm not trying to sound like I got some hot takes. I'm just saying, you've all seen the movie, right? We've all seen Snow White. All I'm saying, it really feels like they're leaving out the whole, he did it to save her life part, huh? Is that not a crucial detail in the context of that circumstance? Like if you were the prince and that happened to you, wouldn't you want to confront her? Like, hey, you want to explain the rest of that though? So I'll sound like a creep. Appreciate that. You got me out here sounding like Bill Cosby right now. I'm just saying that dude was putting them to sleep. I'm just waking them up. This is a totally different thing. I don't think you should be allowed to make someone who attempted to save your life out to be a predator. That's the only line in the saying I'm drawing here. I think that deserves to be defended. If I tried to save you, I'm not a creep. When I was a kid, when I was seven, right, I grew up in Tampa. When I was seven, I was at the beach. I remember I was swimming in the ocean. I'm swimming poorly if I'm drowning. Let's be honest. I'm drowning. I'm for sure drowning. I passed out. I sunk onto the water. I had to be saved by a male lifeguard. I said, you know, I woke up on the beach. Two in male lifeguard giving me mouth to mouth for cessetation. And when I came to, I completely understood what that situation was. There was no confusion. I wasn't like, oh, Nick, I'll see you in court. Okay. You ever heard of me, too? We'll meet three now, bro. I just think it's such a weird circumstance to like, this is the hill you want to die on for this argument. Not against consent culture. I'm asking, is this where you really want to make you stand? Within this premise? That's what's odd about it to me, you know? Like, have y'all gone back and watch the movie? Like, as adults, is weird, man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. It's weird, man. It's real weird. Do you remember what the curses? True love's kiss will wake her up. That's real specific. Like, they really narrowed down the danger that could have come. You got to be pretty sure to go for it. It's not like they went, hey, man, first one of kisser gets the keeper. Then a bunch of dudes started marching to get to her first. My hoe, my hoe. Back up. You got it. You got it. I'm just saying it's just such a weird place to make your argument. I can understand. To be clear, I can understand where you're coming from. If you were just like, I just wish it wasn't a kiss that he had to do to save her. I can appreciate that. I'm just saying, but can you stop making it sound like he squeezed the titty when he did it? That's more, right? That's more, I'm coming. I'll make it very clear because this is a tricky topic to make jokes about. Obviously, at the end of the day, I understand my place within this premise, right? I'm a man lightly making jokes about sexual assault. I understand that. And I can never put myself in the position of a woman in relation to a topic like this. I understand that. All I can do is empathize the best I can from the perspective that I have. And that's as a black man in this country. And I'm just saying, as a black man in this country, I don't get what you're talking about. Let me say hypothetically, right? Hypothetically speaking, I'm an acoma. I'm dying. And you say the only way to save me is for a white dude to whisper the inword in my ear. What do you see what I'm saying? Here's the kicker. If we're being honest, I don't need him to ask for my permission. My life's on the line. They're bigger priorities at hand. Do what you got to do. But I don't care if you're whispered. Get on all fours for all I care. Nigger. Nigger. I mean, hey, I heard you the first time. Steve got down. Can you give me a sec to wake up? I take a second. No, I appreciate what you're trying to do. But we're going to talk about that second one. You don't get to call me two niggers and then y'all would say, look at my army for me. Oh, look at that. That's how you fucking do it. That's a weird example. Let me give you a better one. That's what I'd see what you were going to do. Let's say hypothetically, I'm an acoma. And I'm dying. And you say the only way to save me is true loves kids. Just like the movie. I assume y'all would want that handle the exact same way I would want that handle. I would want somebody to go round up everybody in town, form a line, take my weekend at Bernie's body, prop that shit up in a kissing booth, put some cool ass shades on that motherfucker, look back at the line and go, all right, everybody would I hurt because it goes first. You feel me? You feel me? Is that not what you want? Like, let's be real for a second. I want to make it very clear, I am not against consent culture. On the contrary, it couldn't be more for it. But that's not the place to make your stand. I do think after all of the allegations we've heard from women over the last couple of years, men should be making more of a point to showcase to women how much we do have your backs, how much you are going to see like a change in the behavior you've been encountering, even if we're not the individual's responsible for it. What I'm getting at is that we need a show that we have your backs. You feel me? But the question then becomes, how do we show you that? Here's what I'm pitching. Men, start making consent your biggest kink. Take a sec, process what I'm saying. Start making consent the kinkiest shit that you're into. Start being a fucking freak for yeses. You feel me? Like after the Me Too movement show on what you've learned, anytime a woman goes, how do you like it? I'm like with permission. Like I lean in. I lean in. Bro, I don't unzip it till you say please. You could be like, get over here and fuck me. I'd be like, hmm, is that how we ask? At this point having sex with me is like binge watching Netflix. Every so often I interrupt the flow just to be like, do you still want this? Yes or cancel? Are you awake? I'm joking, I fucking ran. It's a good question asked. This is all I'm trying to get at as a whole, right? Like I think it's very clear that I'm a liberal person, right? But if I could say anything in an effort to bring us together, whether you're conservative or whether you're liberal, any of that shit, man. Like all I'm trying to suggest to bring us together is that if you look out at whatever's going on in society, the society, the culture that you are in and you feel change coming, you're certain. It's coming no matter how you feel that is going to be a regularity. It's not going to hurt you to learn something so that you can be a part of it. You understand? You don't even got to believe in it. But you're going to have to coexist with these exact same people. It's not going to hurt you to understand their stuff better. Does that make sense? That's all I'm trying to get at because when you don't know what you're talking about, it's fucking jarring. And I just need you understand, stop being that person. We've all done it. Why are we continuously trying to do that again? I was in Kansas City a couple months ago. I flow in to do a show. I get off the plane. I order an Uber. I get this alert on my phone, this notification, it says, Frog will be here in five minutes to pick you up. I'm looking at the picture. It's a picture of a woman, right? It says Frog. It's a picture of a person I believe identifies as a woman. Let's be honest, right? But it's Frog. That's what it says. I'm not reading it wrong. It's not a tough word. Frog. I'm thinking about it. I'm having this debate in my head. I'm going to be like, I mean, she ain't hurting anybody. It's a non-binary name. No one's getting hurt. If you want to be called Frog, you're frog. I accept you. Frog, I can't wait to meet you. Put my phone away. I go out. I wait for the car to show up. She pulls up. I open the car door. I lean inside and go, hey, how you doing? She looks back and goes, rib it. I went, nope. Close the car door. I'm going to be like, oh, no. I'm going to be like, oh, no. Too much progress in that car. You're doing what I'm saying. I'm not saying she did something wrong. I'm saying I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready for the journey frog was going to take me on. But had I done more research, who knows where we could have ended up? I don't have more story because I was ill-prepared. That's all I'm getting at. It's not going to hurt you to learn. Some progressive things. They're the wildest shit you've ever seen. But they're kind of cool. I did a show in Denver once. One of my best friends lives around the corner from a club. We do a show. We come out. It's 11.30 at night. I'm watching him walk home to his house. You've got to go around the corner. As soon as he gets to the end of the street, this is going to sound made up. This is exactly what happened. As soon as he got to the end of the street, I saw 17agers all on scooters, like bird scooters. They ride from around a corner. They ride up to them. And then they just started circling around them. It's one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen in my life. In real time, in nature, this is happening. They just wrote up to him. I watched seven children kidnap my adult friend. And I had no idea how to advise him. He's like looking back at me. And I'm like, I think they got you, man. I think they just got you. I've seen animal planet. I know this isn't a good thing. I don't know where it leads, but I know you're not bad. You know what they started doing? One of the most bizarre things I've ever seen in my life. They just started bullying in him. Like verbally bullying a grown man. I'd never seen something like this in my life. They just started going, you're gay. You're gay. Can I just say side note to see anyone riding a scooter going, you're just, what are we, what? What am I looking at? Look, I'm not against you, but come on. This is, huh? You're gay. What? I'm seeing seven of them do it. And they just keep going, you're gay. You're gay. And what this dude said back, y'all, I'll never forget this rest of my life. This might be the most progressive thing I have ever heard in my life. They go, you're gay and he goes, that's your opinion. And I was like, what the fuck was that? Did anybody else know that was an option of things? You could say back to your gay, that's your opinion. What an insane way to win the argument. Because he won. Be clear. That was a victory, but like that? That'd be like if somebody called me a nigger and I just went, to each their own. What? That's what I saw. You know what I learned? Did you know that no one can insult you if they aren't convinced that you understand that was an insult? Did you know all you've ever had to do was say crazy shit back? And no one could ever hurt you? Dude, it happened to me every day. Something you called me a jungle monkey. I was like, to make it a tomato. It's like, how do you attack that guy? You feel me? Something's like, you a little pussy boy. I'm like, that's the way to cookie crumbles. You can't get him. You know? Something's like, you can't read. I'm like, you're not my real dad. I love it. I just don't think progress is such a bad thing when you start to understand it more. That's all I'm really getting at. That's all I'm saying. I'm not trying to sway it. Whatever you vote, you vote. That's what you do. I'm just saying I don't think it's actually that bad a thing when you just have an open heart to it. You go like, oh shit, is that what's going on? One of the things I hate is like when we get labeled as a whole. Like as a liberal. When people go like liberals. You know what I mean? Libdars, all that shit. And you're like, we're just going to be like, yeah, that's me. I hate it when we get lumped together. Is it for not all individuals who have their own minds, who have their own string of logic, who have their own priorities? That irks me. You think all liberals agree? We don't. We bicker all the time. We don't have the same priorities. That's crazy to me. I'll give you one of mine. Look, I came from Florida and then moved to California. I thought I was liberal. And then I got there. And I was like, ooh, I'm liberal for Florida. It's a different thing. It is a different thing. You know? Here's my big one. I don't understand how drinking from plastic straws equals eye-hate turtles. It's too big a leap for me, man. There's just, there's too much in-between there. I don't hate turtles. I'm just too black to care about this right now. I've got my own things going on. You know what I mean? That's all I'm getting at. No one saying green lives don't matter. But black lives called it first. And you can get in line. I've been here a while. And just to be clear, you ain't next in line, turtles. We still got women and gay people. The Amazon rainforest was on fire. You gonna be here a while, turtles. I just don't understand that notion. No one's saying we should care less about turtles. I'm saying we should care more about me. And I can't believe I got to make that case sometime. Like, okay, let's say hypothetically. If Martin Luther King Jr. was still alive to this day. And he saw how gung-ho we were for saving sea turtles from plastic. Wild racism still exists. Don't you feel like he'd be like, you motherfuckers have got to be good and married. Like, like on some level, that do be upset, right? That's all I'm saying. So we can sense it. I hate that I have to defend myself from these straw people. I don't know what else to call them. Like, I've been called out seven times for it. Seven. I'm counting. Seven times. I've been in a bar. I'm sipping on a sprite. Some woman walks up to me. She's always white. But she's always, it just is what it is. I'm not saying she's bad, but why is she always white? She comes up to me. She confronts me about it. Did you really need a drink from that? I go, I'm sorry? Did you really need a drink from a plastic straw? I don't even listen. I just take a knee. I'm like, I'm not going to be a part of this. I'm not going to. I'm just going to do it. She doesn't get to say that. Like, I understand. She cares about turtles, but that's not your fight to bring to me. If a turtle came up and was like, you can't drink from a plastic straw. And then she was like, I'm going to drink from a plastic straw. And she cares about turtles, but that's not your fight to bring to me. If a turtle came up and was like, you can't drink from a plastic straw. And then she was like, mother fucker? I'd be like, OK, I'm wrong. No, I'm wrong. Fuck. No. Shit. But that's not what happens. I just don't get it. It's not fair. You don't get to decide how I feel about turtles. You don't fucking know me. You don't know what I've done. I give you a crazy story. And as a kid, I had to stay with a family member who was requested to stay anonymous in this story, because I told him it was going into special, and he was like, I need my job. You'll stay anonymous, my guy. But he should be ashamed of himself. I stayed over his house for a summer. He has a pool in the backyard. It's one morning, we wake up, we look in the backyard. There's a pool. Excuse me, there's a pool. There's a turtle wandering around me. There's a turtle wandering around the pool. It's just a regular turtle to be clear. It's a turtle. It's not hurting anybody. It's not like a big turtle. It's not smiling. It's just a turtle. It's just wandering around. You'd have thought this dude had just stumbled upon an actual home invasion. He's like, what the fuck? What the fuck? Who the fuck does he think he is? I heard an adult man say that sentence about a turtle. Who the fuck does he think he is? About a turtle? He storms off to the phone. He calls up animal control. I shit you not. He goes, y'all need to get this fucking turtle out my yard or I'm a shoot it. He started the conversation with that. Not who he is, not where he's located. None of that information was important. They need to know if they don't get this fucking turtle out his yard, he's gonna shoot it. I hear the woman on the other side of the line. By the way, I'm seven. I'm watching this like adults are crazy. I hear the woman on the other line. You know what she does? I shit you not. I can hear it. It's so funny. She just goes, good luck to you, sir. Hangs up the phone. I was like, oh! She called his bluff. I watched the... I swear to God, I watched an adult man have a fucking meltdown. Actually, I knew what a meltdown was when I was seven. Because I saw him go, what the fuck? I saw his brain. I come to that conclusion and realtor... I got to shoot this turtle. And just to be clear, it ain't a special turtle. Just to fight. No ninja turtle, just a Danny DeVito looking turtle. The thing you're thinking of. All right. This dude storms off to his bedroom. He takes a couple seconds. Comes back, he's got a fucking handgun. He's got an actual handgun. It's big. Big gun. It's walking straight for the back door. And I stepped in his way. I was like, hey. You can't shoot a turtle. Sentens I never thought I'd have to say in my life. You can't shoot a turtle. This dude goes. You're right. You shoot the turtle. I'm joking. Could you imagine? It's time to be a man. I get this way. I say you can't shoot a turtle. And he goes. I'm going to shoot a turtle. You can't shoot a turtle. And he goes. Now he goes back to his room. Puts his gun away. You understand what I'm saying? The fuck of you done for turtles. I earned my fucking straw. If you don't like it, you can suck my dick. Thank you guys so much, man. Thank you guys.

 How many clubs are closed but I still want to do stand up. I think we just got to get people's roofs, get a mic and amp. That's all we need. Hammer crew, you, Dom, a few other people. We shoot it. We cut it up. That's the special. Good. You can tell this is a big election by the celebrities who are telling you to vote. It's people who are not used to hearing from. I'm seeing tweets like register now and I'm like, Charlie Sheen. This is bad. Did you see the one with the celebrities role naked telling you to vote? How are they going to up the ante in 2024? I'm Stanley Tucci and I'm jerking off on FaceTime to remind you of the importance of this year's election. There's two people fighting for free speech right now. It's comedians and racist. Isn't that weird? I didn't think we would be joining forces on a mission. It's just weird to see skinheads saying things like, we need to protect the first amendment. I'm like, I guess I stand with the area nation. It's racist like the first amendment because you could say racist shit and you get away with it though, you know. Racism is free speech so I like a tomato is a fruit. Technically but if you put it in a fruit salad, it is going to fuck up the rest of the fruit. That's an issue. I guess it depends who's saying it. I've had friends who might call me Jew face and I'm like, yeah, whatever. And then the people I don't know that will call me buddy and I'm like, I do not care for that. That was annoying. Everyone thinks they're free speech at stake. It's not. You can say a lot. I got a death threat recently. I just said I want to kill you and I ended up having to show it to a cop and the cop goes, he said he wants to kill you not that he's going to. I was like, yeah, but that's an annoying loophole. He got to give me that. God says, I'm going to do that to me. I kick his fucking ass. I was like, cool, so they're going to do nothing. They call me a pussy. That's fine. Serving protect officer. Serving protect. Feels like we're doomed. I mean, there's a god. Don't you feel like God is up in the sky right now. Flat screen TV. Every country is a different channel. I feel like America. We're like the Bravo of God's cable package. We're like, look, it's entertaining. But these people are fucking trash. God watches six, right hours of America. Like, oh, I hate myself. I've got to start reading again. Growing up now must be the worst. Kids just beat the shit out of you and they emotionally fuck with you on the internet. Cyber bullying feels right. Like, when I was a kid, it was AOL or instant messenger. Not so bad. You had to make sure your parents weren't on the phone to cyber bully, you know? You had to be like, mom, get off with grandma. I'm trying to ruin lives, okay? Shit. It was a bigger deal. Cyber bullying now. I hate when older people are like, I used to get the shit kicked out of me. Log off. I'm like, all right, first off, it's hard to log off. It's very addictive. And second off, you know, who wouldn't rather be assaulted than psychologically torment it? What would you rather get a wedgie or catfished? A black eye will heal. You know what won't is taking a greyhound to Syracuse and being like, I thought you'd be a woman. This sucks. This is the worth 13th birthday ever. That joke got sadder and sadder. You're the roommates? Oh, hell yeah, this dude came straight out of Woodstock. I like this guy. He's like, look, I had to stop at a festival. Yeah, I love that, man. What do you do for work, man? I'm a designer. I just not a fucking, of course. Only designer would have the balls to pull this off and be like, you know what? It's working. I'm a designer. I work for Cosmo. Oh, hell yeah. Cosmo. To give it women bad advice for decades. Cosmo. Ladies, this is what he really wants. Silence. I've never seen that article. I've never seen a Cosmo article. Give him peace for one day and everything will be great. Are all you guys in finance? No, what do you do? Real estate. All right. And your mom's in real estate, too? His mom? All right. What do you do? I work at Amazon. Fuck, part of the problem. But I do. Hey, wait. Unless we sell this to Amazon, in which case, very good people. And I'm going to handle this like Trump. Hey, they could be great people. We don't know. We don't know how they feel about me. You have to invite more people than you want here because people just bail. These aren't Hamilton tickets. This is a rooftop comedy show. They're just like, oh, yeah, I don't need to go to that. So I threw a hey, mass text. Anyone want to give me the roof tonight? Someone just said, I can't make it tonight. I've got COVID. The honor code, baby. Yeah. I don't go to Paul V with messing up Puerto Rico. Yeah. You say, Hunter? Sure, yeah. What's up? You go, Paul V. Yeah. Hey, Paul V. What's up? Hi. What? It's Sam. Oh, my God. It's Sam. Oh, my God. How are you? I found out about you during quarantine. And you got me through quarantine. Oh, thank you. I've been going to meet you. Oh, my God. This is so cool. You got you through quarantine. You're meeting me. I met Jack Daniels. I've been drinking on meds. I recommend it. You ever do this Google search? How much you could drink on the meds you're on? That's a... I just go with the article that matches how much I feel like... like drinking. I'm like, according to the medical journal of Guadalajara. I can have as much as I want. This is awesome. And it's outdoor drinking. Now, this started a spring break. It very quickly became end of the world vibes. But either way, cheers. You know? I was drinking on the street in this neighborhood. I was having a drink on the sidewalk. And this waitress comes up to me. You can't hear a word they're saying because this is Manhattan. So she didn't even ask. She just does this. Oh, my dam. Small businesses are getting crushed. This sucks. Now, you feel the divide when you go on the road. I love going to different parts of the country. It's one of my favorite things about America is going to Kentucky. You play that never would have gone, probably. I went to the racetrack in Kentucky, which is amazing. I was a worst-dressed person there. I was the only one who didn't look like a villain in Django on chain. But I walked to the racetrack. All the horses have ridiculous names. There's always one that's a little too crazy. There'll be like in third place, Moonlit Garden. In second place, Autumn Nights. And in first place, Touchy Uncle. I'm like, what was that? Was that last one? Touchy Uncle. They're like the champ. I like this out, man. They still do Civil Warry enactments, which is kind of weird. They're very hung up on that L. They don't want to talk about it. That's weird. They do that. I asked a guy, why do they still do Civil Warry enactments? He said, well, it gives them a connection. They're ancestors. That's not true. Because you would never recreate a fight that you lost. But you'd never be like, honey, remember that time I was wrong? And fight some friends over. Let's run it back. That would be awesome. You ever date someone and you're both in therapy? The fights take 10 hours. Every argument is like, I hear you. And I appreciate where you're coming from. However, he's like, oh, that was my whole day. I heard a guy in Times Square the other day said it was girlfriend shut up, bitch. And I was like, that is not okay. But he is crushing me in time management. You know what women hate when you're arguing they hate when you tell them to calm down? So now when she yells at me, I say, love your energy. Love what you're doing. A little more. I'm annoying. I repeat myself. I said I was like, man, I love this Thai restaurant. She was, you've told me that three times. And I said, you're the only person that I hang out with anymore. You want to spend all your time with me? There's going to be reruns. I can't bring it every night. That's what a relationship is. It's like a TV show where the writing gets progressively worse. Because season one, you're like, this is good. Season three comes along. You're like, we should kill off a character. We got to keep people engaged here. I was on the phone with my friend the other day. You ever just not listen to the new guests at the end? My friend said, I don't know what to do about her. And I was like, I think you should fuck her. And he was like, my mom. I was not present for all of that conversation. And I threw a Hail Mary. I'm not a good partner. I can't date. I'm not. I don't listen. Women always shocked. You're a bad listener. But I speak for a living. You should have seen that comment. I bet most people are bad at the opposite of their job. I bet most terrorists or shitty architects. I bet Ben Laden was a bad city planner. Most audiences laugh at jokes. You guys are like, we are shocked. We are shocked in a palt. And then we laugh. No, man. This is going to be good. So I had a brick. What? The mic cut out? How for how long? Four seconds. Four seconds. Fuck. Just like how I have sex, guys. Four seconds. And then I'm like, oh, there we go. All right. Well, this is a good start. It's good when the mic doesn't work. It's good fucking juju. I only said juju because I see all the amicus. That's why it's why I said juju. Are we good now? Yeah. This will work for our mics not working montage and the special. This is happened before. You have to hold the mic like this to make sure it's like working the clitoris. There's a lot of finesse. All right. There we go. How are we now? Good? That's a little rough. Bobby, I don't know if this is... This is used to guitars. It's not used to a raspy juu voice. So, how about now? Don't mind the drone. I know you guys, when you see eyebrows like this in American drone, you don't have long. But I will say it's going to be okay. Breakups are painful, right? Because your friend speaks to you in cliches. My friend was like, oh, dude, it's like a death. I was like, is it? Well, my grandma died. None of my friends were like, thank God. Your grandma was the worst. I don't think actually she's going to make it. We always like that. She's a lovely woman. You guys are snuggled up. That's fucking... You got how long you guys been together? Must be not that long. Right? Because that's... Yeah? Two years? Wow! Good for you! Don't give them too much credit. Some of us are going through personal things right now. Where do you guys meet? Church? Oh my God. What the fuck? I guess that's good PR for church. You never hear about the adult relationships that come out of there. What? Sorry. One of my best friends is a Catholic guy. I give him a ton of shit about the pedophilia in the priesthood. And he gets so angry the other day he said to me, he goes, teachers fuck kids too. And I was like, I like that angle. Right? That's good. But I understand what he's saying. It's not a problem exclusive to the church, but he is making it sound like everyone does it, dude. Why don't you just back off? And I've seen pictures of some of these teachers. It is a different degree of my West Asian. We're talking top shelf versus bottom shelf. No? I'm losing you? I'm jerked off the teacher porn. I've never typed in hot horny cardinals. Yes. Oh yeah. Thank God for Hawaiian shirt guy. I was in trouble. I did really care in that joke. Some of you guys were like, we're not so sure. He's like, I'm all in on this one. I too have jerked off the teacher porn. Teacher porn, man. That is, what you go to when you're watching it? Do you have one? Yeah. Girl on guy. Very good. I got good news for you. The internet is loaded with that. Girl on guy. He's like, holy shit. This is, I am in luck. That's the best finish to have. It's tough after a breakup because I travel a lot. When you travel, you think of the person. Anything goes wrong on a plane. I'm like, shit, if anything happens, I know she knows I love her. What do you think of as a single guy in that scenario? If this thing goes down, I hope my friend Phil knows I only like him in small doses because he could be a lot. She's never at a one night stand I have. And she was scared I was going to cheat on her. I was scared she was going to fall in love with someone, which I think is way worse. She would send me text like, did anyone hit on you after the show? And I'd send her text like, hey, do you feel safe with anyone from work? That would not be okay with me. These coast people drink, west coast people smoke. Every time I say I'm going to have a drink, they always say, you should smoke weed instead. Instead, like at the similar experience, I drink to quiet the voices in my head. I smoke weed. It's like I had a party in here and only the worst people showed up. Every voice is like, you're weird looking. You're going to die alone. That's why alcohol is one voice and it's very positive. You have a few drinks and someone shows up in your head like, cool jacket. You don't have abs but you're right there, dude. Love it. I smell some weed. I'm not going to lie. I'm looking right at you guys just by, just by profiling. Like it's definitely coming from the band and the artist. Do I want some? Of course, but I'm trying to put a show on for you guys. And it's going to turn into a very weird show. If every other joke I'm like, why didn't you guys like that one? What was wrong with it? I was so drunk like about eight months ago. I was leaving my friend's house. I hail a cab or six in the morning. I'm stumbling. I hail a cab again. The car's the driver goes, look, Guardia. He's in the airport. And I'm wasted. So I just said, yes. He just drive me the airport as the sun is coming up. I've got no luggage. And then I finally sobered up a little. I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. JFK. It's a better heart. I got a shake, Jack. Let's go there. Wednesday. Are you putting it out? I'm trying to see if I got a Wednesday show. I don't fucking know. It's a problem. We got two-thirds day. Hey, Sam Rao here. You've got a roof for this Wednesday night. We will come. Cool friends, a mic, an amp. Nice view with help and some white claw. We'll be there. If you build it, we will come. Hit me up. Let's do like a full mile radius. I don't know if it works that way. Oh, we got some people. Yeah, but there's like 150 people right now. That's a lot of people to blast. I can't do that. First one attacks me. Hey, a rare man had in text. Private show. Private show, roof, starting in 20. Yeah. Is that real? Hey, my biological father, he lives in artist's house. Which is weird because he's not even an artist. And anyway. He always escape artists. I met my biological father very late in life. I had a great mom and dad who raised my mom. He was my biological mom. But then I met my biological dad late. And the term is legally adopted when he adopts you. Even if you're not in a fucking orphanage, they say legally adopted. Which is such a dumb term. What's, you could just say adopted. What's illegally adopted? Couldn't have it, right? Anyway, first time I met him though, I go to his apartment. And he's just, he's petting a little cat on the left. And I was like, huh. He's like, yeah, I rescued her from the side of the road. And I nursed her back to health. I was like, huh. So you did have it in you. I run into him at the rec center. And the most New York thing to run into him at the Y. I run it because he goes over physical therapy. I go there to swim lamps, you know. Which, you know, I know it doesn't look like it, but I do put work in this physique, unfortunately. I see him at the rec center and I was awkward. I said, hey, and he goes, hey. And I just panicked and I said, I'll be right back. And I just left. And I feel like on some level, he had to be like, well, play it. All done. New Yorkers have more fun energy, even the crazy people. At least you're entertained, you know. I was on the train, the other night late. This guy walks down. There's only a few people on the train just goes, y'all motherfuckers scared now. Just keeps looking at me, keeps going, y'all motherfuckers scared. And like the third time he said it, we're like, yes, we are scared. This is the right response. You were chemically imbalanced. And there's only two of us. I figured out, you know when the worst time to see a homeless person is, is right after you ate a bunch of sushi, that's the worst, right? Because they're like, I'm starving. I'm like, I know me too. This sucks. And I just spent 60 bucks, which is the bigger ripoff, Math or sashimi. Who knows? L.A. people, you eavesdrop and some of the conversations, you're like, I heard a woman in the grocery store, she goes, my phone is like my baby. And I was like, that's not true. Right, because phones get better every year. Babies have made little to no progress. I can go more than two minutes without looking at a baby. You know? Yeah, you never leave a phone on the stranger's doorstep. That would be insane. Yeah, if you saw a phone on your doorstep, you'd be like, oh my god, why? Someone lost it. Yeah, if you saw a baby on your doorstep, you'd be like, this was on purpose, right? It's all I'm saying. Phones are better, right? L.A. even though the way they talk, New York, there's like a togetherness. Even when you hate the people, you feel like a connection. Right? In L.A. they're just on their car all the time. In New York, you're like, you're right. We do use that excuse, you're like, I can talk to anyone in New York. I'm not really though, you're just good. You're like, 2 a.m. I can go to the bodega and just be like, how much for this pint of Ben and Jerry's? He's like 899, I'm like, you fucking piece of shit. But we're connected, you know? New Yorkers do, we do have like a way of talking, right? Where it's like, the ADD is so, it could come off as rude to a non-native, right? You're just walking down the street like, dude, you need to break up with that girl. Great diner, right there. You should go to that diner. I always load the strata. Dude, you need to get that abortion. Chinese one's special, right? Speaking of take-outs. That crowd was great. Very cool, I flumped the line here too, but they were forgiving, they were cool. They were little, I could tell, tens. So I couldn't really feel like I'd go into the crowd really, you know? You're a little more tense, you're not like, you can't really do crowd work, but I think that's cool. I mean, like, I'm down as a due material too. So, we'll fill it out, maybe the West Village will be a little more. We can improvise a little more there, but, you know, I'm down and just get the jokes too. And then the rest is crazy, right? So, I'm in the bodega, and this guy is like a crackhead who's giving the owner a ton of crap. And I was like, hey, is everything cool in the bodega owners? Like, oh, yeah, he's one of the good ones. He's one of the good crackheads. Is that saying no New York is back when the bodega owners and the crackheads are back like this? There's some potaco. No, was it? Oh, I am, I'm professional. Oh, well, you should probably click, because I was really not funny. Why was it not funny? Well, you were saying what the f- How is it offensive? I'm really interested in how it's offensive. I was talking about the togetherness and resilience of New York. I'm not trying to start shit here. Oh, thank you. I'm going to tell them. They were just like, wait, that's the comedian that they were talking about. Oh, really? I just over had a million comedies. She thinks I'm funny. No, he's great. I know a big group of them. How about wonderful and I would be great. Oh, no, you're not interrupting at all. You're great. You're making me feel better after that interaction. Hey, isn't that fun? You can f- and turn it around just like that. That's New York. Someone hates you. At one stop, they like you 10 feet later. I've never taken my shoes off to do comedy before. This is the- I'm going to steal a pair of Jordans on the way out. I think you got to trade up. That's my motto. Everything's a touchy issue now, isn't it? Like, they're doing a trans superhero in a Marvel movie. That's a big story. Yeah, they're doing a trans. And you know they're just patting themselves on the back. Like, we did it, guys. We did it. You know they're going to mess it up. They're so politically correct in those movies. There's going to be a supervillain like, you mutants are all freaks. Except for you, your brave. But the rest of you, ah. My cousin is trans. Yeah, and my mom was concerned for her safety. I was like, look, it's going to be okay. Being trans is a lot like being a stand-up comic. Because at first you're on to non-core like, I guess you're doing this now. But then in like three years, you're like, all right, I'll start telling people. So. Just put your time in. Pay your dues. My friend was talking about that transports-illustrated model. You know what I'm talking about? She called me like, dude, she's so hot. I can't even tell the difference. And I was like, yeah, I know you mean well, but that is a weird compliment to give a human. Like, she's, I can't believe it's not butter or some shit. But she's like, shake out this impossible burger of a android here. It was amazing. I was watching mass shooting footage on CNN, and they did, um. They show the footage, and then they, and then someone cursed and they bleeped. Is that not, is that not our country in a nutshell right now? What you're about to hear might make you very obsessed. I knew this year was fucked when, uh, when the Pope, the Pope said you got to give up trolling on the internet for Lentel. I was like, I think we're doomed. Right? Because it used to be chocolate or cigarettes. Now he's like, try to not call a stranger on Twitter or Gisrag for a few days. Can you handle that? It's hard. Are we gonna have PTSD from this? I don't know. A little, right? I feel like my PTSD is gonna be like, like, you got to zoom in and I'm gonna be like, I'm not going back to you. I'm done with it. You ever just look at your phone when you get a scam call and it says scam likely on it? I'm like, man, that's pretty impressive. It's predicting the motives of the call. I wish you would do that with every phone call. Your ex-girlfriend calls still angry. Let's put this off to a later date. I love those IRS scam calls. I got one recently. I said, hello, the guy goes, you're in a lot of trouble. I said, what happened? He goes, oh. That's how I should have known it wasn't the real IRS. I don't think the real government is like, oh shit, dude. You fucked up bad. So I said, what happened? If you don't send a seven grand immediately, I'm sending over the sheriff. The sheriff. Yeah, the sheriff. I'm like, I'm on the upper west side. Let me see if there's parking for his horse real quick. I don't know. Yeah, man. Now, you know what the scam is? I want you to go to Walgreens and buy gift cards and read the back of the code because you wired the money. They can get busted. But you read the code. They think they're all right. You should know it's not the government at that point. I don't think the real IRS is that chill. They're like, look, if you don't have seven grand in cash, we do accept asking Robbins. So we're pretty chill at the government. We like ice cream. I hooked up with a girl on the road years ago. I'm in Michigan. I'm in the hotel room after the show with her. She's chugging a giant water bottle before sleeping together. I said, hey, is everything okay? And she said, oh, I got a hydrate before. And I said, yeah, cool. I might have misrepresented myself here. This is a pretty low impact. I said, yeah, this is a pretty low impact activity. Think a leptical, not treadmill. That's an idea. And she didn't know I have to hydrate because I'm a squirtor. And I was like, oh, my God. Yeah. You never see that Gatorade commercial, right? You should. Gatorade. Is it in you? I don't know. We'll see. And she got nervous. She said, does that change anything? I said, yeah, the tip I leave house keeping. I got to bring it out. So I'm telling my friend about it. He said, how was it? I said, you know, while we were having sex, she actually slipped the finger in my butt. Oh. Yeah, and my friend said, that's the prize you. And I said, what did she complied with my request? That's the mail G spot, folks. In the butt. Some guys say, no, I've been. I've come back with good news. It's right there. Just a hand. Like, Tolstito's hand to my friend. I'm going to say, no, I'm going to say, no. I've been. I've come back with good news. Like Tolstito's hand to my friend. That much. Because some guys are like, no, that's gay. It's not gay. The buttholes for everybody. The buttholes like a Broadway show. Right? Gay is talking about it the most. But if you're a straight guy, you never go. You're missing out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I call mine wicked. That's what it is. Unless she goes in too deep, then I call it lame-ass. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right now we're hoping that people show up. Oh, I love you, man. Oh, hey, sorry, didn't interrupt. Looks like you're having a nice time. I don't think that's a big comedy. You seem like a fun person. Are you like a yogi or something? You're a yoga teacher at Holy shit. I can feel energy. She's so calm and centered and her posture is so nice. Matt, be very careful, please. You're like on the side of the thing. You good? Yeah. I'm serious, though. You're like, right on that. Okay. All right. Safety first, guys. If he dies, admit torn jokes. You know how fucking guilty I'm going to feel? I'm at his funeral. Matt died the way he wanted to. In the middle of a joke about me jacking off. His mom is like, this is the worst. This is the worst eulogy I've ever heard. Matt and I were just talking about people who like, you ever talked to someone that they've got nothing to say? They're just like, you ever see this movie and you're like, yeah, I know like, good movie. I'm like, that's it. That's all you got. I was working with a comic once and he goes to the crowd. He goes, he goes, any birthdays? And some of the crowd goes, yeah, it's my birthday and he goes, happy birthday. We're at a comedy club. That's all you got. How do you guys meet? At a yoga? She was a teacher? Yes. And you fucking went for it? That's the dream. It's a weird dream, but look. What did you say to her? You have a beautiful smile. You're lucky you're handsome. That line does not work for everybody. You a beautiful smile. Holy shit. Get away from me. That line is reserved for people with your bone structure. You know what is fun is some of these celebrities getting canceled for shit that we most of us. I'm not going to say everyone here, but at least the man I've seen porn of. Someone will say this director auditioned women for his movies and then tried to sleep with them. I don't know, that is despicable. I have masturbated to that ex-ex scenario. It was scripted. So, feel like that lets me off the hook a little. How long have you guys been together? Year and a half. You're in a half that was at a dating half? No. Work? Where do you work? We worked at an investment bank. You were an investor. I thought you were going to be like, I'm a director. She auditioned for one of my bests. And I was like, lady, you have got the goods. That's great. So, you were an investment bank. And you guys just met and after work, a party or something? Christmas party. That's where it happens man. That's where it is. Now let me explain to you why entertainers get canceled all the time. Imagine a Christmas party every night. Yeah. It is funny watching comedians get canceled for jokes that uh, worked. Do you know what I mean? The whole footage of a comedian and the jokes killing. I know like this is despicable. I'm like, how about all the people who are laughing? That's why I record all my shows now. Because if I'm going down, I'm taking all you motherfuckers with me. That's so funny when the tables have turned out. I watched too much porn. I was watching porn the other day. You had the day. I have a good job. And a Tuesday. And this woman comes on before the porn star since you guys, wouldn't you rather be with the real woman instead of at home alone jerking off? And I was like, yeah, but I got a meeting in five. I don't think I can swing it. Real women, you got to get them in the mood. It's like pre-heatin' an oven. Jack and off, it's like a microwave. It's not the same quality, but there's always time. You know? Hey, buddy, how are you? Are you passionate? What do you think? I love this. What a time. It's always going to get a neighbor heckling you and it's hot, but... Yeah, buddy, how you doing up there? Thank you, sir. Wow, he walked away. I walked the guy in his own home. I eat when I'm single the same way I jerk off in a relationship, quickly and quietly over the sink. And I get sad. I have a question for you guys. You ever think you're a sex addict and then you comment, you're like, definitely not. Turns out I'm addicted to calming everyone's in a while. It's actually pretty common. Years ago, there was this baseball player, Dumb and Young. He got really drunk and time square. He spit on a guy, pushed him, called him a fucking Jew, and the guy sued him for $10 million, and it turned out he was not a Jew. So... That guy is the real anti-Semite. He's like, what did you call me? A Jew? I will see you in a court of law. After a very uncomfortable phone call with my lawyer. Because you know. Jew. Because I'm a comedian. People like to tell me they're conspiracy theories. And as a comedian, I like them. As a Jew, it's not my favorite. Rarely, am I like, oh, you think the Holocaust was a hoax? Go on. I like what this is headed. Now, I like to really off the wall conspiracy theories. I don't like the generic ones. I like the ones that are like, Jared from Subway. I don't think he did it, man. He was framed by the big wigs at Quiznos. Now, I was reading this article on Jeffrey Epstein the other day. I don't want to divide the roof here. I think he was a pretty bad person. I don't know the consensus. A few of you look like you might have dabbled on this island. But... I'm scrolling through my phone and it just says... Have you ever read on your phone? It doesn't matter the article, there's ads. It's weird to be reading about a human trafficker and then every once in a while you're like, oh yeah, Nike, that's cool. There's at least that they work the ad into the article, right? Like, you think what Epstein did was low? Check out the prices on the new LeBronz. This is crazy. I think you date women that are like your mom, right? That's just using New York crowd. You've probably been a therapy. I think you date women who are like, I do at least, you know? Because my mom was like a very overprotective mom. I'd get sick. She would react like I had stage 4 cancer every time. And I'm looking for a woman that can match that intensity. It's almost like I'm auditioning her for the part of my mom. I'm like, I'm feeling sick and she's like, it's just a head cold. And I'm like, thanks for coming in. We're going to take this in another direction. So my mom would do this thing where she just reads me bad reviews, I guess. My mom would just call me and say, I read that awful review you got. I'm like, what are you talking about? And then I assume it's the New York Times or something. And then I look it up and I'm like, mom, trip advisor. We didn't have to look into this one. We don't have to look at what every bad review says about me. So I looked it up, obviously. It's from Naples, Florida, which is the worst week of comedy I ever did. And they give you one star reviews. Like, I had a good time in their city. One star. You guys were fucking one star. I didn't like you. And the night to stay in Naples, it was bad for everybody. It's the point. Let me read you the review. On Friday night December 14, Sam Herrel was inappropriate. I like that she gave the date like it's Pearl Harbor. We had a family event planned for good laughs. Our son, daughter-in-law, adult autistic grandson in his friend. Adult autistic grandson? I hope that's not how she refers to him in public. We'll be three for dinner tonight. Me, my husband, and our adult autistic grandson. He's like, Graham, my name is Stephen. Can you stop? Can you stop calling me that? The first two local comedians were great and the food was excellent. Then came Sam Herrel, the headliner. He was a terribly bad choice. He spoke of Olga's opinions that were not funny, degraded his and our US president. We can't even have the same US president. That's how much she hates me. I'm like, lady, it's Florida. We're all on the same sink and ship here. He degraded Naples. I did. I did. And I'll do it again too, fuck Naples. I'm not some snob. I'm just going to re-known a lot of three times. I'll go back. I'll come back as long as you're not hardly abusive as an audience. And he used autistic kids for a joke. I did not. I don't even know how I would. I just scanned the crowd. What does that, some adult autistic grandson in the house? When you get his ass up here so I can roast him. Autism style. People began to protest. No one protested. I've been doing this a long time. I've never had to set so bad that I've been like shit, they're breaking up, they're taking size. He also said he would punish the crowd by going on longer. That's... That is... All right, look. Sometimes you hate the crowd so much. You're like, I'm burning this motherfucker, big rat. I could go back and stalk my hotel room or I could ruin their lives. He could not address those without insulting the age group of retirees, telling them that they'd be dead soon. Let me elaborate. I didn't say, hi, hi, you're going to be dead soon. I said I feel bad that this shitty comedy show is one of the last things you'll ever see. So... She omitted the compassion with what I spoke. Comedy doesn't let you feel good for more than a night. I'll give you an example. I did a gig in... So this happened in 2014. I did Conan. The first time I ever did a late night, I said, did Conan. You're happy to get there. It's a big deal for you at the time, right? You're like fucking... Took me like eight years or something to get there. The next night, you go to a gig in Virginia Beach, which whatever. You show up, I'm happy to be working. I say, hey, I'm Sam, to the bartender. She goes, someone needs to replace the urinal cakes in the bathroom. I said, cool, I'm the headliner for the weekend. She goes, so no. Yeah, that's a firm no. You said, well, I can't do it. I'm a woman. I said, well, I don't know what to tell you. I feel like it's a bad look for your venue. If the guy who's faces on the poster is working behind people at the urinal, can you speed it up? I'm on in five. Okay. Obviously I bomb every show. That goes with that saying. I get off... And it's not a Naples Florida comatose bomb. It's a Virginia Beach. We drink lollile and iced teas. We're not good people, bomb. You know? So I get off stage. I turn to my left. I see a giant poster of a magician. So it gets my attention. His name is Stu. He's a handsome young magician, spiky hair, holding two dubs very seriously. And it's like, what a weird poster. I turn to my right. It's Stu in person. It felt like magic. He's at the bar and he goes rough. I was like, yeah, you could say that again. He goes, you should get hammered with me tonight. You know what? I can't think any lower. Why the fuck not? So he said what became one of my favorite sentences ever. He goes, let me tell you something about this town. I fucking run Virginia Beach. I think about that quote constantly. I was like, all right. And he goes, I'm going to show you the Virginia Beach no one talks about. And I was like, that could be any part of Virginia Beach. So I've never heard a thing about your city. I don't think most people have. And by the way, then he just takes me to the bar next door, which is a bit disappointing. I thought we were going to see some CD underbelly. I was like, I could have found this. And there's a long line. I said, let's just drink somewhere quiet. And he goes, oh, we're not waiting on line. I fucking run this town. It's like, right, I forgot. So we sort of cut in the line. People are getting pissed. Stu just give him the finger. I was like, this guy might be a lot. We get to the front of the line. The bouncers see them and immediately goes, not tonight, Stu. People know this guy. And Stu goes, you better let us in or else. And the guy just let us in. That's all it took. That was magic trick number two. We're in the bar. Stu's buying everyone drinks. We're doing shots. We're getting wasted. He starts doing magic at the bar. He's a damn good magician. It's incredible. Women are gathered around. They're owing an eye after every trick. After one of the tricks, you just grabbed one of the women and started making out with her. And I was like, holy shit, this guy might run Virginia Beach. This is impressive. Then he just lets her go and he goes, fuck this shit. Strip club. I was like, that's not really my scene. He goes, trust me. And I was like, damage Stu. We made it this far. What the hell? So we start walking to his car. To me, Stu, his friend is a designated driver. We get to his car. It's a very nice BMW that's been horribly vandalized. Stu falls to his knees and goes, no! Who would do this to me? Am I for a thought I was anyone? I've known you 47 minutes. I could give you a list of suspects right now. He's hopping and popping. He's like, why? And then he finally cheers up. And he just looks at me and he goes, we're still going. That's a car, right? We get in the car. He's cheerful on the way there. He even turns to me in the back seat and goes, you've never seen anything like a Virginia Beach strip club. And then we walked in. I was like, it looks a lot like Tampa. I missed my brother. We're greeted by this gorgeous stripper. She kisses him on the mouth. And I was like, who is this guy? And he said, this is my girlfriend. I was like, oh, Stu, you loveable sleaze. I've known you for like an hour and a half. I watch you cheat and I've met your girlfriend. I hope that when she busts him cheating, he at least handles her like a magician. She finds some cocktail napkin. Who is Denise? You look, let me see that. Magic. She's like, damn it, Stu. That was kind of cool. We get wrecked. To me, Stu, the stripper, the designated driver, all of us were bombs. I had to cab it home. Horrible morning, hung over his hell. A week later, I told this story on a podcast, not thinking about it, all right? A week after that, my phone vibrates. It just says, Stu. And I panic. I don't remember saving this nothing. I panic again because I don't remember saving the picture that pops up, Stu holding two dubs. I'm like, what is that? So I press ignore, he texts me, pick up motherfucker. Hey, Stu, you made me sound like a piece of shit on that podcast and I said, no, I didn't. I made you sound cool and he goes, true. That's all it took. That's how forgiving he was. I actually felt bad. Anyway, years later, I find myself on TripAdvisor, because of my mom. And I'm looking up bad reviews I got. There's a few of them. So I start looking up some of my comedian friends. I get some bad reviews too. I don't know why, but I thought to look up still. And he's got some bad reviews, believe it or not. One just said, one star, Stu bombed our corporate event. Who will not have back and I was like, hell, no, Stu deserves better. So I left my own review. I just wrote five stars. This motherfucker runs Virginia Beach. Thank you so much, guy. Thank you for coming out. Thank you so much. Did we get it? Right it. Whoa! Oh shit! Hell yeah! This fucking rule! We're cutting in between, we'll see. I'm thinking of a special and everyone thinks that it's lit. Oh, down to earth guy! Red and up to sea mud! I don't like it. It's just me, I'm the guy. I don't like him summarizing our art like this. We're frauds!

 For those of you who do not know me, I grew up in a very religious household, with a very religious black mother that associated God with everything. Her favorite saying, God don't like ugly, all day every day. God don't like ugly, God don't like ugly. So I grew up thinking damn, we'll be gober going to hell. My Tyson, hell. JJ going to hell with gasoline drones on his... Woo! But just imagine if that's true, right? If that's true, God really don't like ugly. I guess that means Bismarcky is the anti-crime, right? I mean... Now come on, y'all know Bismarcky, I'm saying that's not like a bulletin tonight. You know what I'm saying? Homies so ugly he can make the onion cry, that ain't right? This is something that has to be talked about. Oh man, I like to talk about stuff that I see around my way all the time, like the drug bills, the young drug bills, y'all seeing. These are the ****, but there's people on the earth, I'm saying, not days because they sell in that poison. They're s**t in the way they dress. I'm saying they all do the same thing, go out and buy those telemate leather jackets, and they put their name on the back. Rahim clocking doodoo dumb dollars. Then they go on the corner and sell their drugs. The cops roll up. Excuse me, Rahim. Now one of y'all's s**t in me out. Where's this bump? No, no, he just said right hand. You heard it right? He said right hand on my neck. I ain't on my neck. ****, make noob. Before I go, ladies and gentlemen, it wouldn't be fun if I didn't bring out Shantay. But in order for Shantay to come out, the crowd got to be ready, and y'all got to bring out ladies and gentlemen, go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay. Go Shantay.

Shoulder-shattering.As you can see, Islam is not enough, As You can learn to achieve things. But, do that andά parliamentary. Spread consensus to Shengmia. That crocheting is correct. That might as well be... lodging? Uh, 그런데. And the toe here smells like... Not a bones..? Maiden. Well. So, change the bar. Angie Shantay. Go Shantay. Man, look at the bones.うts. You do the time with the girl. La la la la. Cut my music off, okay? No, you did not say no to Shantan for all these people, okay? And for my fans, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, scandal.

Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Don't you know I'm the captain sergeant and the head lieutenant of the fashion police? I'll have you locked up dressing like that. And I don't know why you think you cue or something like that because you ain't, okay? Just between me and you, you ugly. As a matter of fact, you so ugly that when you cry, your kids gonna in the back of your head because they scared to come down your face, okay? No. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. How dare you say no to Sean Tec. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank you for having me. My name is Sean Tec and it's all about me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

 I'm gonna tell you that the bar north is real loud, John. Yeah! Yeah! Everybody talking about fucking, man. I don't know, magic, that shit, I ain't no. I ain't down with OPP, HIV, I ain't down with shit. But the brother was brave, because I don't care what you say. Magic came out and told everybody, I got it. That was brave. I don't give a fuck. What you say? I don't care. Because the nigga like me would have never told. I could have been three pounds. Now I ain't shit wrong with me. No, that's no wrong, nigga. I'm fucking with that dick Gregory, but ain't. I ain't shit wrong with me. I know, no, I ain't even safe to fuck no more, man. You can die fucking ain't nothing worth dying for. I can't think of shit I'd die for. If a motherfucker pulled a gun, my mother'd be like, hey, what'd she do? She fuck with your money? I'm sorry, mama, you got to go. You pray all the time, you're going to have a stop crime. I'm not pushing, they're gonna send me to that desert storm. Niggas is a storm over here, fuck that. I'm not dying for nobody. And white people try to trick you. Giving your life in your country, hey, that's the greatest thing you can do. That's bullshit. Remember the coward lives to tell how that brave motherfucker got killed. He ran after cannons and then I ran home. With my check, I'm not dying for nobody. I will write a book about it called going like a motherfucker. Ain't shit worth dying over, man. I'm not pushing. That's why I could never have a job. I was expected to give my life like a secret service agent got a jumper from the president and take a bullet. I could see me my first day at work. I had to put something wrong. What a president? That motherfucker laying in the street. Will you act behind the truck? Niggas? Shit. I'm not dying for nobody because I want to get paid. I don't know about you. I want to be rich. Whatever you got to do to make money long as you don't hurt nobody is fine with me. Like everybody talking about James Worthy, the law saying it's like, we got busted in the motel with two prostitutes. Ladies, how many of you would leave him for that? That's what I thought. That motherfucker make five million dollars a year. For five million dollars a year, James Worthy could fuck me. You understand that? Go and do what you want, James. Now you sure you don't know nobody I know, right? Two weeks later, I'd be on Oprah. Oprah, he used me. James didn't really love me. Yeah, I'm not a bush. And you got to have money to take women to rest for us. Because women go to rest for us to lose. They got their mind. They got to order from that expensive side of the menu, decide what the steak and the lobster and the dumb perillaume. Guys like to give them that little warning too, huh? Who, honey, you understand? That's the fucking side of the menu you understand that. No, no, no, no. No, no. You order from that side of the menu, somebody is fucking you understand that. I'm not saying it's you, but somebody live where you live is fucking me, you understand that? It's steak, lobster, and dick. It is a combination. That's right. I wonder that men and women at home making love, she's going, can we stop now? I'm bitch, you want them chicken wings, you keep going. And you had a doggy back, that means I'm coming back tomorrow. God damn it. Fuck, man. Because black men, black mothers are always the same, and women, they get up, they go old, they become mothers. Black mothers are all, man, when you be way down the street, your mother call your house. Black women was immersed, you runnin' house, come here, come here, you runnin' house. What you want, mama? Turn the TV. It's like, ain't you right next to that motherfucker? I hate her. Make me sick, would you say nothing? Damn. Stinky lady. Mama's stink. I don't know, man. A lot of people believe in heaven, a lot of people believe in hell, man. A lot of people do, man. Somebody asked me did I believe in heaven and hell? I said, I don't know, you know, but then I was reading. I read that 100 million Africans, 100 million Africans, dig this, died in the slave trade. 100 million, man, it's only 250 million people in this country. 100 million people is more than some countries have. That'd be like, that's the third of this country, that'd be like every third motherfucker, everywhere you went, just got up and walked out, never came back. Do I believe in heaven and hell? I believe if you been black, you should, I'm actually get to go to heaven because you don't already cut, hey. That. That. That. That's cheating. She did. But then do that, man. Because I believe in Jesus, I don't want to be one of the brothers that don't believe in Jesus. But what the Bible says, the Bible is scary to see it on it. Jesus is coming back like a thief in the night. The night when you look at it, that's when you do. Most of you're fucking up. You get that knock at that motel door? Who is it? It is on my son. Woo! Girl, put your pennies on that sheet. It's not the door. I gotta go, see ya. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

 And sometime we'll show you the joy, love of Classifications, and all that accident happens We can't just come into freinds anymore說 and then cut it. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you. Oh! Thank you very much, Minneapolis. I am going to say some things tonight that by the end of the show are probably going to offend everybody here. Woo! Woo! I want you to remember that. If you find yourself starting to get tense, so I want you to just keep two things in mind to make the pills easier to swallow. The first thing is, really, at the end of the day, who the fuck am I? I'm just some random dickhead who admittedly doesn't have all the answers. Trying to figure things out as I go. I'm a curious person, I try to evolve, so my opinions change over time. So there's a good chance that a couple months from now, or maybe even a couple hours from now. I'm not going to like some of the things I say tonight. And the second arguably more important thing to keep in mind is, who the fuck are you? No matter who you think you might be, I assure you you're also just some random dickhead. Who doesn't have all the answers, trying to figure shit out as you go. And I think if we could all keep that in mind more often, we could be less triggered as society and calm the fuck down and deal with each other with a little more humility and grace. We're all just trying to figure things out. Or maybe it's too late for that. But the best way to make society a little more tolerable for those of us who remain will be to give every American a one-question quiz. Do you actually believe that a secret, satanic cabal, is controlling society from the shadows? And anybody who answers, yes, you know, we kill him. You sacrifice him to Satan and we start over. I'm just bit bummed, I don't know. Weird times are living in very conspiratorial times. I never thought I would get this bad. This is how off I was. When I recorded my last special, I had a couple conspiracy bits on there, making fun of flat-earthers and people who were worried about the lizard illuminati. And I remember being worried that if we didn't hurry up and edit that special quickly and release it fast by the time it came out, conspiracy jokes would no longer be culturally relevant. And then Q and I was like, get the fuck out of here! Hold on to your apocalypse horses. We're just getting warmed up, my friend. Didn't you hear the new one? Jesus just sent in Trump to save us from the devil. Jesus did that? Did grabbing by the pussy guy? That's who Jesus is. To have gone to the shoulder was like, get in there Donnie and fuck up those liberals. You can only hope. Interesting twist. My favorite conspiracy is from the last couple of years, are the ones that revolve around Bill Gates. A lot of Bill Gates concerned. A lot of people worried. Like after the COVID vaccine came out, there was a contingent of people online who were like, do not take that fake vaccine. Bill Gates made that. One of my first thoughts was, that's impressive for a computer program. Like I always knew he was smart, but got down. And interesting move for him to take his hands off the wheel of running a multi-billion dollar international conglomerate for a couple of days or whatever to head down to his laboratory and tinker with his evil beakers. Cook up some poison. They're like, yeah, don't take this vaccine. It's not real. It's poison. It's part of an agenda 21 depopulation program designed to kill millions of people. When I first heard that, I immediately thought this can't be real. Because that is simply too good to be true. That's a dream. I would love to put Bill Gates in charge with mass extermination event. He's a smart guy. I feel like he's getting rid of the right people. I think we should encourage him online to start a hashtag movement. Just let Bill kill. Release the Kraken. I just think of bills in charge. We're not going to be losing anybody important. We're not going to be losing business leaders and professors and doctors. We're going to be losing people who live in that sweet spot where Holocaust denial meets meth. We don't need those people. Robots are about to take their jobs. I think we should have a new Holocaust. Hear me out. A different one. A fun one. We're only going to kill Holocaust deniers. When they're all dead, we're going to act like it never happened. Hey. Finally, a Holocaust. We'll go about. There are a lot of conspiracies. A lot of conspiracies around the vaccine. I don't believe all of them. I make fun of a lot of conspiracies. I love some of the vaccine related ones. I don't think they should be mandated. There's a reason to be skeptical. Some people think that's crazy. Seriously? You don't think we can blindly and implicitly trust Big Pharma? What would they stand to gain from lying to us? I don't know hundreds of billions of dollars of corporate profits? When have they ever done something like, I don't know, collude with the FDA and intentionally manipulate data to do the exact thing you're talking about? I don't know. The opioid crisis. Shut the fuck up, conspiracy freak. That was a couple days ago. They're different now. We can trust them. I don't think we should trust them. There's a reason to be skeptical. That being said, most of the people I know who have chosen not to get the vaccine while there are good reasons not to do so, they have not employed those reasons. They've tended to fall in one of two camps. My observance. There's the live for your die. Don't try to make camp. Or the, I've never cared about my health before, a day in my life. But now, I'm a nutritionist camp. The live for your die argument is pretty simple. It's just, I don't want the government telling me how to live my life. And I appreciate the sentiment. But I do want the government kind of telling us how to live our lives. To some degree, because if they don't tell us how to live our lives at all, that's anarchy. An anarchy is for fucking psychopaths. Might sound fun as a fantasy, not in real life. Anarchy would only kind of work for young, fit dudes with no kids to worry about. Living in an easily defendable compound, who are very proficient with weapons, have a large supply of ammunition, ton of dry goods, tons of access to clean water. And even those guys after a few weeks are going to be like, this is fucking crazy! We should have police or hospitals or something. I just saw a bunch of guys I used to play softball with, and now there's some kind of, they're in a barbecue rape gang. I don't even know what that is. But that's what their flag set. It'd be real dystopian, real quick. Now we gotta have some rules. Rules is how you have a society. It's how you have civilization and nice things. It's the social contract. The bad part of the social contract is that we too often have to follow the illogical and manipulative laws passed by self-centered, ego-miniacal, just dipshit to care more about election cycle optics than to do about the average person. And that sucks because those people are cunts. That's not the fun part of the social contract. The fun part is to no longer have to live in caves and shit on rocks, and hunt deer with sharp sticks, and always worry about a larger biped coming over and taking our food and fucking our partner and or us. And I think the pros outweigh the cons overall. And whether or not you've taken a vaccine, I don't know how more or less free it makes you. You know, whether you took it or not, you're still a follower. Everybody in this room is a follower. If you weren't, you would have died long time ago, probably in a car wreck. You can suck my dickstop sign. I stop when I want. No one bosses me. Just blowing through intersections all willy-nilly, like some misguided William Wallace. The lights always green when you're fused to kneel. Freedom! Nah, that's crazy talk. The nutrition argument is my favorite one though. I'm not going to put something in my body, but I don't understand. When I've heard some version of that, I just think, I think I have a gas station hot dogs if you have. It's like, shut the fuck up. There's nothing more American than putting shit in your body you don't understand. We're a nation of consumerism and processed food. That's what we do. You know how much fruits and fruit loops? Not a drop. Put down the hatchet goes because cancer never takes it so good. I love to put things in my body. I don't fully understand. What is that? Probably Molly? You look trustworthy. My body's a temple and your god is Ronald McDonald. I never cared about your health. I hate now that jokes like those get politicized oftentimes. I buy certain segments of society, very lazy binary thinkers. You have an opinion on one subject that might read political and they think they know you. They want to put you all the way in the left or all the way in the right. There's no other option and just fill in the blanks and what you may believe elsewhere. I just, oh, okay. So you think there's some validity to science, huh? Looks like you want us to follow some laws. All right, boot liquor. I bet you want to take our guns too. Don't you? You call me piece of shit. What are you talking about? I didn't say any of that. Actually, I'm a gun owner. I like to go do a little target practice. If I'm going to be honest, sometimes I do like to pretend that the targets are people I don't care for like yourself. Relaxes me. Oh, so that's you are going to have your pew-pews feel like a big man. Home of phobic right wing nut job. Home of what? Because I like guns. I don't like the gaze that's insane. Now, I'm very pro LGBTQIA+. I think, you know, people should be able to love. Whoever they want to love. But don't fuck kids. Love adults. Whoever they want to love. That's all good. Oh, so that's you are. Liber legend. And no rules for anyone. You and Tifa motherfucker. What? No, I like some rules. I'm pro law enforcement, pro military. Yeah. What the fuck are you? You're not playing the game right. You have to be Fox or CNN. That's it. Now, you can hate both those options and I do. I just not a big fan of the Republicans or the Democrats right now. Fun will be completely honest. I don't feel like either side represents me. I feel like a lot of people think that. For me, you know, like with the left, there's just too much concern about the most easily outraged members of society. Right? You can take anything too far including empathy. I don't want to, you know, just marginalize anybody. I also don't want to walk on egg shells in this weird tense, puckered up society where everyone's worried about saying the wrong thing. Because that's a great way to suck the fucking joy out of life for everyone. And on the right, there's just too much religious thinking for me. Don't like religion and politics. Never will. For one very simple reason. Right? For me, the reason is no one can ever agree on what SkyDaddy wants. It's just all over the place. That's the problem. Like just with Christianity, there's over 45,000 different denominations of just this one religion in the world today. Over 45,000 different groups of people who think another 45,000 plus different groups of people, reading the same book, worshiping the same God, are fricking it up a little bit. And that doesn't include the rogue outliers, just random dudes in their cabins around the world who think they're the only one who gets it. I'm so sorry, no one else understands your glory, Lord. I wish more people could get it, like my landlord, my ex-wife, if they could cut me some fucking slack. I don't have a job because I'm focusing on your glory. Basin laws on religious thinking, like you might as well just base laws on which rooster wins in a cock fight. It's absurd. And if you don't like that because maybe you are a religious person, you don't think that's fair. Well, would you like it if we had a politician who was not necessarily religious but spiritual, who channeled the spirit world to make major decisions? Because for me, it's the same kind of thing. I don't think many people would be comfortable with that. Some politician coming out and be like, all right, everybody, we're going to war with Russia. I know it's a big decision. And at first I was against it. But last night, I held a science. And I was able to channel the spirits of George Washington and Julius Caesar and some guy named Todd. Julius and George and Todd told me to push that fucking button, so here we are. And I know some people will be offended by that comparison. They're like, you just presented an extreme example. And most people who are religious are moderate in their beliefs. That doesn't make me feel better. Like moderate versus extreme in that spectrum. To me, that's like saying, like, hey man, I don't appreciate you questioning my decision-making abilities. I don't make all my decisions while I'm high on fucking crack. I smoke crack on Easter and Christmas. And the rest of the year, I just kind of think about hitting that pipe. I do understand that anyone who didn't care for my first analogy did like that a second. Except that. And the left, just worrying about the most fragile members of society. I'm all for empathy. I'm all for compassion. I just don't want to be overly sensitive when it comes to language selfishly, because then I can't do this fucking job anymore. Every joke I tell has a victim. I mean, that seemed like it, but they're all offensive. If you break them down, even the ones that don't seem offensive. I'll prove it by trying to tell the same bit twice. I'll tell it the first way, just as I normally would, not worrying about someone's going to be upset or not. And then I'll try to tell the same story again, but making sure that no one could be triggered or bothered by any of the language I use. And we'll see which kind of comedy you prefer. Which makes me a little nervous here. You fucking soft Minneapolis motherfuckers. We'll try it anyway. Way number one, right? A lot of times when I'm standing in a line, I find myself getting very frustrated, because I feel like the other people in the line are fucking it up to some degree. They don't have the distance right between themselves and the next person in line. That's how you do a line correctly. About three feet keeps it nice and tight. Not to lose, not to crowd it. You get more than three feet. Now you're causing a lot of unnecessary stress and confusion for everyone behind you. They're not sure they're in line anymore. They're falling into different states of existential crisis. What is a line if there's no rules? What is life with no one respects lines? Who am I? I should take my clothes off. Shit on the counter. We should fucking burn this place. Nothing matters. Anything less than three feet now the person directly in front of you is overly concerned with being murdered. And that's not fair. Maybe you want to stand three feet apart, but you're not spatially inclined. All right, well I've come up with a training regiment for you to help you get it. Every time you go in public until it becomes second nature, just carry around a heavy old school wooden yardstick. It's a nice visual representation of three feet. It's about like this mic stand if I push it down to the middle. It's about like here. I'm just walking around with it. This is weird, but it's not illegal. And it's an excellent confidence booster. I feel way more confident now than I felt ten seconds ago. Less worried about these people in the front. And then when you get to the back of the line that you want to be a part of, I want you to stop and assess the situation. Put one end of that stick against your waist. And then just march forward, slowing, skipping. Until you tap that last person in the back and that's when you stop. And they're going to have questions and concerns. What the hell is wrong with you? Just stand your ground, don't let them bully you. Just calmly explain yourself. I'm trying to get better. And if they still hassle you at that point when you have to beat him with that stick, you don't let them impede your personal growth. But three feet, not inches. That's very important. Don't pull a spinal tap. Don't be that close to the ass of the person in front of you. Don't be so close to just a casual hip stretch. You're just trying to open up your root chakra. Now you're rubbing your mayor of fun town up against their not-now button. Don't be ringing their not yet, Bell. Not yet, go round to the front. See if you're welcome to the living room and spend some time there. Get to know the family, find out what they like. Come back in 45 minutes, find out if that back door escaped open enough, Bell. That last part was confusing. Don't even worry about it. You're not ready for that joke. Your loophole is pure. I didn't think that was too offensive, right? No one died. But every part of that bit was offensive. And frankly, I'm ashamed of you for laughing at it. I'll try it again in the second way where I'm not going to possibly bother anybody with my language. A lot of times when I'm standing in line, I get really frustrated. Because I feel like the other people in line are fucking it up to various... Who, apologize for the profanity? I do know that a lot of our vulgar vernacular has a very kind of misogynistic history and bringing it up is very traumatic for a lot of people. I apologize. I should have said freaking. No, I shouldn't have. Replacement words are actually more offensive than the very vulgarity they represent by forcing you to complete that traumatic circuit in your head. And I apologize for putting that on you. I was going to talk about space and line, but really, who died and made me the king of lines? No one. If I have a problem with the amount of space other people need in line, then I need to see therapy for my anger issues. Maybe some people need more than three feet because they have social anxiety, which is very real. Maybe some people need less than three feet because they're lonely and crave human contact. And I'm going to push them away. Why do I build such walls around my heart? I'm ashamed to admit it, but I was actually going to advocate for you to carry a large stick around in public in a menacing fashion. How triggering for the victims of stick attacks. No, sir. I mean, no, ma'am. I mean, no them. It's just too complicated to talk that way. I would rather burn you motherfuckers alive than have to do comedy like that. But these two parties we have, and we essentially do have a two party system. How did we get stuck with these two ideological dumpster fires? And I hate that the two party system seems to have created a sports rivalry, mindless tribalism vibe in American politics. Which is great for sports. Mindless tribalism is built for a sports rivalry. That's what we're supposed to get that out of our system. Be part of a team, cheer, boo, have all that emotion. Do it in a place where the stakes don't matter. That's the beauty of sports. Right? It doesn't actually matter who wins or loses. Right? The results are actually pretty trivial. Right? It's easy. You don't have to think much about it because it doesn't matter. You just go, you root for this jersey, you boo for that jersey, you high five this tip shit, you drink this beer, you have a great fucking time. Go fight win. Right? Because it's not like if your team loses, your property taxes go up. There's nothing real right in on it. You're not like, come on, one more touchdown on my brother Gary. He can marry his boyfriend. Let's fucking go. This means everything. Oh, it doesn't mean anything. But in politics, like the stakes are actually important, but people treat it like a sports rivalry. You know, I feel like a lot of the people doing the loudest yelling, especially online. They don't even understand their own party's platform. It's not about logic for them. It's about being part of a team. They just want to cheer and boo. Induce them, Yelly. Why do I root for team Democrat? Well, because they're tolerance. And I am very tolerant. No one has ever been as tolerant as we are. We have the most tolerant team of all time. We tolerate literally everything. Except anyone who even slightly disagrees with us on one issue will fucking burn your shit to the ground. If you don't bend the knee to tolerance. Go fight, win. Why do I root for team Republican? Well, for starters, because I don't hate America. Lib Tard, listen to fuck up. I love this team, because this team loves everything I do. Aggressive bumper stickers. Kid Rock. Flags on the back of my truck. Feels like I'm in a parade. Very emotional. And I feel like this supposed culture war we're having with these two teams is largely media manufactured. Right? It serves politicians and mass media to have these simple narratives and put us into two voting and marketing camps. Doesn't do much good for families and neighbors and friends. But it's great for, you know, those kind of systems. And I just don't buy it. I just don't think that there really is a culture war because if there was these two teams, then most of the people you meet should be on one of these two teams. But I don't find that to be the case. I find most of this to be somewhere in the middle. We all of our card art beliefs, take a little from here, take a little from there, build our own individual identity. And you don't hear enough about that on the news because it's not a sexy, simple narrative. But I know people who identify as Democrat, who are also gun owners and pro law enforcement. I pro law enforcement, but you never hear about that on that side. Maybe there's people who have thought about how they might feel a little hypocritical. If they were adamantly against both those two things, and then somebody broke into their house, and they were unarmed and scared. And they had to call the people they supposedly hate, and really hope they bring the weapons they also supposedly hate. Because who else is going to call in that situation? They're vegan pacifist friends to come over and verbally deescalate shit. Don't kid yourself. Everyone wants to show for us sometimes. I also know people who identify as conservative, Republican, who are pro choice. You don't hear about that a lot. Maybe there are just people who used to be pro-life, but then one night they had to change their heart. One night they forgot to pull out like everybody else and shit got real. And they got harder to stand on that moral high ground. And they were just like, oh my heck, I'm in quite a pickle now. How did I get here? I do love Jesus, but if I'm going to be honest with myself for a few seconds, I did love that pussy a little bit more. I just felt so good, I didn't want to leave. Now what do I do? On the one hand, yes, Jesus does love all the little children this I know. But on the other, he also forgives, so maybe fuck this one. Another brings a comedy crowd together like abortion. Another puts the F in fun like fetus, right? Speaking of abortion, what kind of handmaid's tail shit is going on in this country? Glory be to Gilead. Blessed be the fruits. Starting Texas, this old wave of legislation. When they decided, these guys down there decided that there be no abortion after six weeks, even in cases of rape and incest. And no matter which side of the argument you stand on, doesn't that feel a little unfair that it is always dudes, deciding to regulate women's reproductive rights every single time without exception? And it never even feels like the right kind of dudes. Like a lot of times when I see a politician who is staunchly pro-life, one of the vibes he kind of gives me, one of the thoughts I have is, he doesn't eat pussy. Because it scares him. He's skittish about it. Fills him with all these shameful dirty thoughts and he wants to punish and regulate that pussy. Crazy thing to me about the Texas situation is the guy who signed the Bill into law, Governor Abbott. I don't know how much you know about him, but he's been paralyzed from the waist down for over 30 years. Is that absurdity or irony? The guy who signed the most controversial sexual consequence Bill into law in decades can't stand up and fuck. Feels like a dick move, a limp dick move, technically. It just feels unfair because he's never going to have to deal with the consequences, never going to blow back on him. I feel like the moral equivalent would be if I was Governor, and I signed the Bill into law, raising the angle of the handicap ramp from about five degrees to around 60. And then if anybody gets upset, I can just be like, I'm gonna fuck like a walk. Not my fault, you want more careful in that trampoline? I know that one gets sad the longer you think about it. Do you know how he got paralyzed? He was jogging. He was out jogging randomly, so over 30 years go down in Texas, and he was running under a large oak tree, and it randomly just split in half, and half of it fell on him. True story. Even God hates this motherfucker. I mean, that's a sign. That's a sign. I know for a lot of people, it doesn't matter what jokes they make about this, because it's not a joking issue. It's a matter of life. Right, and six weeks was chosen because that's when a fetus begins to develop a brain. And that's true, and that's a powerful emotional argument. But it's not a complete argument. Yes, fetus does have a brain at six weeks. But not a good one. It has a little bug brain. No more capable of advanced intellectual decision making than say the trillions of sperm cells lost in buttholes every year, but no one talks about that. That is tragic. What a dirty trick. Shot into a dark tunnel to complete their one life mission. And find that sweet, sweet egg. But see nothing but shit, literally. Spending their final confused moments in lube and numbing cream. I can't feel my tail, John, I'm scared. That's how you lighten up a heavy topic, butthole jokes. It's old cat skills trick. Penny Youngman taught me that one. Huge butthole guy. I know this is a very emotional topic for many. I feel like it becomes overly emotional for some because the pro-choice side of the argument is chronically misrepresented. It gets presented as a pro-obortion argument, which is very different. You can be morally opposed to abortion and be pro-choice. You just want to enforce your morality on the body or circumstance of a stranger. It's a pro-freedom argument. Let people choose for themselves. Pro-obortion highly unlikely, you're ever going to meet somebody who's legitimately pro-abortion. That's a serial killer. With an especially dark target demographic. Imagine how horrific that would look in real life. That would be like, there's some lady that you've known for a while, and you know that she never wanted kids, like, adamantly against kids. You haven't seen it a little while. She goes back in your life very visibly pregnant. And you're just curious. You're like, oh, hey, Susan, I... Congrats, I guess. I didn't think you ever wanted to have children. And then she just says something cartoonishly evil. I don't. Mama just gets so hungry. Then you notice a row of tiny skeletons on her necklace. Just... Mama's trophies. Yeah, that was dark, even for me. I know. Also not real. That's some 1950s propaganda poster shit. Last thing I'll say about this is I do think most people on the pro-life side of the argument have their heart and the right place. They're fighting for life, hard to find something more noble than that. I just think it tends to come from a religious place, which again is not supposed to enter the political arena in this world. But everybody at right? But everybody I know who is staunchly pro-life, right? Their belief system boils down to some version of, because God said, thou shalt not kill. Like, yes, the Christian God did say that. But also said, so much other shit that no one ever pays attention to. And that's what's frustrating. Because I'm a student of the Bible, and God said that in the old Wizard D. and D. section. Which was supposed to have been replaced by the Newer section in particular to the Gospels. Messages in there that everyone ignores. Like in the book of Matthew, one of the messages chronically ignored it says, if you're hand-lead you into sin, you're supposed to cut it off and cast it out. I see a lot of fucking hands here tonight. I bet a lot of those fingers have typed out porn hub with the equivalent more than once. How serious are we about these rules? And then people say, well, that part's interpretive. That's not literal. That's interpretive. No, should all be literal or all be interpretive. So people can stop bending, you know, little parts to their kind of wills and agenda. So maybe if the new stuff is interpretive, well, maybe the old stuff is too. Maybe the tone of the commandments got lost on the righty. Maybe they weren't so authoritative. Maybe they were actually delivered, you know, more whimsically. Something like, thou shalt not kill fucking Will and Nilly? Well, yeah, sometimes a motherfucker has to die. Serial killers pedophiles left their bodies, hit their floor. Left their pockets, hit their floor. Last book of drowning pool. You know, when I was putting together new hour material, I thought that that last piece would be the most offensive. Now it's wrong. This next piece is. Which was confusing to me at first because I understand what that last segment of material is polarizing. But this next section, I was like, what's wrong with it? But then I remembered how emotional and illogical people can be with animals. You start talking about killing cute innocent forest creatures and people get uptight. So I don't hear many comics do bits about hunting because it makes people too sad. But it shouldn't. Hunting is a kindness, really is. Everyone should be in favor of ethical hunting. I don't care if you're a vegan animal rights activist. You should cheer when a deer takes a bullet to the head. You really should. If you don't, you're thinking with your heart and not your brain. You're not thinking about what happens when the bullet misses. I'll tell you what doesn't happen. That deer doesn't scamper further into the forest to have a dizzy jamboree with his closest pals. Just so, bam, no cesarees, no simple bell, no cesarees. Now don't forget about your worry and your strife. Do you have a lot to be strifeed about? Hunting is a nice thing to do to animals. Do you remember that last time you saw a really old deer out in the woods limping around and joining its golden years? Nope, because they don't exist. If a hunter doesn't take a deer out, something worse will. A more aggressive predator or starvation or disease. I've seen hunters do a lot of things. I've never seen them do something as cruel as what happens in so much of the rest of nature. I've never seen a hunter shoot a deer in the lake. Instead of taking a second to fire a second quick kill shot to put the deer out of its misery, instead just set that rifle down. Smile, here we fucking go, deer. Just decide to toy with it for a while. Just chase it down as the deer limps away in terror. Maybe grab it by the antlers, punch it in the head to stun it. Take a bite out of its neck. But then not kill it so it can enjoy warm blood a couple hours later. Hunters don't do that, but bears do. People don't get mad at bears. They're like, yeah, they're part of nature. So are we, and we're way better than bears. I used to try and tell a story about one of my first hunting trips early on when I was doing stand-up. And I stopped, because I made people too sad. But now I've been doing this for a long time and I don't fucking carry more. You should enjoy this story. It's a happy story. If you find yourself start to get sad at any point. Just remember it has a happy ending. The deer was delicious. I was 12 years old and I was hunting with my grandpa Ward. Papa Ward taught me how to hunt. He's a great dude, good hunter. Yeah, he's a great guy. And he liked to do a kind of hunting that a lot of other hunters do frown upon. It's illegal in a lot of everywhere. It's illegal everywhere. He called it truck hunting. It's a really nice way to hunt. It's very comfortable. You just drive along the road and you try to find a deer on the same road that you're on. And ideally, you just kind of shoot it on the road, throw it in the back of the truck and keep it moving. There's no hiking, no weather, no tree stand bullshit. Your climate control, comfy seat. You got the radio. There's a small chance you'll shoot another motorist, but hey, life's risky. And we're looking for white tail bucks on this old logging road in Central Idaho. And we're not seeing anything. It's almost lunchtime we're about to give up. They're probably better down for the day. But then right before we call it, it was beautiful. This majestic white tail buck comes from the brush underneath road about 70 yards down the road. It just comes up from the brush, stops in the middle of the road and looks at us and stays there. Like it knew what we wanted it to do. And grandpa slowed the truck to a stop. He's like, Danny, get your shot. Get your shot. So I start to get out of the truck and line up my shot. As I'm doing that, oh my god, so much better. A doe now comes from the same brush where the buck came from. Comes up onto the road, stands right behind the buck and stops. They know each other. My husband and wife, they're a mating pair. I know, it was beautiful. I take a second to admire it before I start to get my shot set up again. And then before I pull the trigger, it was so incredible. Twin Fonds. I write, how lucky are we to win this mess? The whole family's there, dad, mom and the kids. They're staring at me, I'm staring to dad through the scope of my rifle. And I felt like we shared a moment of mutual respect. Before I pulled the trigger and it was best case scenario. I shot him right in the eye, literally blew his brains out on his family and they scampered away in tear. Don't focus on that part. Focus on the part where dad died a clean painless death. I felt like if he knew what was happening to him and could have communicated to me before the bullet hit him, he would have said, you're a great kid and you're doing the right thing. Thank you for the kindness. I feel like his kids as they scampered away with his blood on them, if they would have understood what was happening, they would have been like, I'm gonna send him my dad so well. But for some reason this story makes people sad. I even had one lady one time say to me after hearing this story, she said, what that do you ever do to you? Well, I'm glad you're sitting down because there's more to this tale. I used to try and tell that first story on stage, but I never told this next part. I've never talked about this on the podcast. I just haven't been ready. The wound was too fresh, you know, but I've done a lot of therapy and I feel like I can discuss it now. But I used to have an older brother. His name was Richard Bartholomew. I knew him as Dick, Dick Becommans. A very true story. His older brother and growing up I worship Dick. For me the son rose and said on Dick, and that dear we found that day was no accident. We've been tracking that dear. It was revenge killing. Because six months earlier that same dear raped my brother, Dick, to death. Oh, you didn't know they could do that. Wait the fuck up Minneapolis in your liberal bubble with your fake news. The whole report on an epidemic of dear rape deaths. You have it known terror until a horny buck is kicked in your front door. Which can take two to three hours because it's less of a kick and more of a steady whittling. With their little hateful hooves and they whittle and they whittle. And they build the tension and they rip off your pants. Which can take a couple of days because they don't have fingers or thumbs. And it's less of a rip in more of us just a kind of a clumsy slapping really. A lot of people get tired of being slapped and they take their own pants off to get it over with. Which leads to a lot of victim shaming which is not okay. I feel like a lot of you don't believe this story. I get it. It's a lot taken. I bet I know what you're hung up on. I bet you're thinking like, okay, so let me get this right. So this deer gets in your house and Dickie B is naked on the floor. At least from the waist down. But he's laying down. How would a deer with this limited range of motion and flexibility be able to kind of missionary position your brother? Like wouldn't he have to say help out maybe stand up and seductively present himself to be mounted? Yeah, he did do that. It's called Stockholm syndrome. People fall in love with their captors. Doesn't make a less tragic. I still feel like a lot of you people don't believe this story. I get it. I get it. I bet I know what you're hung up on now. I bet you think, okay, even if all of that happened, which is insane. How would it? How would the deer kill your brother? I watch a lot of nature documentaries and I have the exact size of a deer penis memorized. And I know for a fact they cannot kill a human grown male through sodomy. Okay, he didn't die literally. He died figuratively when he left our family to start a new life in the woods with his deer lever, which was tough for me to emotionally process. R.I.P. Dickie B. M.S. your brother. I know that was a lot. I want you to know that I know that was a lot. I know that joke's not for everyone. I run a lot of these stories by my wife, Lindsay, before I tell them on stage. And I told that story to Lindsay before I ever told a to an audience. And I believe her exact feedback was, that's fucking dumb. Tough but fair, okay? Maybe that's not the funniest story you've ever heard, but I don't just grade new comedic top. I have two topics on just humor. I have two categories. How funny is it? And how original is it? And maybe that's not the funniest story. But I dare you to find another comic out there telling a long form story about his fake brother being fake raped by a fake deer to fake death. Passing value for me. I was just trying to talk about hunting and I got sidetracked. I was just trying to talk about it. You do have to be careful though talking about animals. People get so sensitive. Like a lot of people don't like it if you admit that you just don't care about a lot of endangered species. Because they don't. I like some. I like the strong ones. The weak ones are supposed to die. That's what nature is always done. But we just get too sad now. We get too emotional with animals. We become like weird hoarders. Don't touch that sloth. I might want to look at it in 30 years. No, fucks lost. Let them die. We're wasting a lot of money on sloths right now. They could go to cancer research or ending homelessness. They wouldn't keep surviving if we didn't keep subsidizing them and propping them up. I don't believe they ever survived on their own in the first place. Have you ever fucking seen a sloth? There's no way that thing's important to the environment. If we let them all die tomorrow, I promise you we're never going to regret it. We're not going to panic 20 years from now. I'm like, oh no! What have we done? Look at these trees. They have way too many leaves on them. If only we still had a creature that could eat a few of the leaves but never that many because it's so slow and pathetic. But now we're just stuck with this lush foliage forever. A lot of people get real worked up about sea turtles. We're going to save these sea turtles. Sea turtles raped my brother to death. My other brother, I do. You step through your brothers. Now I like sea turtles. I do. And they're important. They're important to the environment. They're not just cute. They are important. I do hope we can keep sea turtles around. But here's the thing. I'm going to be honest with you guys. I feel like I'm in a safe space. It's not the most likeable thing to say. That's how I feel my heart. I don't hate sea turtles. I just don't like them as much as plastic straws. I have sensitive teeth. I didn't ask for it. It's my cross-bear. And I like an ice mocha. And if I don't use a straw, the ice... Oh, it will hit my teeth and it is very out cheese. Oh, you betcha. And some people are like, why can't you just use a paper straw? Because those aren't real. Those are practical jokes in straw form. Those are brain aneurysm starter kits. But I hope we can keep sea turtles around. I'm not going to do anything to try, but I hope you guys do. There's actually only one endangered species that I'm truly just rooting for it to finally be just totally dead. Just extinct. That's a northern spotted owl. Fuck them. They've done enough. We don't need them anymore. Right? They've caused enough problems. In the Pacific Northwest, up to 130,000 logging jobs gone, not replaced to save this owl. Right? Little towns like mine destroyed when the sawmill was not rebuilt. By conservationists who want to save this owl who are just thinking with their hearts and not their brains. Because all of that was done, they're still going to die. And everybody where I grew up knew that many years ago. They're like, why are we wasting this money? There are other better owls in the same woods. The look almost identical to this piece of shit. That we don't have to do anything to try and keep them around. Right? The spotted owl, it just outlived its time. Had a good run, now it's over. It just refused to evolve. It's just too pathetic and needy. Like it only wants to nest an old growth Douglas fir pine trees. That's why you can't log around it. It only wants these old trees. The branches have to be broken and the right angles towards the top. And then this little fucking dip shit will be grudgingly nests there. I get to live there. Ugh! And then it wants 20 square miles of hunting territory around this tree where it'll eat one kind of mouse and one kind of squirrel. Unless a competitive predator also wants that mouse and squirrel. And then this thing basically gives up and dies. I'm even wanting now! I don't even think it's strong enough to make a proper whew! I bet it sounds more like a whew! Stop it! Yeah, now this thing is being taken out by nature. Right? Doing what we were unwilling to do. In the funniest extinction event I've ever heard of. Mother Nature has chosen to send another owl into kill this owl. Last couple decades the Eastern Bard owl has started to migrate from the East Coast to the Pacific Northwest. Never did that before. No human intervention. It's like it just heard, finally, through the Al Greyfine. But there was a bunch of easy territory in the Northwest being poorly guarded by a bunch of emo sad boy owls. A bunch of weak anemic owls, depressed, living in trees, you know, troubled relationships with their parents, unrealistic romantic expectations. Still painting their fingernails black and listening to dashboard confessional. Who I do actually like. And these Bard owls, these things are hardy. They are strong. They'll nest anywhere. They'll live in the Charlie Brown Christmas tree. They don't go fuck. They'll eat anything. They're not picky. They could probably live mostly on Skittles Rappers and Mountain Dewcans. And they're powerful. They're hardy. I don't think they make a whew! Either it's more like a Rick Flair like a whew! Whew! These Bard owls are coming off the top rope. And they're not just pushing the spotter out of their territory the last couple years, environmentalists figured out that they're actually literally fucking them into extinction. They just figured out that the male Bard owl can successfully mate with the female spotter owl. And his genes are so much more dominant and expressive that the baby owlets are essentially all Bard ow. These motherfuckers are sky Vikings. And some people get sad about this story. I think it's a great cautionary tale for our species to learn from. If you want to continue to thrive on this planet, we have to work hard, adapt, evolve, or we're going to get fucked on off of it. Whew! Now, feel a Bard ow. Alright, I don't want you guys to think I'm a psychopath when it comes to animals. So, do like... Now, I want to share a nice animal story. Because I also can be an emotional illogical thinker when it comes to certain species. Like dogs. I am definitely a doodles. I'm a weird dog person. For sure. I love Penny Pooper and Ginger Bell so much. And I love them so much. And my wife Lindsey loves them, you know, too. But I've actually become the weirder dog person than her. I never expected that. Going into it. Like, I was more worried about her when we got them. And I tried to discuss some ground rules. I'm like, okay, we're gonna get some dogs. But they're not gonna ever sleep in our bed. That's just for us. We don't need to buy them a ton of toys. They can't count. They don't know how many toys they have. And we're never gonna dress them up because they're dogs, not little people. I don't think I made it five minutes into the first night of trying to create train Penny before I was the one who broke. Like, she just kept whining. And I was begging Lindsey to let her sleep with us. She's dying in there. She's failing to thrive. Now I let Penny and Gigi pick their spots on my side of the bed first. And then I just kind of work around them to sleep. And we have two giant toy bins because I don't think our precious babies should ever have to walk too far to get their favorite play things. And we've invested heavily in dog hoodies because they are adorable. Like having two furry college kids with tails running around your house. And then lately I took my level dogs to a place that not even Lindsey and the kids are comfortable with. It was one night when it was just the dogs and Lindsey and I at home, I'd had quite a bit to drink. And I was holding Penny like a baby. I like to hold my dogs like babies. I don't know if they like it, but I like it. It's hard to read their expressions. I don't know if it's love and adoration or panic and terror. And I was eating a burrito. And I had a really weird thought. I was like, I wonder if I can feed Penny like a mama bird to a baby bird. And that was the reaction that Lindsey had when I said that out loud. She was like, please do not do that. That's so gross. I'll never want to kiss you again. And so I was going to set Penny down. But then I just looked at her precious little face and her little teddy bear eyes looking at me. And I felt like she was trying to communicate with me. Baby bird is hungry mama bird. Baby bird is starving. So I took a big bite of burrito and just kind of half chewed it up and then dangled it up my mouth and let her kind of lick it off my teeth. And I know that's gross, but it was also the most maternal I've ever felt. Lindsey was horrified. And then she told the kids. And they were horrified. So naturally I started to do it in front of them when they were over at the house. Because I wanted to see the reaction in real time. And they hated so much. The only thing they hate more is me talking about it publicly because it's going to get back to their friends. And I don't really want to embarrass them. I've tried to back off on material about the kids last couple years because they're an awkward social age. And I want to, you know, the repercussions of that. But I do want to take the mama bird baby bird thing a little farther. Because Monroe is 14 and she's never dated anyone that were aware of. She's never brought anybody home. But she will eventually. She'll bring somebody home. And I used to think it would be funny to be the stereotypical cleaning the shotgun debt. Kliche, you know, it's pretty played out. And also way funny or to be the baby bird debt. Oh my God. What a great moment that be just some awkward teen, all tense and, you know, nervous to meet Monroe's father and trying to be on their best behavior. And then they come through the door and I'm just waiting for them 10 feet behind the door. Just baby birding penny just. Are you willing to love my daughter? I love my baby bird. She'll be furious for months, but I'll be laughing about that on my deathbed still. I want my defining moments. Right enough to talk about animals. I have some more groundbreaking, very important political thoughts to share. When you're out in a area with a lot of other people like at a big outdoor concert or at the fairgrounds and you're looking around at the rest of humanity, are you comforted or horrified by understanding that they also get to vote? Like do you look around and think like, yeah, this is great. We're in good hands. Or do you look around and think, how is the ship not already sunk? I just think it's crazy that you don't have to know anything about politics or politicians to be able to vote. Like nothing. You should have to pass some kind of test. I think a fair test would be you have to match a photo of the politician you're voting for to their name. That's it. Just photo to name. Like you don't even know what they look like. There's no fucking way you understand anything about them. And I bet a lot of people will get that wrong. Right? You'd be like, no, that's not Biden. That's an autopsy photo of a 117 year old man. That photo was taken six weeks after he died. No, that is not Trump. That is Emperor Palpatine. That's a dark wizard. That is not Hillary Clinton, but you're very close. A lot of people get that wrong. That's a mug shot of actor Gary Busey. I know that's a silly joke. I wrote that in about 30 seconds late one night when I was just looking at pictures of Gary Busey and I was like, holy shit. Uncanny. But I just I do worry about certain people's decision making abilities. Says the guy who wants to baby bird his dogs. Some people decision they're like they're so objectively bad and just over and over. I'm like, I don't know that they should be voting. Like I'll give an example of who I'm talking about. There's a social media influencer Stephanie Motto. You may not recognize her name, but you probably will remember what she became infamous for. She made over $100,000 one year selling jars of her farts. Right? She far into a jar, seal it off and get a guy to pay up to $2,000 to buy that jar of farts. And business was so good there was so much demand she ended up in the ER. Thought she was having a heart attack. Nope, just a lot of gas in her chest, which is what happens when you turn your body into a fart factory. And the doctor tried to get her to retire, which she wouldn't, which she got smarter in the fart game. Started to fart less, but actually sell more fart jars in a way. Now what she would do is she would fart into a jar, seal it off, take a picture of this jar and then sell a limited number of digital photos as NFTs. And now she got guys to pay up to $200 a pop for a picture of a jar they hope has a fart in it. And you know these are jerk off photos. That's what those guys are doing. They're beating off these photos. And they say you're not supposed to kink shame, but what the fuck is wrong with these guys? Who broke them? What series of bad decisions led to you only been able to come to a picture of a jar you hope has a fart in it? I just picture the saddest demographic for these fart jar. Just some dude, he was able to buy it with the birthday card money he got from his grandma. And he's sitting in the room that was supposed to be his mom's cross stitch studio, but he refuses to move out. And the door is locked and he's in a dark room. The only light is the computer monitor. Just a picture of an empty jar. And he's sitting in his gaming chair and he's got his sweatpants pushed down to his ankles. And his Pokemon shirt rolled up to his armpits. And he's got his bruised and battered cock in one hand. A dick that's never known a woman's gentle touch, only the cold callous grip of an angry in cell. And his other hand, he has his phone, he's DMing Stephanie Mato. He's like, you promised there's a fart in the jar, right? I don't want to come to an empty jar like an idiot. I just think maybe that guy shouldn't be a little vote. Stephanie Mato should be president. She's a genius. If you can sell jars of maybe farts, sky is the limit for your entrepreneurial activity. I don't know, maybe instead of having some people not be able to vote, maybe just people's voting power should differ from one another. Maybe when you turn 18, you get one vote. But then you can get more votes if you make better decisions going forward. AI bots are something just monitored your life choices. And you can go down to no votes if you make terrible decisions. Maybe you learn CPR because you're a good person. You just want to help others. Yeah. And then one day you're out at the park and you see someone in this pond in the middle of the park, they're drowning. And you risk your life to save the life of this stranger. Why are they even swimming in this pond in the first place? But you run out there and you swim out there and you bring them back to short and you breathe life into their lungs. That's beautiful. You get 15, 20 extra votes. But what if like a month later, same park, you get caught beating off in the bushes when now you have no votes. You're all over the place. You're too inconsistent. We have no idea what you're going to do in the booth. I can't trust you. Also, we should change the criteria for who gets to run for higher office because there's almost no criteria right now. It's crazy. Like to become president, you just have to be at least 35 naturalized citizens, resident for at least 14 years. You could also be a felon. You could have a variety of felonies. You couldn't vote for yourself, but you could run. Yeah, that's true. You could be a level three sex offender and technically become president. You could be the first president not allowed to live in the White House because it's too close to a school. That's technically possible. You can actually murder somebody and become a senator. Again, couldn't vote for yourself, but could run. In one random scenario I thought of, I think murdering someone is the best way for you to become a senator. Check out this long con. I've thought up. You don't have to be 30 to run for the senate. That's pretty young. Let's say you're running for senate, you're 30 years old, you get close. You get down to the last two or three, but you know you're not going to win. If you really, really want to be senator someday, here's what you do. You publicly execute your main rival. Right? You're going to get in a lot of trouble. You're going to go to prison. But if you have a good lawyer, no priors, and behave yourself while you're in prison, there's no way you're getting more than 30 years. Now you're 60 years old. Pretty young for a politician. You get out and you run again. And this time you will win. Who in the right mind is going to run against you? You'd have some wild ass campaign slogans too. Vote for Cummins, because no one has to die. Not again. Also crazy that there's no educational or prior work experience requirements for the highest political offices. Like running the biggest economy in the world could be your first job. You don't have to know how to read, count to five, nothing. There's no equivalent for that in the corporate world because it's really fucking stupid. The corporate equivalent would be if a company every four years, they gathered every employee in the warehouse, and took a vote to decide who's going to lead the company the next four years. Does it matter what your position is? Anybody can be president. Companies would fold left and right. Good job guys, you did it. I'd like to welcome the new president and CEO of Advanced Biotech Nanotechnology. You may recognize him from the cafeteria where he's worked part-time for the last three weeks. Bob Anderson, better known as Hot Dog. Hot Dog Anderson, start sending out those resumes. Thank you. That's what I was hoping for for Hot Dog Anderson. The crowd in general never likes Hot Dog Anderson as much as I do. You get it. Well, I hope none of the material I told tonight upset you too much, especially the political stuff. And if it did, I hope you can just kind of grow up and get the fuck over it and stop being such a crybaby. Thank you so much for that right now. We have too many people that just want to wallow in their own echo chamber and just refuse to hear any other dissenting points of view. And that is not a healthy way to have a society. There's always going to be a lot of different opinions. The best way to have a healthy society is to have compromise and discourse. But we don't do that right now as a society, right? We just scream at each other. We're in a relationship of sorts. And so we should communicate and talk things out and work on it. Like no relationship counselor worth half a shit, seen a couple having trouble, would advise them to do what we do as a society right now. No one would be like, hey, all right guys, stand on other sides of the room and fucking scream at each other. Plug your ears. Don't listen to the person. Never back down. Never apologize. That's what we do. It's crazy. I wish we had more people like my grandpa Ward. He was great hearing other people's opinions. Right, he lived in this tiny little town in Idaho, Riggins, for his entire adult life. And he would have this weekly breakfast with these other guys where they would discuss politics, religion, everything for the last few decades of his life. He was a Democrat, not religious. They were Republican. They were religious. They disagreed on so much. They argued. Things got heated. But at the end of the breakfast, they would still respect each other, shake hands, and agree to meet the next week. And when he was on his deathbed, yeah. And when he was on his deathbed, the last couple of weeks of his life, and he was too sick to go to the diner, those same guys were the ones who came to him and kept those talks going. Right? And finally, after all those years, when he was near death and no longer worried about consequences, he fucking killed him. He had enough of their shit. And he left the world a better place than he found it. No, no. Now, he kept those talks going right into the end. It was beautiful. And those were the guys who cried the hardest at his funeral. It was a beautiful thing. And I think if we could do that as a society, keep talking, not give up on each other, be to Nacius, you know, persevere, keep pushing forward when times get tough. Life could be better than has truly ever been. But we got to work hard to get there and not give up. And that's hard sometimes. And sometimes when I feel like giving up, there's a hero I met about a decade ago that I like to think about who inspires me, to keep going no matter what. And I want to share this person's story with you, maybe they'll inspire you. He was in Santa Monica, California, and Lindsay and the kids and I, we used to go to this 50s diner, this great little nostalgic diner. We get about a block from this place, and we hear the unmistakable sound of a car wreck. We look at the other end of the block. It was this old cutlass, taking a right hand turn off Santa Monica Boulevard, and it starts mashing the first part car it tries to pass. Very slowly, it's just grazing along the side of this car, ripping off the paint, so that popping off the mirror, it could stop, it could tap the brakes and stop at any moment, and just doesn't. So slow, it just mangles this car, and then it proceeds to the exact same thing to the second car it tries to pass. Like we're mesmerized. And as it gets closer, you can see that this is not the first two accidents this car's been in today. Legitimately, it looks like it was driven there from the demolition derby where it took a beating. And it proceeds to hit to some degree, even if it's just a glancing blow, every single parked car on that entire side of the full block. It just kept veering to the right, because its front right tire wasn't just blown, it was completely gone. Just a bent rim, so it's tilted, so it'll try to correct, and then inevitably slam back to the right. And we're wondering, who is driving this? When they come into view, it was an older lady, probably in her 80s, but not who I expected. She seemed very well put together, not disheveled, not disoriented, nothing. Like she was her posture was perfect, she had a great haircut, nice silky shirt, just smile on her face, she had her hands at 10 and 2, she had driving gloves on, which I felt work excessive. Just considering her visible skill set, she had a real happy energy, seemed really positive and upbeat. Her energy could not match up less with the carnage she's leaving in her way. And when she gets to the end of the block where we're standing, I try to stop her, because this is dangerous. I was like, man, stop, stop, stop. She sees me at first and she tries to wave me off. Just takes her hand off the wheel for a second, like, I can out of here, mom has got shit to do. So, I try to get like, man, please stop, stop. She now she stops. She stops, she puts the car in park, I tell her, I'm like, your tire's gone. She turns off her engine, she takes her seatbelt off, safety first. She comes out of the car, walks around, I revealed to her the roughly a million dollars in insurance claims. She's just launched single handedly. And I explained her, this is very dangerous, she's going to hurt herself or someone else, so I got to call this in. And she should call someone to come pick her up. And all she says to me is, okay, still seems very happy. So now she goes, do I assume get her phone? She goes, she gets in the car, shuts the door, locks it, puts her seatbelt back on. Turns over the ignition, puts the car in drive, I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? Starts to creep forward and I try to stop her one last time. I was like, man, please stop, stop. She gives me the most reassuring, calm down buddy, everything's going to be A-OK thumbs up. Just to quick thumbs up. Drives through the intersection, and the next block hits two more cars, press over a little hill, not of our lives forever. That's all I know about her, never sorry again. But I think about her a lot. We've talked about her in the family ever since. We call her the Perseverance Fairy. She refused to be stopped that day. No matter what obstacles life threw at her, I mean they were parked, but you get it. She was going to keep going, and we like to pretend that she is still going somewhere right now. She's still driving. And she'll never stop because she's not a real human. She's a mythological entity sent to inspire us, to remind us to keep pushing forward when we feel like we can't. She shows up at your lowest points, how great would that be? To lose your job, you're down to your last 20 bucks, you want to quit, you're just like, ah fuck it, I give up. But then you hear, mashing metal from down the streets. There she is, still living along. She's like, you know I go, we don't quit brother. Thank you Perseverance Fairy, and thank you for the apples, you guys are great, hey, Lina. Thank you guys so much. I'm going to speed my mind, I'm going, girl you just got up there. Yeah, that was my line, I'm on it. Girl you just ain't no good. And my head now, we been just, out for the laundry, baby. And the time I've got to go with, give it that a look, I'm still your friend. And I must take sure the trail, in the cloud to your day.

What's up, man? You got a little dog with you? I'm not gonna bring a little dog to his show. What are you gonna laugh at? What are you gonna laugh at? I got a dog with you. What's up? All right, take the spotlight off from spotlight, man. Shit, you embarrassing him. Good, look at the brothers over here. What's up, man? We got gold shitting him up, huh? How much is it called? A lot of motherfucking money. You're not gonna knock your goddamn T-valfas on gold tea, huh? What's that you got? You got like a baby jury, girl. That's real nice. That's this real hip. That's your real hip? I'm fucking amazed. Women like motherfucking good hair. I don't know what that shit is, man. My sister is married to a motherfucking convict. But married him because he had good hair. I told her, what the fuck are you doing? You know what I'm saying? That motherfucking love, man. I said, what the fuck are you doing? Okay, I'm gonna tell you a joke. That motherfucking guy's so good. That's hair. Blood heads on it. We see black people though, right? We're good hair. We always make some goddamn excuse on it. You know what I'm saying? I'm just kidding. Damn, baby, you got some... That's your hair? She said, yeah, that's all I mean. So, damn, that's real, buddy. That's a nice hair. Well, you know, we got Andy and then off our hammer. All right. Oh, no, my mother's hot on her side. The fuck out of here. Yo. You're cute. Very pretty woman. I hate a pretty motherfucking woman. Because they're hard to leave, man. You know what I'm saying? You can't walk out on the motherfuckers, right? You know, you're just like, what? What the fuck is it? And if you can't understand me, fuck it. Please. What are you doing this to me? That shit is hot.

 Comedy Central presents... ...Nate Bargette. APPLAUSE Yes, you know. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Wow, everybody. Crazy. I'm proud of every one of you. All right, every one of you I'm proud of. Different. It is great to be here. Very fun to be in New York. I live here, so that's why it's fun. I am from Tennessee, though, originally. And I stubble a little bit of an accent. And they always come up and they're always like, Oh, what's up? Where's your accent from? I'm like, Tennessee. But I like it's cool. I have a cousin that lives in Florida. All right. I don't even... Are we just naming states? Is that what's going on? I don't know what. When I moved to New York, though, it's funny. It's like New York accent. It's a big melting pot. Because it's like all the different cultures. It's not a melting pot at all. It's actually a bunch of pots that one of the next their own kinds of pots. And not talk to other pots. Yeah. It's good stuff. It's good. My landlord is a Chinese pot. And... Which is fun. She only hires like old Chinese dudes to fix her stuff. So, like when they come over, like they don't speak English. And like, I'm not going to learn another language. I have barely knocked this one out. So... So when you fix this stuff, you got to just hope he does the right thing, you know, because you can't tell him not. Maybe he comes over and starts fixing the couch. You're like, all right. I guess that's what he's fixing today. I don't know why we would ask him to do that. But... One day he came over and our gas heat broke. So he comes over to fix it. And I'm staying outside. And I see him like... He's like downstairs. And you see like a fireball just explode like Adam. So, like he like... He runs outside. And you get like we're both standing there. And you could just see that we both wish we could talk to each other at that point. Or just like... That's all I got. I got nothing. I missed this. I missed going down there. I like him. I missed it like... I mean, I'm gonna go Walmart very easily. Well, Walmart guy. I like him. A lot of people don't like Walmart. They say it's big business. Like it kills the mom and pop shops. But really Walmart, they wear a mom and pop shop. At some point, and then they got their act together. And became unbelievable. So... Yeah, I just stuck with him. And then he got there. And he was like, Yeah, I just stuck with him. They're always open. Mama, pop shops close for no reason. You go in there like, why are you closing today? Like we're sad. You're like, all right, that's not even... That's not even a legit, legit thing. Walmart, you could shoot the entire staff. It would be an hour of confusion. And they'd be up and running again. That's how great Walmart is. It's unbelievable. The best. Went to school on Tennessee. Which is fun. I went to a community college for an entire year. And I do not have one credit. It didn't make... None of it counted. The reason is because I had to take remedial classes. So... Which remedial basically means you're like, look, we have no idea how you're high school that you leave. And we are shocked and we're actually going to look into it. But... But until the end, here's your class as you're going to take. Here's what I took. I took math. Like, I don't like the book said math. Like, that's what... How crazy is that? They stopped calling it math after like, six grade. I... I had to take reading. I took reading. I drove to that class. I drove to a reading class. I'm not even an immigrant. I am from here. I should have knocked that out years ago. And with reading, I think they were just impressed when you made it to the class. They were like, look, who made it today, buddy? You're like, fun, you guys. You guys are good. The best. And always, like, it shut down my dream because I wanted to play college basketball. And... That... I didn't work out. I didn't work out because I got cut every year for my high school basketball team. So, I had to play for my church because... Yeah. The church cannot cut you. They have to let you play, which is nice. That's a good, you know. I guess they could cut you. You'd be pretty bad if they'd look. We think you're good, but Jesus does not think that they're good. Yeah. He is our captain. And church ball was a lot different, too, because we played, it was a half-court, no three-point line. We played on carpet. That's your first sign. It's not going to count. And they didn't give us a basketball. We didn't have a ball. Like, we would just stand out there and play on honesty. So, you'd be like, I just made it. It was like, oh, that's a good shot. You're really good. I stole it. I forgive you for stealing it. You're a moral point. You can count later. You have to be careful. I just read about, there's this new device you can buy for your car. And it's got, it's like a key this device. And as you press it, it's got a heartbeat detector on it. So, you aim it at your car, you press it. If it flashes, that means like someone is in your car. And they're going to kill you. All right. It's not going to be good. So, you press it. If you want to buy it, it's like $550. If you do not have that money, you can do the old school route, which is just looking the window. It's either way, really. It's up to you. I told one guy that he tried to tell me that was for like, when people leave their babies in the car. Like, you know, like when you go out and you're like, I cannot remember if I brought my baby today. And I don't want to walk all the way back and check. Like, what if it's not there? If it's not there, I'm going to look like a jackass in front of my friends. I wish I could check secretly without everybody knowing. Here's my method for if someone's going to hide in my car and they're going to kill me. It's a huge fear of mine. So, what I do is, right when I start my car, I have journey, don't stop believing in my CD player. So, right when I start it, it's right on the don't stop believing part. Because that's a great song. Like, you couldn't commit a murder to that song. That is that good of a song. That guy would want to. And then he would like, just be fear, he would just get up and like, look, that's a really good tune. All right, you got me. And then you would climb up front and you become friends. And that's just a neat story. They were like, how do you know Dennis? He was a murderer. Turns out, pretty big journey fan. Actually, a good guy, once you get to know him. He's good. He's good. He's a good guy. Thank you. I've got to travel a lot, which is fun. I get to go, like, I get to go to like different countries. And I don't deserve to get, like, I don't know where these countries are at. I just go, I didn't learn about any of them. Like, I learned about Tennessee. I learned about the states that touched us in case they attacked. And yeah, and I was told the rest was Europe. And that's where all the gays lived. So I didn't have a passport, you know? How's it going? I got to go to Bahrain, which was fun. I, someone's from Bahrain. Are you really? That's crazy. I had no idea it was a country. I'll be honest with you. Three years ago, I'd called you to lawyer, because you're from Bahrain. I literally thought it was the guy we were meeting. Like, that's what I just assumed. I just walked around Bahrain's airport, like, hey, do you know this guy? Bahrain, he's supposed to meet us here. Is he somewhere near here? When we went to Bahrain, we were doing, we did call me for the troops. I don't have like a huge following in Bahrain. But I could start, though, with the one guy right here. So it's one end of time. So we go over there, and when you do come into the, you stay on an army base. But in Bahrain, you can actually leave the base and go to like the downtown Bahrain. So they tell you, when you go out there, they're like, look, it's safe. Just don't draw attention to yourself. So they're like, don't wear American t-shirts and stuff. And you're like, all right, let's find no American t-shirts. So what are you going to do about the white on my skin? Yeah. That's probably going to be the issue. If I, I don't want to come up, excuse me, are you Muslim? Southern Muslim, actually. Is that, my dad was a deacon. That, you know, I really want to go visit Cambodia. That's where it's at, guys. Like, I don't know where it's at, but I know that's where it's at. So that's the good part, you know. Here's what they have in Cambodia. This is a, for real legit tourist attraction that they have. You can shoot a rocket launcher at a cow. Yeah, that's one of their options. All right. And I know you're like, I bet it's pricey. So no, it's not, actually. It's very reasonably priced, which is nice. It's only four hundred bucks. That's not that bad of a deal to shoot a rocket launcher at a cow. And if you're like, well, what if we don't hit it? You know, is it really worth it to take the family there? Yes, it is. All right. No one hits it. Everyone shoots it. They're like, I do this a lot at home. Like, this is kind of... And they're good dudes. They give you 200 bucks back if you don't hit it. So that's a good business. Well, would you not support a business like that? My favorite thing was how they had to come up with that price, four hundred bucks. What on earth do you gauge that off of? Like, someone's like, 500. It's not get greedy with it. I feel... I've been doing some studies and you can fist fight a goat for a hundred bucks down the street. He's not even into it. We're using equipment, so... That would be an unbelievable way to hunt a rocket launcher. They just shoot at the woods and kill... That's like a buffet. You kill like a lot of stuff. That's nice. That would be fun. Animals have it the worst. They died terrible deaths. I heard a story. This kid. He had two goldfish. So he grabbed one of them. He squeezed it and exploded. Yeah. It's pretty crazy. I don't feel bad for that goldfish. Like, you know, he died quickly. I feel bad for the other goldfish that just has to deal with that trauma now. You know what I'm saying that would be? They're not gonna buy this kid another fish. He's killing them. Imagine if you were locked in a room with someone and they just exploded. It would change your life forever. You're like, can I get something else to talk to? They're like, no. You're like, what? I should go deal with this in my own head. I'm not the worst life ever. I still like to eat animals too though. Like, I don't, that story doesn't have any naughty animals. I like chicken a lot. I'm a big fan of chicken. It's weird now because I went to the store the other day to buy some home. And when I was there, they have now they have like two kinds of chicken that you can buy. So they have a free range chicken is one. And then they have, I guess, like a not free range. Like I think his parents were divorced or something. I don't know. So they want you to eat the free range chicken, which is a chicken that is allowed to roam free. Obviously not now, like he is dead at the store. But they still have a list of his hobbies on the package, which I thought, that's pretty nice of him, you know? But I don't eat that chicken. I feel bad. I don't need a chicken that had a dream. And that was that chicken. Life was great for that guy. I just want a miserable not free range chicken. I want to eat a chicken that when they killed it, he was like, look, I'm ready for this. All right. This is brutal. This is the worst. Oh, when I was at the grocery store, I got caught like in this weird thing with his dude. So I was standing in line and I was behind this guy. This white guy. And he pulled out the white race card. Now, I don't know if you'll knew we had a card. But he like had one. So I'm standing behind him. I'm standing behind him. And I just hear him like argue. Like, hear him just go like, what is it? Because I'm white. Is that why you're doing this? Because I'm white. And he looked at me like I'm his brother. Like, hey, are you going to get involved? You're going to come on. I was like, standing there. I was like, no, I'm not getting involved in this. I'm not ready for something like this. I think you're the first guy ever to try this, to be honest with you. I'm not prepared at all. If you wanted me to help you, you should have pulled me aside earlier. You should have grabbed me like, look, I'm going to make history today. Do you want me a part of this or not? It's your call. So I'm married. We have a lot of married people here tonight. A few. Some. That's fun. That's fun. I don't know. I've been married four years now. And it is getting pretty serious today, the truth. A lot. A lot more serious than I thought. I always have, like I have other buddies that are getting married now. So they always like, when they come talk to me. So, like I always tell them they're like, what's it like? Here's what it is. I'm just to everybody. Marriage is like, you ever go to a concert and you see a mosh pit. And you're like, you know what? I'm going to go get that mosh pit. But then once you get in it, you're like, I do not want to be in this mosh pit. At all. I am going to leave and go get some beer. Then the mosh pit is like, didn't you drink last night? All right, mosh pit. Once you get off my back. And let me live my life. Why? My wife's good. She's put up a ton with me. I remember three months into our marriage. One night I came home and I was like really drunk. I was hammered. And I know she loves that. So I spull her a little bit. I'm like a pretty decent guy. So we got a bed. And I'll be honest with you. I peed the bed. Yeah. Shouldn't have. I was pretty good though. I kind of like blamed it on her. Like I remember, I just woke up and I go, hey, what's wet? All right. Did you pour a perfect circle of water underneath me? A flawless circle. She was like, no, you peed the bed. What is wrong with you? Did I marry you or did I have you? I have no idea. I have this point. You know what it is. Here's what it is. Guys, which is not good. Guys are not good at marriage. All right. It's not our fault. We weren't prepared for it. Like women are. Your whole life is built. It's just preparation for marriage. Look at all every toy you played with. When you're a baby, they give you a baby doll. So they give you a baby when you're a baby. You don't even know your life yet. And they're like, look, I would probably start figuring this out. Like this is where it's going. Didn't they give you Barbie and Ken? They live in a little house together. And that is where you learn how to make drama you get. You get the best. You're the best. Then you would play house. Like you would fake vacuum. Just fake vacuum with your friends. That was awesome. And it's weird because when I see my wife vacuum now, like she is living her childhood dream. She's made it. As a guy, we don't have any of that. What do we play for it? You got to keep everybody out of where you are. Especially girls. The only toys we had were transformers and ninja turtles. Those are not even real things. None of them had wives. They weren't married. I never played with my ninja turtles. And I had them go into fight shredder. And then Michael Angelo was like, hey, can you give me two seconds? My wife just showed up. And she looks furious about something. What do you want from me? And she's like, what are you all doing? What's that April skank doing here? You're like, listen. She's a reporter. I got in trouble with my wife because on her last birthday, I got her an oven. Pretty nice oven. Take it easy. The reason I bought an oven, because I know, like the vacuum, her other favorite toy as a kid, was the Easy Bake oven. So to go with her big girl vacuum, I got her. I. So to go with her big girl vacuum, I got her a grown up adult oven. Like there was heart behind it. Like that's not impressive. If she came home and bought me a truck, and it turned into a live robot, I would lose my mind. Freak out. Thank you guys so much for coming out. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Yeah.

 All right, yeah, y'all ready for the comedy? All right, let's give it up to Doodies, come out of Chicago Illinois. Please welcome Corey Holcomb. All right, what's up? I'm going to hop right into it.

You ever seen if it waxed be running all out there, you? Man, he had... Man, this is ill. I ain't... Look, he has so much wax in his ill.

Stank. So it seemed like there was burning a chitlin' instant up in that motherfuckers. It was a nasty... It was a nasty... Dude, and they got... Y'all never go out there and house them. People with them old nasty apartments and they usually got one of them old bathrooms. You know, you go up in there and the tub still be on full legs. You know, you can sweep under that motherfucker. And they got the old sink in there with the double faucet. You know, with a hot water, come out this side. And the cold water, come out this side. Keep from burning your hand. You got to switch your sh... I'ma tell the lady something. Ladies, I want to put y'all up on something about men. Did y'all know every man in here could easily go three months without having sex? Now, let me tell you something y'all don't know. Every man got a woman on the side. I'm tell you, I don't care who he is. Every man got a woman on the side. But don't get mad, because I ain't talking about like another female. I'm talking about that person. You know, fellas, the one you messing around with all the time. Huh? I ain't going front. This is my main squeeze. You know what I'm saying? Whenever my woman be, oh, all right, you don't want to get me done. Fuck you then. Put your coat on, baby. You going to the holiday inn in this month? I like to... I like to ball up and draw that little face on her. And talk a little shit to her before I get with her. No. No. No. Yeah. I don't want this dick don't shit. He's so hearty. All right, girl, go to work. Woo! Hey, let me hit this here from the back. Ha! Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Now, I'm a rabid up, dumb man. I want to talk about some man. Man, I went to this church, right? Man, it was this preacher. His name was Reverend Sleeparown. He was cold, oh, fellas. If you'd been in this church, you'd have been jumping up and down in the out. Because he talked about something to hit home with a lot of brothers. So, you know, he came up, you know, I didn't back this preacher's come out. He was like, wow. I want to talk to y'all this morning about a problem in my life. It's a problem that dwells with a lot of men. Backstabs, you're like a knight. Goes deep into your pocketbooks. Put your financial bind. It's a problem that ain't never going nowhere. It's with you for a lifetime. I'm not talking about drugs and alcohol. Compared, that's a light drama. See a man's biggest burden is his baby's mama. Well, I'm calling over for Chicago.

 Our next guest is a fantastic comedian. You may know her from her wonderful podcast, Self Help List. Please welcome, Kelsey Cook. Whoo! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Whoo! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Hi, guys. I'm so happy to be here. Something cool just happened to me. I actually just got married. Yes! Yes! Oh, my God. Thank you. My husband's also a comedian, so our wedding budget was $42. So nice. It's great to finally find that person, though, because dating's exhausting, right? Guys are like hairstyles in your 20s. You try a bunch of different ones. And by your 30s, you're like, oh, this is the one I'll be buried with. Just get some soccer mom bangs and call it a day. I'm tired. My husband's been sober for two years, which is great. Oh, great. Thanks. It's awesome. But if you take the AA quiz, it makes everybody sound like they have a drinking problem. The first question is, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood? Is there any other reason to drink alcohol? Like, no, I'm in it for the acne and diarrhea. The second question is, after consuming alcohol, have you ever done something you've regretted? Do you mean literally every time? Have I had alcohol? Who's getting drunk and doing the Lord's work? I've never had five margaritas. I've been like, all right, time to donate blood. I've got to pass this party to someone in need. My biggest regrets stem from alcohol. I used to take shots of gin and chase them with a deli meat. Yeah. You know your white trash when your cocktails involve ham. But if you're broke, you form weird habits like that. Like, if you don't have a dishwasher, are you trying cookies in as few dishes as possible? I don't know if you guys do this. Like, if you want banana on your cereal, but you don't want to get a knife dirty, do you ever just tear pieces off with your teeth and then... LAUGHTER Ah, some of you did that today. I didn't even know that was weird until my husband caught me doing it. And was like, are you mama-burning yourself? LAUGHTER We're poor and not amish. Please stop. Get some help. I keep trying to get him to go do a couple's massage with me, and he refuses. And I think it's gonna be great guys to get a little weird about massages, because if you get a female masseuse, you're worried you'll get turned on. And if you get a male masseuse, you're really worried you'll get turned on. LAUGHTER Like, well, came here to relax. Now I got questions for myself. LAUGHTER Shoot. LAUGHTER I've learned I get turned on every massage regardless of who is doing it. I'm so creepy. Like, I love when you go and they massage your hand. I always just want to slowly close my fingers. LAUGHTER LAUGHTER I'm just whisper, I need this one. LAUGHTER I'm really ruined the hour for both of us. We really want to see the play Hamilton, but tickets are too expensive. But I found out that people have been uploading the play onto Pornhub. Yeah, I swear it was in the news. People are sneaking it online that way. They're calling it Hamilton. LAUGHTER Beautiful. I just hope that some meathead guy out there, like, cracked open his laptop, feeling horny, clicked on that link, and then 20 minutes in was just like... LAUGHTER LAUGHTER I thought a character development. LAUGHTER Where are all the boobies? LAUGHTER My friend Brad actually told me that my celebrity lookalike is this porn star named Jesse Rogers. So I googled her, and the first picture that popped up was her doing hardcore anal. LAUGHTER And I got a little creeped out, realizing that my friend Brad saw that and thought... LAUGHTER You know who this reminds me of. LAUGHTER Old gaping butthole, Kelserue. LAUGHTER Yeah, old back door cook, look at her go. LAUGHTER A plus. That's the hell, Brad. I am starting to worry a little bit about the passion in my relationship, because my husband just called me Bud. Yeah. It's not a good sign. My stomach hurt, and I groaned, and he was like, Hey, how are you feeling, Bud? LAUGHTER Uh, worse. Now that I became your son... LAUGHTER It really bothered me like I could not stop thinking about it, so, uh, the next time that we had sex. LAUGHTER Right, as he was about to finish, I whispered in his ear, Make it a good one, chief. LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Yeah, I have never seen a man hate an orgasm before. LAUGHTER All right, I'm Kelsieka. You guys have been so good. CHEERING

 this before. It is drunk. This goodbye gives me tears not by feeling like I was reading K 보�ophy's lies. This is such a big night for you. But I'm celebrating. I finally just slept with my high school crush. Right? Thank you. But I swear now he like expects me to go to his graduation. Like, I know where I'm going to be in three years, right? I'm like, whoa. So it's down. Fucking kids, right? Fucking. You look like upset. Like, I don't fuck kids. That's a joke. Like, I would never. I shouldn't say never. That's like, you don't know. I feel like I just painted myself in a corner there. But it's not a good way to start. This is a beautiful theater. I should have started off with something other than kid fucking. You guys are right. Start over. Class it up. My mom's a cunt. Hear me out. I know, like, not everyone's comfortable with that word. Half of you are like, oh, right. No, don't say that. And the other half of you are like, oh, my God, what a coincidence. I brought her to a soccer game because I wanted to show her what boundaries look like, you know? I was like, look. She's like, I don't see him. I'm like, I know. I know. Stop calling my friends. How about that? She's always bragging about the dumbest stuff. The other day she was telling me, she's like, you know, I can still fit in my wedding dress. I was like, oh, my God. Who cares, right? I mean, it is weird that she's the same size now as she was when she was eight months pregnant, but I just... I don't think bragging is cool. A little about me. I took Plan B about 10 days ago. Thank you. Oh, my God, you guys. It's the only clap if you mean it. I did. You know what it is? There's some people here. It's the morning after pill. I take it the night before because I'm smart. But some people like to... I'm with you good people. I believe birth begins at conception. So I just like, beat that shit. Plan B is all. Who's taking it? Who's taking it? Thank you. Oh, sorry. Room of heroes. Everyone's like... Oh, I did. I took it. It's over. I went to my normal pharmacy. I walk in. Pharmacist is like, hey, I'm like, please don't call me a nickname. He's like, what do you want, Ambien? I'm like, no, I'm not addicted to that. You guys know that. I only take that when I'm drinking. They're like, what do you want? I was like, Plan B. And they were like, they didn't even hide it. They're like, ew, you whore. I was like... Yeah, you can't say that. They're like, you're going to feel nauseous. I was like, oh, I took it. I felt fine. I went to yoga. I'm like, can these people tell I'm like mid-abortion right now? This is... This is not good. It was easy. They should call it Plan A. That's how I used to. That's a great plan. Let's start with this one. I don't think that's like adorable that I just took Plan B. I'm 31. That's not cute at all. That's cute when you're like, you're like 21. You go, you sit on your mom's bed, you cry, and you're like, oh, the condom broke. I'm like, the what broke? I do. I still think I'm 20. It's so gross. Every bar I go to, I show my ID. They're like, no, that's okay. They're really relaxed here. I hope they don't get rated at this place. I don't know. But the girls I grew up with, they're living normal adult lives. So they call me now and they're like, hey, I'm pregnant. And I still react like, what are you going to do? I'm like, I'll drive you, I guess. That's my favorite reality show. You know, Shotsin mom. Or if you're from the south, mom. They don't wait, right? This is poor planning on my part. I'm kind of dizzy. I donated blood today. That's what I call getting an AIDS test. I know. People hate that joke. They have AIDS. So if you didn't laugh, get tested. Check it out. I went through a breakup this year, this guy. I walked in on him masturbating. Yeah, he's like, are you mad? I'm like, no, but you seem to be holy shit. I'm like, does it owe you money? Why are you... He's in this guy. We were so different. I knew he was like really into family, you know, and I mentioned my mom. He'd never come on the road with me on the weekends, because he wanted to spend time with his wife. And I just... I'm better. No, the truth is I thought he was going to bring up with me the whole time for the lamest reason, because I wouldn't swallow. But I have a not allergy. Like, what did he expect? Stop telling us it's good for our skin. Fuck you guys. What girl is like, oh, okay. Guys are so gross, right? Guys are gross. You're gross, okay? They're so gross. I had sex with a guy recently, more semen than you've ever seen in your life. I was like, did you just get out of jail? What's... What is the meaning of this? It's a compliment. No. But that's what guys want, because they're so gross. If it were up to them, we'd all look like Carrie and the prom scene at the end. Just... No girl wants that. We don't want that. We're lazier than you. If it were up to me, the cleanup would be me taking a Q-tip, going, boop, a sleep. That's it. Instead, I was like, I've been slimed. Well, I like to watch porn. Like, what girls in here like porn? Thank you. I love it. All the whores are in the front. This is the best. I don't like to watch the end of porn. I don't like to watch the end of any porn, because guess what happens at the end of the rainbow every time? Spoiler alert. He comes at her face. Oh! What an amazing choose your own adventure. That always ends exactly the same. There's never a twist, right? He's never like the guys having sex with her. He looks off camera in her backpack. He's like, oh, are you reading that Nicholas Barx book, too? Oh my god. What are the chances? Let's start a bed and breakfast together. No. He just comes on her head. We don't want to see that. I don't want, because we think about that girl, like that poor girl. And we know, as soon as the director yells cut, that she's just stumbling around like Helen Keller looking for a towel. Just wear. Did you guys go to lunch? This isn't cool. You promised this is good for my skin. So the guy I was dating, he was like so lazy. He was one of those dudes. He wouldn't go down on me. I had to become a climber every time. Head up there, just holding onto the headboard, like a nosy neighbor peaking over the fence. I felt like Wilson from Home Improvement. I'm like, hey! Tool man, what? It is embarrassing up there. I wanted to date with a guy recently. He's like really hot, so I was pretending to be a good person. I was saying things like, I love kids, and I'm not racist. It's vague lies. And he's like pretend like you want to use a condom. I like to say something fun when I bring it up. But honest, I'll be like, you're going to want to wear this. I've had a busy month. It's like a petri dish right now. I don't know what's happening. But this guy we went out, and he was like, you can tell when a guy dates a lot. He had like date questions. He was like, if you could have lunch with anybody living or dead, who would it be? I thought about it. I answered honestly. I was like, Mark Twain. I think he was hilarious. And he goes, Amy, it's got to be somebody real. And he's like, oh, you're legit retarded. That's so cute. I'm going to sleep with a retarded person. I did. So I've been on the road a lot lately. And every town I go to, you have to do like local press. And they all ask the same questions every week. They ask me the same exact question. They're just like, what's the hardest part about being a female comedian? What is it? What's the hardest part? I'm like, what would you guess? Well, it's the rape. No, but they ask, they're just like, and I guess it's a normal question. Is it harder for female comics as a harder? And it's not. Like they think we just get up here and just bleed all over the stage. Oh, my ovary is how do I keep him in my body? I think it's totally not harder. It's harder to be a chick in general, for sure. That sucks. That's not fun. Right? Right, girls? No, it is. It sucks. Just in terms of laziness. Like, look at the guys you're here with tonight. Okay. Some of them bangable. Not all of them. Let's be real. Let's keep it honest. Okay. But like, what did you do to get ready? You know, like, how long did it take you to get ready? You didn't get ready is the answer. Men don't... They put on a shirt. They give themselves one of these in the mirror. They're out. That's it. And look at the shirts you guys are wearing. Every one of you that I can see, you could have worn that when you were a toddler on picture day. Everyone. No difference. Check it out. But look at the beautiful girls you're with. Look at it so much work for us. It takes me 90 minutes to look this mediocre. 90 minutes. We are circus freaks women. We are. We put paint on our faces like warriors. We were... I'm wearing stilts. We wear stilts. We wear heels all night. And we put a string in our buttholes. Just... Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. Huh. Am I pretty? Huh. We were jewelry. Shini should look over here. Follow me to the altar. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. I think as a woman as you get older, you get lazier just by looking around. No. I just... I work in Vegas a lot. That doesn't sound awesome. But I do stand up in Vegas a lot. And I see these packs of young girls that still have the energy, you know, just a pack of girls. And I see these packs of young girls wearing tube dresses, right? And just the heels. They can't handle. They have to hold each other and do like Wizard of Oz walk, chain gang kind of... They all look identical. Looks like a horror computer just shot out a prototype and they just started walking. Tonight, tonight's the night, you guys. I like seeing them at the end of the night, you know, like it didn't work out. They're carrying their heels. They're crying their makeup off. It looks like they're melting. Why didn't anyone pick me? You have puke on your tube, Amber. It's all work. It's work having a vagina. That's work. Guys don't think that it's work, but it is. You think it just shows up like that to the event? It doesn't... Every night, it's like getting it ready for its first quince in-year-a. Believe me. It's a lot of work. It didn't used to be work. I know that from watching Vintage porn. It was no work. Zero. I even... I remember my mom bottomless when I was a kid. And it was just... BOOM! It looked like the black smoke monster from Lost was just following her. It's like... It's mom being swarmed by bees, what is? And then something happened. I don't know. Like 10, 15 years ago, all the dudes got together and had like a meeting. Like a fantasy football draft about our privates. They were like, we can't get in there. It's like being a nom, trying to... What do we do? And then they just came to us and they were just like, ladies, would you mind looking like babies again? And we were like, uh... Like, what do you mean? Just clean up the sides a little bit. Or the whole enchilada. And we're like, yeah, that's not super weird. Uh... So now we go. We get it done. We have to go get it done. Uh, yeah. Like that's... We go and get it done, guys. Like it doesn't just happen. I don't care how cool your girl is. She doesn't have like, alopecia of the crotch. It just falls out. And the shape of your initials. That's not what happens. That's not how it goes down. You know, we get it done. We have to go see a woman, usually from a third world country. It's never from like... Like, it's never me that comes and gets you from the waiting room. Like, I'll never be like, hi, I'm Ashley. I'm here to take care of your pussy. Like, no. That's not how it goes. Like, the chick who does it to me in New York, I think she's from like the killing fields of Cambodia. Like this poor woman, I can tell. Like, she has seen some shit, you know? She has been through it and she was like a doctor there. And now she does this and she hates me. And she's even hiding it. I walk in. She's like, ugh, I'm sorry. But she should. She should hate me because I'm like, we're the worst, white and tidal girls. I walk in chewing gum. My phone was like... I'm like, don't get any wax on my new eggs. What? She's like, my parents were murdered in front of me. I'm like, I'm on the phone. But she wins. Like, those chicks win every time. Because what they do, and I always forget this, they go, she goes and gets a mirror. And she shows it to me. She shows me my own vagina. And I have to act like I'm not horrified. And I'm horrified. It's the worst thing in the world. And what she's saying in that moment is, are you happy now? You dumb bitch. You just paid me to assault you. And now you look like a toddler. Is that what? Is that cool? Yeah? It's not cool. It's the worst thing you'll ever see in your life. It's red. It looks angry. It looks like an old man frowning. Just, no. Visit me. It's so much work. I think guys have it easier. I'm not sure. What do you guys think? Yeah? You do. Did you ever see an uncircumcized penis? You did. Did you know? Did you know you were going to see it? No. It's always a fucking surprise party, right? It's a big, it's him, right? It's him. Wait, here's the funniest thing. I'm sorry that everyone knows about your penis now, but here's the best part. He's wearing a shirt that says brown coats. Nobody ever tells you, right? He didn't tell you. They don't tell you shit. They're just like, boom, reunited with Snuffle Opagus. Enjoy. Enjoy. You guys are so cute. Why don't they tell us? Tell me. We have to become award-winning actresses. Like, oh, no, that's totally cool. Mom, can you come pick me up? I don't know. It's wearing like a hat or like a cape. Like a brown coat type thing. Why don't they tell us? I would tell you, if I had an extra flap over my clitoris, I'd give you a heads up. I would. I'd be like, you're going to encounter a wizard. Keep going. Take this compass. I'd make it exciting. I'd play the music from Zelda. Be great. I hooked up with a guy one time that had no testicles. Count them. Zero testicolo. You think he brought that up a dinner? Because he didn't. I got to find out in real time. It was dark in the room. Let me paint the romantic picture here. And I went right to the spot. I know them to always be. No GPS necessary. I picked up the main event. And I felt like a girl learning braille. I just kept. And like, we don't. Girls don't care about your balls. No one care. I would never call my sister the morning after the night. But this guy is balls. No. But when they're not there, you miss them. They're like grandparents. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. Thank you. The way I saw an uncircumcised penis, I met this guy at a bar. He was French. I should have known. But I didn't know he was French. I thought we were just wasted and faking the accent. It makes my vagina shut. I mean, thank God for that other hole. But my butthole. Oh, you knew. So I went home with this French guy because he said something adorable. I have an apartment. So we're making out. He's very sensual. He started to pick me up. He realized he was in over his head. I got planted back down. It's hard to feel sexy when a dude's winded from trying to hoist you. He's like legs are shaking. I tried to land cute like a gymnast. No, but I do. I know I have a body type. I know I'm a base. I get right down. I'm not hoist me up on top. I want to fly. I know my body type. I usually say, hey, no thanks. I'm like, hey. When I do get hit on, this guy came up to me. And he was from Texas or somewhere I'm not going. And he comes over and he's like, hey, I'll lock you. You're sturdy. I'm sorry. He's like, you look like you could take a punch. I'm like, oh. Don't I feel like the bell of the ball. I'm making out with Frenchinator. He gave up right away because he's French, I guess. Oh, my God. Thank you. He pulled his dick out immediately. He must have been thinking, she's the one. And I'm looking at it. I'm just like, what? What is that? Are we having a pillow fight? Why is the gnome from Travelocity in your underpants? But you guys are sensitive too. I couldn't do what I was thinking. I was like, ah, run down the five stories of his walk-up. I had to be a team player and be like, all right, here we go. Just fighting through the skin, trying to find his actual... I felt like I'm agissioned with the scarves. I'm just making sure I'm the best looking one of my friends. It's really easy. I cut certain people out of my life. And I now hand select strangers off of Facebook. And surround myself with real trolls and reptiles. You should see these monsters. I had a friend Nikki, she kept losing weight. I took her out of my phone. Fuck her, I'm sorry. But there's one check I've been friends with forever. Her name's Sabina. She's gorgeous. And of course she is with the name Sabina. What a white annoying name, right? You have to be so hot to pull off names like that. Sabina Priscilla. You can't have a bummy and a lazy eye and be like, I'm Sabina! It's nice try. We're going to call you Birth of Bitch. But that was cute. That was cute. Guys go crazy over her. I never get hit on like that. The only time I get hit on is last call at the bar. Right? That's when I shine. I'm telling you, what a weird time of night, right? The lights go on. Just feels real rabie all of a sudden. Post-apocalyptic. Something happens to the men. They're just like, I need a woman. Like they all just start pacing like gorillas. The eyes widen. It looks like they can only see by heat. They're like what? Predator. I see some dude in a full blackout just walking at me. Like a zombie just pointing at his own dick. Like here. I'm like, I'll get us a cab. I know I make it sound like I'm so slutty up here. But I've only been with four people. That was a weird night. That's my business. It doesn't matter what you do, ladies. Everybody's going to leave you for an Asian woman. And you know that. That's right. I'm saying it in San Francisco. In the hotbed. In the hotbed. I get it. I can't compete with an Asian chick. I can't. They're better. I've been thinking about this. I did the math. I know that's their thing. But I did it. I've been thinking about it. I can't win. How can I compete with an Asian chick? They're smarter. They have naturally silky hair. This Jew denial took me like 40 minutes. They laugh like this because they know men hate when women speak. They're better. They're just better. And how do they bring it on home for the win? Oh, the smallest vagina's in the game. I can't compete with that. What do I have? What am I? I've got a BA in theater and HPV. No one's buying my stock. I am plummeting. I'm going to black, guys. That's what I'm trying to do. That's what I'm doing. Yeah. I can't believe I've never done it. I'm built for it. It seems weird. I haven't. Gotta go for the black guy. Have you ever? Black guy. Yeah. She's like, uh, yeah. She's like, yeah, look at my shirt. Look at my shirt. You know I fag black guys. How cute are you? You're so cute. You're hot. I'm not gay. I've caught a finger, but you get what I'm saying. Black guys are the future. Some chicks are scared. You know what they say. Once you go black, your parents don't talk to you anymore. Something like that. I don't know. Something like that effect. But no, this dude comes up to me. This black guy. And he was into it because it's come on. And he walks over and he's like, I'm Derek. And I was like, Derek. He was like, Derek. And he had on like a nice shirt. And he had like a job. And I was like, no. I want a brother. If I'm going to do it, I want to really do it. You know, not Derek. I want him to like not even have a name. Just like nicknames. Everyone's like, pooky. He's like, what's up? No job. We need like a ton of lube, but just like for his elbows. You know what I'm talking about? Oh, that was insanely racist. You're right. You're right. I love joking about race. It's like my favorite. I was talking about this the other day. I was hanging out literally all my black friend. And... And I remember I was like, to Mende, or whatever. To tap a street. It's something wild. You know. It's something crazy. I mean, that's why they need Google in the delivery room, I think. Right? It's everywhere else. Why not there? Right? So when her mom was like, I'm going to name you to Mimbo. Google would show up and say, did you mean Jennifer? Yeah. To Mende. So I'm hanging out with tapioca and... ...tempoir or something. And what was she saying? She was like, girl, like I won't do some racist impression. So don't worry. But she was like, girl. I mean, we were like mid-double Dutch. And I'm just like, stop yelling. We're not at the movies. Thank you. Thank you. I'm glad you guys laughed at that. That does not always work. I'll be honest with you. I mean, nothing works 100% of the time. Right? Except Mexicans. I've noticed. That's the one. Boo. Right? The Mexicans. I hear you guys are... ...reaching to the choir. So, I'll ask you guys, what do you guys think? Four against every night? Okay. I've dealt with two kinds of guys when it comes to my personal asshole. There's a kind of guy that never acknowledges it. Right? Like the whole time we're together, just never. Which is awesome because who needs the extra maintenance? Can I get a what, what, ladies? Thanks, sister friends. That guy's awesome, right? You know what you're getting with that guy. And then there's the other kind of guy who goes for it immediately. Like you're not even fully kissing yet. He's trying to grab you like a bowling ball. He's just like, no! He's like, you said you like Jeff Dunham. You're like, no! Oh! You can't trust those guys. All right? So I was dating the first kind of guy. No ass play. Like the sex was very vanilla. There was no funny business. No dirty talk. If I sent him a naughty photo, he would just write back, thanks. Like I sent him a fax. He needed. I think I had forwarded him an e-vite. So we were together for like years. And one night out of nowhere, we're at dinner. And he's like, I'd like to talk about something. I'd like to talk about ass play. And I'm like, is that a Broadway show? That show sounds awesome. Let's go see that show. And he's like, no, ass play. And as I'm asking him questions, I realize he hasn't thought it through at all. I was just like, do you mean on you or me? And he was like, oh, I was like, oh Jesus, no! This is not a brainstorm sash here. Your PowerPoint buddy. So that night I was like, I'm going to call him on his bluff. I don't usually joke around in the bedroom, but I was like, fuck this guy. So, like this jv player is going to get it from me. So we're like making out. And I'm just like, where's all the ass play? And like a frightened child. He goes, tonight? And I'm like, uh-huh. And he can't think of what he goes, well, did you shower? Said I'm not going to answer that because I'm not a homeless woman. I'm just some schizophrenic with a cart like, wash me! So we can't think of any other way to stall. So this is what he does. Okay, this is my asshole. This is his finger. He goes like this. And he holds it there. Like he was checking it for a pulse. Like he felt a groundhog might pop out and he'd have to whack him all it. And then I fist him like you look in the brain. He's dead. Oh, God, you guys are awesome. I seriously, sometimes that goes so awkward during a set. I just want to like tap out. I've had this image. Not like a wrestling tap out, but just sort of soft chew out of the room. In an awkward situation, like, why can't we do that? I was working at this club and I walked in the first night and I realized that this club there was a bathroom attendant. Have you ever been like, oh, dope, a bathroom attendant works here? No, you're like, oh, it's awkward. They hate you. You're just like, oh, please. Like, it's unnecessary. Are you ever peeing like, how am I going to leave here without a starburst? I don't like going without somebody listening. No. I go in the bathroom the first night and the bathroom attendant stops me at the door. And she's like, oh, they're all full right now. So you're going to have to wait a minute. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I know how bathrooms work. Like if she hadn't said that, I was just going to go rogue and start pounding on all the stalls up and down with a shiv. No. Peeing in the sink, I do what I want. Bathroom attendant. So unnecessary. So the last night I'm at this club, I go in the bathroom. She's like facing the wall. So I'm like, oh, good. I go right in the stall. And I'm not going to say anything gross. But I'm in there just dropping a ton of heat. Just massacring this bowl. Cheers. I'm texting people like, am I dying? Too loud in my family. I just wrote goodbye. That is about true. I went in the bathroom, peed like a normal person, wife, like a human being. I come out. And I walk over and she's facing the wall. And I'm like, I hear the cheese crying. So I'm like, excuse me. I'm about to wash my hands. So you better get fucking ready. No, she's crying. No, I was like, what's wrong? Is it your choices? No, I asked her what was wrong. And she told me she was like my dog died. So I was like, I'm so sorry. I'm going to go get us some shots. We're going to get weird in here tonight. You and me. And she goes, it just really doesn't feel like six years ago. What do you say? I just looked right at her and just... But I've been really lucky. Like my whole life, I found friends just like me. Like at a young age, I found girls that were just like me. All horse. Just little drunks running around. But in every group of girlfriends, there's always one that's the sluddiest. And it wasn't me and my group of friends, Shocker, was my nickname. But no, in my group of friends... The sluddiest of us was this girl, Katie. And we didn't judge her for that. Like as soon as she would have a boyfriend, she'd start acting like mother Teresa. You know, she'd like walk different. She'd talk differently. Like I remember one time she walked over with her new boyfriend. She was like, Adam and I are thrilled you could join us for brunch. I was like, I've helped you get come out of your hair. Remember, we tried using peanut butter because we're stupid. So she moved to Connecticut and was getting married. And she had a wedding shower there. And I was the only friend from home that could go. So I met all of her new fancy Connecticut friends. And like you know women like this. Like these girls, they were all like very steppered wife. You know, they all wore like pastel, cashmere cardigans and pearls and burberry, like tampons. And they all spoke like this, like almost in a whisper. Like they all were, everybody just walked around whispering to each other. Like oh, I guess we were just born with different vocal cords. Because I was raised better. Do you ski? So I met this party and I'm like, mainlining Shardonnay. Trying to remember fun. Just like why? So one of the girls was like, let's play a game. And I'm like, suicide pack to all go first. This party's the worst. And she goes, no, let's all go around and admit something. And I'm like, oh no. So these girls are going around. The shit their admitting is so boring. I can't, like one girl was like, once I forgot to let the dog out all day. And they were like, no. I'm like, is this happening right now? So the girl who goes right before me, Bridget, the worst human I've ever met. I hope she sees this. That's how bad of a person she is. Like, Bridget, I hope you're watching this. But she wouldn't be up this late. She spoke the softest. You had to lean in and squint and read her lips. Because she just, Bridget talked like an angel was sleeping on her tongue. So anyway, she's like, all right, you guys, it's my turn. Bring it in. And we're like, we're in because we have to be. Because you talk like, faithful. Use your diaphragm bridge. So she's like, I'll admit this. Sometimes after Richard falls asleep, I get up and eat ice cream. I just wanted to find one other pair of eyes being like, what a dumb cunt. Right? But nothing. No one, they're all looking at her like, Bridget, you should be asleep. Bridget, tonight, carbs come up. So that's my turn. And I don't look at my friend Katie. I just feel her just glaring at me. Just like, don't be yourself right now, bitch. This is my new life. And so I'm like, okay, first of all, Bridget, thank you for being so brave. I'll admit this. It's kind of like your ice cream thing. One time, I let a cab driver finger me. And Katie's like, that's not how you play Amy. I'm like, really? Because I feel like I won. Thank you. You guys, you're an amazing crowd. Thank you so much. Oh, God, dad died. I guess like today. I'm going to talk about it on stage. Yeah, yeah. You should open with it.

 I'm not a dancer, I can't dance, you can look at me until I can. I just learned this shit here. Just got the motherfucker, just hey, hey! People look at you like you're gonna do that shit, no? You kiss my ass motherfucker. I just learned this shit, that's what got me on too. Now these hip-hop motherfuckers out here, man. I don't do it, little Jerry curl checking the room, that's what I'm looking for. Alright, don't get scared now, hang on, point you out in the shit. That's good, that's good, you know curls in the room. Oh, you know curl street, brother, you right on the goddamn street. And your shit's moist, I like that. You gotta keep your shit moist if you got a curl. Nothing in the world worse than a dry ass Jerry curl. Cause you, yo shit's moist, you took time to moist in your shit. You was in the mirror at home before you got here moistening your shit. You take a long time to moist in your shit, you been in the mirror going, you're gonna be in the mirror. You're gonna be in the mirror. You're gonna be in the mirror. You're gonna be in the mirror. And then you look at the man's bump, I think I need another bottle. This is great, this is great, I love this shit man. I'm getting older man, I'm getting older, that's cool, it's cool, ain't I? It's just dry, goddamn. God damn, you shit, you shit's dry. I like that no girl, I like that no girl. But I like this, this is younger cross, I'm getting older, I'm getting older. You know when you get older, when you get older you speak different, right? Like younger, y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all speak different, it's a different type of language, y'all get help, it's a help language, you're universal, you've seen it, and they ride, what's up? In the head move, you've seen that? Amen, what's up? How you doing? You ever seen that? I'm gonna first, I'm gonna fuck where you go, they do it. Oh man, what's up? Then, then, when you get older like my age, you know, my man, I'm here like my daddy, my daddy don't do that shit. Oh man, speak differently, oh man, speak like this. Watch out there now. Oh man, don't do that. That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna fuck where you go, you know? I'm gonna fuck where you go. I'm gonna fuck where you go, you know? Oh man, keep going. Oh man, keep going. Come on, keep going. Come on, keep going. Love it, shit. Not in the world, man. That's making people laugh. I love it. Best job in the world. You get to see shit. You get to talk about shit. They say I have a commercial in Atlanta. I should live in Atlanta. I don't even know if they played it here. It was a cool-aid commercial. I'm gonna come here. The lady was on there. She'd come on the radio. She'd go, who's gonna call the Kool-Aid? Remember that? And look, girl, it go, dad. Dad, I'm gonna call the Kool-Aid. Oh, people go into Kool-Aid. Just, oh, God damn. What the hell is the bastard doing all the Kool-Aid? They didn't even swallow that motherfucker. Hold on now. Don't beat my kids in the moment. That's what I like about black people. We beat our kids. We forked their ass. We beat the fuck out of them. My daddy used to walk, man. Come on, come, come here. Stand right there. Hold your lips up here. Now get outside and play. Whop your ass. And then you got these people. You know who we are. I've seen you in the store. Some sad shit. You don't beat the kids. You don't beat them. You just grabbed them up, fuckers, and shake the fuck out. You never seen them. Just, you, fuck, you, fuck your ass. God damn, it's gonna rock out. Shake the fuck out. Son, get to... Well, the fun has a lucky piece out in your head. Thank you all, man.

 That is the type of forced, fraudulent, crowd response that will propel my outfit. I'm a lawyer, I can sue you. He actually said that, I'm a lawyer, I can sue you. Because as you know, only lawyers can sue people. He's so lucky he had that job. Otherwise, man, yeah man, lay hand on me. You'd be crazy not to. You will get away with it. I work at a magic shop. Sadly, I'm not a lawyer. All lawsuits just lawyers suing people who punch them in the face. I'd like to see that trial. Well, you're on it all started when I felt the need to yell titties out for 20 straight minutes. Oh, well this is going to be a short one. I find in favor of anyone who punched you in the face. Boom. Titties. It's talking to Chris Rock the other day, not to name drop. He said, I told him I was doing this especially because it started out with a really solid joke. It seems that's what I've done. I walked around my neighborhood, walked past a girl scout selling cookies at a table with her mom next door. I walked close to the table. I saw the girl scout was signing autographs for people. As I go, you movie star. Her mom's like, her pictures on the box. I looked down at the box. Her picture was on the box. I'd never seen this before. I freaked out. Then I got a little competitive. I was like, well, the only reason I asked is I'm actually a movie star. I don't know what movies you've seen at your young age, little jandy, but I bet you saw one called Pudy Tang. You remember the guy in the car? You're talking to him. What about the wrestler? Do you see that one, little jandy? I got to go to the Venice Film Festival for the premiere. They made me pay my own way, but when I got there, they let me watch a movie. Yeah, $3,300 flight. 700 for a Toxian. Anyway, give me a box of Samoa's. Make it out to Todd. Good to be back on stage at a real venue. Comics are doing some weird gigs over this pandemic. Used to be a get a text from a cog. Have you done that new club in St. Louis? Did they put you up in a nice hotel? And now it's like, have you done that fire escape show on Staten Island? How many hand washing stations do that? Been tested for COVID like 38 times. At some point I realized it's something to do. I was like, oh, this is an activity, isn't it? This should be in time out in New York's free stuff to do this week. I'd hear about a testing site that had an hour away at a big hour. That'll work. So I can find one with a two hour wait. Try to make it a social event called my friend fill up. I go fill. Let's go get tested together. Be gray. We'll walk six feet apart. Stand in line six feet apart. Be a great COVID hang. So I thought I don't need to get tested. I've been quarantining. And also I need to go to the Apple store. You can do both of us. Rhymes me with time I was in solitary confinement and need to go to supercuts. Want to get a COVID test and they're sitting on a swab each nostril for 10 seconds. This is the way she counted. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. I was like, you know, I'm a busy guy but I did block off the full 20 seconds. I wasn't looking for express service on this. I'd hate to get stitches for me. I'm going to give you 10 stitches. One, two, nine, 10. Get out of here. I just freed up some time in your day to show off your gaping wound. We got mad if you got the vaccine too soon. You hear these conversations, you get vaccinated? Yeah. Oh, how'd that happen? Oh, I have asthma. Oh, you have asthma. That's interesting. I'm saying I've known you for two hours. You've never mentioned that you have asthma. Got mine a little early. Got my sticker saying I got vaccinated. Posted on Instagram. Thought people would be happy for me somewhere. Others were like, I want to know how you got that vaccine. Then someone else wrote in, yeah, I was about to ask them that myself. Then the third person, like, you guys both beat me to the punch on this one. How do you get that jab? It's like calm down, fellas. I'm about to post a screenshot of my medical records. It is your business. It's really good about wearing my mask. I've got a few actual altercations with anti-maskers. Cannot believe how brave I was. I'd be at bed bath in the honor of like, hey, you. Talk and use 17-year-old stock clerk. See the guy by the salad spinners? No mask. Get him. Yeah, grab that set of carving knives. That's a big dude. Your little guy. And I'm headed for the exit. I'm not even going to pay for these scrub datties. I was in Burlington, Vermont, got into a taxi and I saw the driver didn't have a mask on. I said, do you have a mask you can put on? He's like, I do, but you're not going to like it. I'm going to like it. Please pull out the hilarious novelty mask. This guy pulls out a mask. His Biden is useless as his mask. Oh, you got him. Powerful stuff. He's going to be said if he ever reads that, if he's straddling your rearview mirror. Then the guy said, this new variant, it's just bronchitis. That's what my doctor told me. What was your doctor adjusting your back while I told you that? Oh, yeah. Settle chiropractor reference. Always brings the house down. Good year for doctors to be on TV. Sanjay Gupta, oh my god, they put that guy to work. Special early on the pandemic, he'd be on CNN like I have one, I'm Sanjay Gupta, I'm a neurosurgeon. And today I'm going to teach you how to sanitize a nutrient grain bar. I repeat, I'm a neurosurgeon. I do brain surgery. I could be doing brain surgery right now. In fact, someone isn't getting brain surgery. Because I'm standing here with a tub of chlorox wipes about to teach you how to do something you don't actually need to do. But more on that in eight months. That's a learn how to cook during the pandemic, went on TikTok for recipes. Every recipe on TikTok is speed oriented. Look you want to make a 25 second breakfast? Start the clock. Start to embrace the idea of cooking. But then there's always that ingredient deal breaker. I'll be watching the chef on the screen, I'll go, come on man, you think I have rice vinegar? You know I don't have rice vinegar. Look at me, you know I don't have. Three people in the world have rice vinegar. You and your two roommates. You realize how lazy it was about cooking. I'd read the directions on a microwave burrito. I'd be like, heat on high for one minute, then flip over. I didn't go to the cord on blue, culinary, I'm going to see if I can slam this out in one step. No basting. Glad to read now again, I've had some great exchanges with waiters and waitresses over the years. This is an actual exchange act with a waiter and Italian restaurant in New York City, not too long ago. Hi, is it possible to get a decaf espresso? You're the worst. Okay. I don't mean to be all lawyerly, but that was a yes or no question. But if you want to go with the year the worst, that works fine. Anyway, give me a decaf espresso with a big spoon of ketchup in it. Now I'm really bad. It's in a diner in Oklahoma. I ordered a salad and she goes, what kind of dressing I said Italian? She leaned in whispered something to me, but I didn't understand her, go, what's that? She goes like, it's not good. What's not good? The Italian dressing. It's not good. It's not good. It's not good about it. It's not that tangy. Maybe you and I have different standards for tangy. Which dressing should I get? I'd go with a thousand island. I don't like thousand island. I'll have the Italian. Are you sure it's not good? What part of it's not good, don't you understand? We'll end that one right there. It feels like four points I could have gotten out of that joke and just kept going. It felt so comfortable with you guys. It's been really good before the pandemic started taking a Pilates class. It's just me and three women who knew how to do Pilates. Instructor always had to make adjustments. Let's do that thing when we hang from a bar and do jumping jacks and sit ups at the same time. Todd, here's some crayons. Why don't you mark up the wall for me, Todd? Draw an owl for me. Big owl with a lot of detail. All right ladies, we're going to stand on our hands and put a hundred pound weights on the balls of your feet. Todd, I don't know. Download a Scrabble app. Or leave. Yeah, I want you to leave. I like that idea best. Walking's good exercise. Walk on Adder. Yes, I see your t-shirt. This is I Heart Pilates. Hit the road. That's a Chicago. That's a pretty cool city, huh? That was, I took a pandering course earlier in the day. And they said to say that on stage. How much is a house here? What's that? Nine? Nine what? Nine dollars? Oh my God. Note to self. Talk to someone else. Department just sold a New York City bought by a hedge fund manager. $238 million. $24,000 square feet. If I had a 24,000 square foot apartment New York, I'd still be telling people from out of town. I'm not really set up for guests. Yeah, it's just a one bedroom apartment with a 53 home offices. Yeah, you're welcome to crash, but you'd be sleeping with your head on a fax machine. The upkeep must be ridiculous on that place. You'd be at home. I don't know if you want to go to the movies today. I'd love to. We really need to go to bedbath and be on it by 35,000 swiffer sheets. I can't even imagine a 24,000 square foot apartment. My apartment is 800 square feet, and I'm a celebrity. So I have to become a hedge fund manager. You get a bigger place or worse than that. Find out what a hedge fund manager is. Again. Tried like 500 times. People start explaining to me, you know what's not going to happen. I'll try again in six weeks. Everything's expensive in New York. I went to buy new glasses, eye glasses, went to a boutique place. I go, how much are these glasses? The guy said they're a thousand dollars. I was like, oh, that's kind of expensive. He's like, well, think of it this way. You'll have them for three years. It's like a dollar a day. Well, when you put it that way, it sounds more expensive. I asked you how much these glasses are, and you said you have to give me a dollar a day, every day for three years. I'd be like, wow, that is a pricey pair of glasses. I'm doing the math in my head. I'd say that's roughly $1,000. Why don't I take $1,000 by two pairs of $200 glasses, and also a round trip ticket to Barcelona? Now I'm glad we're traveling again. A few years ago, I went to Bangkok. Almost didn't go. I saw a video on YouTube called The Scams of Bangkok. This dude was a little paranoid. I was like, if you go to a museum, and you see someone smiling, total scam. If you go to a restaurant, they have noodles on the menu. Your identity has just been stole. If you show up at your hotel, there's a front desk called Interpol. Classic flimflam. Can't believe I've barely done any crowd work. What do you think? How's it going? What's your name? What do you do, Chris? I don't think I want to do crowd work tonight. Design engineer? What does that mean? OK. I'm in the business. I'm in the business. I'm in the business. I get this. I was just going to upgrade these recess lights. It's good talking to Chris. We just took a recess from being funny. Always dead. I pulled that one out. I'm trying out Airbnb's on the road. You got to read those listings very closely. They always start out good. It's like on a tree line street close to shops and restaurants. Oh, I like that. You'll have the whole place yourself. I let my neighbor store's guns in my linen closet. Yeah, not sure I feel about that. So he might pop in from time to time. Definitely don't like that. But don't worry as a kid who that makes me worry. Also, there's a great home theater system. You're not allowed to use it. Stay out of the kitchen. And there's a python under the sofa. You must feed him 15 times a day. But to reiterate, you'll have the whole place yourself. Close to shops and restaurants. Always get nervous booking an Airbnb because my pictures and my profile. I know the hosts are going, oh my god, honey. You're not going to believe who's sleeping in our attic tonight. I'll give you a clue, small but pivotal role in Pudy 10. Todd Berry is sleeping in our attic. Yeah, he can't afford a hotel, I guess not. Let's get the good pillows out for him. I said hotel in Los Angeles. When I got back, I realized I left my toiletribeck at the hotel in Los Angeles. And it was a really nice one sent to me by the cartoon network. I had cartoons all over it. I wanted it back. I called out the hotel I got housed in room 318. I left my toiletribeck, it's got cartoons all over it. I was like, oh yeah, we found that. I was like, great, can I get it back? Can you describe the cartoons? Did you think I was calling you on the off chance? That's someone left behind the toiletribeck with cartoons on it. Like I'm in the market for one. I wanted to find one, some calling hotels all day long. Hoping for a miracle. Maybe I got an anonymous tip. Some guy comes up to me in an alley town, don't ask why I am. If you're in the market for half a bottle of dandruff shampoo and five dusty viagras. Call this hotel, tell me in your room 318. He left your toiletribeck, it's got cartoons all over it. What kind of cartoons they'll never ask you that. Why would they ask you that? Be crazy to ask you that. Straight clap there. Took an Uber in the Midwest and at the end of the ride, the driver said, Sir I owe you an apology. I was like, for what? Because I'm sorry I didn't talk during the trip. I really like to focus on my driving. It's like, while there are apologies, I've been waiting 35 years for. This guy hits me with the most unnecessary apology. It's like, sir, if you're apologizing for not making me talk to a stranger for an hour and a half, guess what, all's forgiven. Maybe it doesn't always go that way. Maybe sometimes like, sir, I want to apologize for not talking during the trip. Yeah, what was with that, man? You see me back here all alone, son? Just a man in his French horn. Mmm. I played the French horn in middle school. So I was able to nail that tone. At least the guy apologizes, oh that was nice. I like apologies. I even like shitty apologies. My favorite shitty apologies, the convenient apology. Or someone will only apologize because they ran into you. It's always something that happened a long time ago. It's like, hey, Tom, I'm glad I ran into you, man. Remember we were at that party recently? That was 1991. I got a little drunk, you got really drunk. I said a few things I shouldn't have said. You said a lot of things you should have said. I think I beat the shit out you did beat the shit out. Anyway, I just want to say I'm sorry. Well, I appreciate that, Scott, to think this would have happened if I went to my usual frozen yogurt shop. Let's do some more crowd wear. Whoa. Calm down, seven o'clock, shall. What's your name? Brenna. BRENNA. What do you do, Brenna? Holy shit. You got any stories? What's the most exciting house about the bear and the car? Really? In the car? The car you were driving in? In the car. You looked outside and there was a bear on the car. Someone would argue that you weren't looking outside. I looked outside inside the car. That's a good story. Cut that one. Cutting room floor. How did you react to the bear? There you go. There's not open doors. Save that one also. I was talking to a guy in the audience asking what he did for a living. He goes, I'm a cabinet salesman. I was like, do you like it? I was like, what do you love about being a cabinet salesman? I like having dinner with my customers. I don't know if that was a wine and dine, since we're all in stall. I love them. They're all in stall. I guess it's Beastro time. Time for the traditional post-cabinet installation. Celebratory dinner. What are you hangin' for? I'm sorry I'm havin' dinner with the guys who steamed clean my drapes. It's been quite a day. Breakfast with my exterminator. Happy hour drinks with my plumber. I'm gonna have lunch tomorrow. You know what I'm going to Apple picking with the guys who regra out of my bathroom top? This is a true story. I was in New Orleans on tour about six months ago and I started that show. I met the guy who was a cabinet salesman. The guy yells out, that was me. I looked down. It was him. What a thrill for that dude, man. Imagine sitting there and I do a joke about you. It's unbelievable. I'm so happy for the guy. That might happen with the bear story. I still don't know where the bear was. I'm so happy for the guy. I don't know if it's inside or outside there. Yeah, she locked the door. I don't know if it's inside or outside there. Yeah, she locked the door. From the outside of the bear's inside. I guess we'll never know. My printer broke recently. Sorry. The Bamiya. The light flash that's at Paper Jam. It's a printer tech supporter. Let me go do a little research on Paper Jam. Did I lay a new term on you? Isn't that the problem you make fun of at the call center? The phone rings. I wonder if there's going to be a paper jam. Oh, shit it is. It's like calling up a steakhouse and asking if they know about baked potatoes. It's like calling me up and asking me if I know about standing ovation. Oh my god. I can't believe you applauded at that. I feel so guilty. I can be a dick sometimes. I feel like feeling intellectually superior. I was at a bar in Austin, Texas. The guy next to me was talking to the bartender. He said, I like the last drink you made me more better than this one. I was like, ooh. We got ourselves a dumb dumb. A full of 30 seconds passes. The guy turns me, he's like, did I just say more better? It's like how do you make that mistake and then catch that mistake? I liked it more better when you didn't know how to talk. I got that more better joke work. Month ago, that was dead in the water. Then I'd come here and it's such a successful moment in the show. Wow. That was my bear story. I had a beard for a while. Then I got a girlfriend who doesn't like beards and she's really subtle about it. She'd say things like, oh, you have a beard, huh? Some of my friends like guys with beards. It's like, oh, that's weird. Some of my friends like when people say things directly. There's a true story. I got an audition for that show Billions and I told her about it. She's like, do you have to shave for your audition? Only question she had about the other. You have to shave for it. It's not, I don't have to shave for it. It's an audition. It's not like they're going to watch my taping. Oh, my God, he's perfect. But this character's clean shaven. There's no easy fix for this. We'll go with Daniel Day Lewis. My girlfriend's from rural Oregon and she wanted to go camping. She's like, do you even know how to put up a tent? I was like, no, I don't. She's like, that's a good skill to have. What if there's an emergency and I'm incapacitated? Never thought of that. Whenever I've thought of emergencies, that one's not come up. No, I know one. What's your emergency? My girlfriend was attacked by a bear. Sarah, calm down. Do you know how to assemble a tent? I know what I was hoping you'd send medical attention. We're not sending medical attention. Sir, we're sending five REI employees. Now, make some smores and hang tight till they get there. I don't know anything about sports. My girlfriend knows more about sports than I do. I actually asked her this question. I go, do you stand up or lie down on a snowboard? I was like three months ago, she just stopped laughing 10 minutes ago. I've never heard any laugh that slapped my life. I was like, baby, laugh in my amazing jokes, not my perfectly reasonable questions. I got to look for red flags in relationships. I look looking for red flags in other people's relationships, especially before they even have one. That's the best. Someone's all excited about a potential new romance. They talk to me. I'd bum them out. It's great. His friend of mine was going on a first day, like, where are you going? She was going to meet at a bar tomorrow night at 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock. Ooh, red flag. But he works late at the hospital. He works at a hospital. Ooh, second red flag. He's a highly respected surgeon. Ooh, third red flag. He's a huge fan of your comedy. This guy sounds horrible. I got an email from my doctor's office telling me my doctor is becoming something called a concierge doctor, meaning there's a $2,300 annual fee just to see her, and I still have to pay for all the appointments. Email said it's a great program. You get a special phone number where you can text your doctor 24 hours a day. A special phone number. You mean the doctor's phone number? I can text her 24 hours a day. Okay, dear doctor. Sorry to bother you at 4 a.m. on your burner phone. But I have a really important question. Can I take a third, Advil? I implore you to write back before five. My head is pounding. Sorry to find a good doctor. Sorry to find a good doctor. The doctor to find is a therapist. One of my insurance companies website looking for a therapist. That'll list a therapist who take the insurance and you can sort them by distance. It seemed like a weird way to find a therapist. That's the way I find a dry cleaner. I can't imagine that someone's like, I'm really depressed, but if you make me walk more than two minutes, for excellent care, I'll be really, really depressed. Imagine ending up at that therapist. You found sorting by distance. I'd be at that first deployment taught. I got to ask you, how did you find me? Oh, your office is in my building. I live directly upstairs. I woke up 11 seconds ago. Thought you looked familiar to me. I'd probably seen you in the hallway. I'd never seen you in the hallway. It was your small but pivotal role in pity time. Pity time. That's a weird word to mispronounce. Hey, you said, Poodie Tang wrong. Okay. Thank you, God, the joke. Therapists have websites now. I'm going to read the book. Therapists have websites now. I saw a therapist website and a link to his Twitter page. It's like, oh, do you have tour dates and merch also? I clicked on this guy's Twitter page. I saw he followed a bunch of comedians. I was like, oh, not going to this guy. I don't want a comedy nerd. It's my therapist. Obviously, appointment crime. I was out dog. I feel awful. What should I do? Well, Tariya thought of doing something nice for someone else. Maybe that'll make you feel better. Like what? I don't know. Why don't you hook me up with Bill Bear tickets? I don't know if that's going to help, Doc. Didn't help when I gave you Pat and Oswald's email address. And you got to stop writing to him. He's not going to read that script. I read somewhere that the most marked up bottle of wine on a restaurant's wine list is the second cheapest. Reason they do that is, got to be on a date to embarrass them by the cheapest wine, picks a second cheapest, and gets destroyed. Probably the best thing I've ever read my entire life. It's like, who can we screw over here at the restaurant? How about a guy looking for love who's also on a budget? That's why I hired you, PJ. You're an IDM man. See his bottle of peanut on a wire costs us a dollar 50. Let's go 600 on this one. Better love cooking shows and shows about travel and stuff like that. I was actually on the Seth Meyers show once, years ago. And the other guest was Anthony Bourdain. I got to meet him real briefly. And I'm glad it was a brief meeting because I don't want to be backstage trading road stories with Anthony Bourdain. He said, yeah, remember once, I was in South America, got bitten by a snake while I was trying to eat at small intestine. Well, yeah, I was once at a hampton in in Little Rock. And they ran out of Captain Crunch at the breakfast buffet. I get it. Poor guy must have had annoying fans when you're traveling food expert. People running up to you on the street, Anthony, here's the deal. I'm going to Malaysia and I love turkey burgers. Anthony Bess Rice Krispie Treat and Paraguay. Let's hear it. Anthony, I'm going to Düsseldorf and I love Empanyadas. I need your top five. Like that show chopped. That's a great show. Four chefs compete for a $10,000 prize. My favorite part about that show is none of the chefs have a realistic grasp of what you can buy for $10,000. I was like, chef, what do you do if you win the $10,000? Well, I've always wanted to travel around the world for a year. Flying first class everywhere. How you can do that for another $1.3 million? Here's what you're going to do. You can fly first class to Cleveland. Take a megabust to Columbus. Flyback premium economy from Columbus with a five hour layover in Cleveland. Then you're out of money. Chef, what do you do if you win $10,000? It's about six brothers that left about the Meacher Rolls Royce. Here's what you're going to do. You're going to buy three decent skateboards. Then you make a little sign up. A sheet of your brothers can take turns. Chef, what do you do if you win the $10,000? I think it'd be great to buy my mom a house. That'd be the greatest. Buy your mom a sweet $10,000 house. Here's what you're going to do. You're going to buy yourself an updated food processor. Then the best wooden spoon. Then you can make your mom some dip. And she can enjoy it in the house she currently lives in. Not the $10,000 before taxes dream house. Also known as the $3,000 house. Also known as a used minivan. It's fun being a comedian work a night. Have all day to have some weird days. Had a weird day recently went to the podiatrist. Then I adopted a kitten. That was my to-do list for a Tuesday. That was great. I was at the podiatrist office stretched out looking down on my little toes. I was like, aww. I can't imagine anything cuter than that. 40 minutes later, holy shit. What was I thinking? Finally found something cuter than my little toes. Little baby kitty cat. It's fun being a new cat owner. Get to buy your stuff. I was on Amazon looking at cat treats. Found the brand of cat treat. There's a bunch of reviews next to it. So all there was one star review. Is that cool? I got to read a one star review of a cat treat. This was the entire review. My cat didn't like this. Guys, I just keyboard. I'm going to keep this lean and lean. My cat didn't like this. I could just see that guy at home. Hey, pockets come here. Got some new treats for the child. What do you think? Oh, you don't like them? Don't worry. Daddy will bank her up the company. What just tried different brand? Don't be so petty. You don't be so polite pockets. I'm going to crush them. Made a mistake of getting a kitten instead of an adult cat. That's a mistake. I'm horrible. Oh, my God. I didn't know it was in for. She attacks me while I'm trying to sleep. It's gotten so bad I've actually checked into hotels. I've checked into the closest hotel in my apartment three different times to get some sleep. Probably $5,000 worth of hotel rent. It's a great check in. Now you walk in. No bags. Bleeding. So you hear for business, sir? No, actually a kid in a taxi. Oh, where are you coming in from? Look outside. See that building 50 feet away? See that light on the seventh floor? See that kitten in the window? Yeah, the one drinking a glass of rose. Smoking a cigarette with one of those long holders. Oh, she's holding up a sign. Todd Barry is overrated. Where does a kitty learn that word? It's incomprehensible. Supposed to brush my cats teeth. I was sprung on recently by that. You got to start brushing your teeth. I was like, OK, I wouldn't have gotten the cat. Just saying how I know and I wouldn't have considered it for one second. That's too late. I love her. So I went on YouTube looking for tutorials. How to brush your cats teeth. Thought there might be one or two. There's thousands of them. All the same, none of them are helpful. They're all like, here's how you brush your cats teeth. First start out with the world's most relaxed cat. You got that? No, I don't got that. Shockingly, I do not have that. Placer carefully on this table specifically designed to examine animals. You can get one at your local veterinary supplies store for $6,000. I'll take the toothbrush and toothpaste out. Watch what happens. Oh my god, she took it from my hand. She's taking the cat off the toothpaste. She's brushing her own teeth. Where'd you get a water pick, baby? She snuck off the target and bought a water pick. Supposed to schedule play time with the cat. I don't know. I don't want to play with my cat. I want a shark tank with my cat. We'll call that playing. Come here, baby. Sit in my lap. We're going to play. That's good. $500,000 for 2% equity. Rang! Yeah, that's bullshit. Rang, yeah, it's bad valuation, baby. Rang, yeah, they better have some cells. The apartment I live in charges me $50 a month because of a cat. It's like a little spiteful pet pee they have. Remember being in the leasing office, sign a lease. Guys like, so it's just you and the apartment? Yeah, it just made my cat. Also, it's not just you and the park. There's also something this big living there. Yeah, she's the size of my toaster. You have a toaster? You got to come clean with me, my man. I have a couple of spoons also. Okay, we're going to go 50 to the cat, 30 for the toaster. Eight bucks each for the spoons. I can make that joke last 19 hours if I want to do it. Think of all the objects I didn't mention. They have cat cafes now. Coffee shops with cats roaming around in them. They're great. I want to want a new Orleans. The only thing better going to cat cafe going to a cat cafe alone. The only thing better going to a cat cafe alone showing up and being the only customer at the cat cafe. It's just me in 150 cats. I was just walking around like I was the king. Tell me about the gray one. Seems a bit moody for a domestic short hair. Why is the tabby not playing with a ragamuff and they should be friends? Let's try a coffee. Mmm, delicious. Coffee always tastes best when you drink in your seven litter boxes. That's a lot of cat jokes, huh? Let's change the subject, shall we? That's my cat. That's a little perch that's suction cup to the window. Sometimes the suction cup comes down and I don't fix it for a while. Her name is Michaeline. She's a foreign correspondent for Al Jazeera. Close up with a face. Here, let me show you. That's her face. I hope you can't tell where I live based on that. Now you're saying Todd, how do we know that's really your cat? Boom. Same cat as you just looked at. That's me. Happy miserable. Happy miserable. Oh, that's me and Slash. That's Slash. That's me. That's Slash. Slash came to my show in London, came straight from the airport. Hi, friends. I've known 20 years who asked to be on my guest list and don't show up. Slash is like, we're going to clear customs and head right over. Oh, man. I can't show this one in New York because people get mad. I'm a washer and dryer. I'm a celebrity, of course I do. Oh, that is the front right side of my couch. It's a fancy couch that's got exposed wood. Not sure what that is, probably a million dollar contract or something. That's the rear right of my couch. She's got more work to do on that one. Oh, that's me with Lars from Metallica. That's me. That's Lars. Me, Lars. Can't invite you to my show in Northern California. Look how happy he is. Here, you know what? You saw that guy walking down the street with that smile. Did you just go to a Todd Berish? Oh, that's the front left of my couch. Someone came up to me after a show where he's like, you know, you should get scratching posts. I didn't know about scratching posts. You mean they have special posts? Oh, my God. I have 13 scratching posts. That's the rear left of my couch. That's a speaker that fell over six months ago. In order to fix that, I'd have to lean down and put it back up, right? Oh, that's me and Charlize Theran. This is me giving a masterclass in how to play it cool. Thank you very much, folks. Have a good evening. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Look at this. Look at the jazz. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Thank you.

 The of the of ten Please welcome to the bring now, Mr. Hant, great! Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being here. All right, how's this, huh? One more top of the green mill everybody, this place is fantastic. What an honor to be doing this at the green mill. Whoever said stand up couldn't be cool was right. But they did not know that I would be shooting a special at the green mill and calling it Top Gun 3. It's good to see you guys, good to be out, good to share your biology again, huh? It was a while, it was a long couple years there. I handled COVID like I always handled herpes. A tested negative. And there's just no way that's right. There's no way. There's no way that's right, just based on where I've been. I'm going to say those are false negatives. I'll tell you this though, if the vaccine was for herpes we wouldn't be fighting like this as a country. Nobody would be dragging their heels on the herpes vaccine. 0.0 US Americans are not getting the herpes vaccine. Chicago, nobody's walking off the job because they didn't want to get the herpes vaccine. No firefighters are trading their pensions for cold source guys. That's what I'm trying to say. No truck drivers are clogging up a bridge because they're mad about the herpes vaccine mandate. I don't know if you guys know any truck drivers but they're going to be the first ones to get the herpes vaccine. 10.4 good buddy, I'll take 10 more for all my favorite ladies at the gasoline yard. So them guys can get back to work. Oh, that's good. I'm good. Right before the pandemic I got my identity theft. The taken. Stolen. Married is what I'm married. I got married. Come on, she's a wonderful woman. How would you confuse those two things? It felt like a bit of a smashing grab. I gotta be honest. Everything I thought I knew gone in an instant. No, she's wonderful. She's a better person than me, my wife. That's a risk. Being with a better person than you, you know what I'm talking about. Because now it's in my head every day I wake up, maybe she just did this because I look like I needed help. I don't need that kind of doubt in my life. I don't need that kind of doubt in my life. Do I got a sandbag this? If I get functional does she move on to the next town? Like Bruce Banner? Save some other elderly fuck boy. I don't want to disappoint her but I can't have her thinking her work here is done. Every once in a while I suggest we get a roommate. Just to keep runner toes. Now you guys, I'm sorry, I do have to kind of got a power through this tonight. I finally got my booster shot and now I can't feel my freedom. Thank you. I'm serious. Right when the needle hit my skin. Right when the needle hit my skin I can feel my pocket constitution burst into flames. Right there in my banana republic cargo pants. I had to get a new set of cargo pants. I lost a perfectly good pair of outlet mall tactical cargo pants to that damn booster shot. Right when the science was soaking into my loins I could feel my musket slip out of my hands. Right there into the Potomac. I went from Walgreens to the Potomac to apologize to the ghost of George Washington. And he wouldn't look me in my eyes and I panicked and I dropped my musket and floated to the bottom where Rachel Maddow was waiting. With her bony little mad al fingers and she caught my musket and she kept it. Not cool science. Not cool. Not good job science. Proud of you. But people aren't impressed by science anymore. They're not impressed. Start throwing curveball science. Give them something to look at. Here you go science, when you impress me give a pig a person heart. Just one time science. You never even thought about that. We're constantly giving people pig hearts. What do they do? They lay around, they sleep and eat, they do a bunch of pig stuff. Yeah, it's boring. It's boring. Just one time make me a pig and do some people stuff science. One time make me a pig that can join a climbing gym or make me a pig I can enjoy a rom-com with. Science. Guys, don't worry. My wife is a nurse which makes me a doctor. And... It's been a good year. It's been a good year to be a brand new doctor. Because I mean now more than ever we need real medical professionals. Now more than ever, half the country got PhDs on YouTube last year. So I'll fight that fight. Somebody said some nonsense to me. I'll look them straight in the face. I'll stack some shit I halfway listened to. Right up on top of something else I changed a channel before they were done explaining it. I'll push it right across the bar, if they're asked. Call it research. You gotta call it research. That way they know you didn't read it. Don't like it when you read some shit. That calls into question. They're work ethic and the whole conversation is lost. I'll call it research to their mother fucking face and then they know they're dealing with a medical professional. I hope everybody's okay. I hope everybody's okay. Did anybody else lose a family member to QAnon? The real pandemic? My name's Nate. I'm from Wisconsin. I was born in Indiana through a tire swing. So this QAnon shit is affecting me directly. If you don't know what QAnon is, it's a video game that hillbillies get to live inside of. And I was not prepared. I had never lost a cousin to Super Mario Brothers before. What it is, that's what it is. It's a, it's Super Mario Brothers. If the princess were supposed to save is my cousin's wife. Mandy. Tell me more Mandy. Everything I know about QAnon. I know from Mandy's Instagram story. I guess, I guess that the Democratic Party and the Hollywood elite, which I am one of, are running a baby huffing dungeon where they huff the steam off of babies. That's how they get their power. That's why Nancy Pelosi's dentures look like they're going to eat her own face every morning. Just snorting at hot, hot baby steam. Also, maybe in just real quick, in defense of baby huffing, is some of the country not huffing babies? It's one of the finest things in life. I mean, I don't even have kids. I just, any chance I get to huff a baby I'm doing it. And I would just recommend it. Maybe you'd calm down a little bit, but anyway. No, I will say this though. I think the pandemic was hardest on the whites. Because we already wanted to talk to the manager. We already wanted to talk to the manager. And now everybody wanted to talk to the manager. That line used to be all ours. And now we had to do it through a mask. Obviously, we had to do it through a mask. We had to explain the constitution. We had to pretend that we read the constitution. Through a mask. While destroying a beachwear display. To somebody that might not be the manager. I mean, we'll do it. We did it. And we'll do it again. If that's what we have to do. If that's what we have to do to protect against the things that are founding fathers warned us against. We will leave no self-checkout screen unslabbered upon. So that we can explain personal sovereignty to somebody that just smoked weed in a loading dock. That is what my people will do for you. You ever even thought about that? Others? Nobody wants to work anymore. I want everyone's fire. I want everyone associated with this decision. Fire! It's easy, asshole. Nobody wants to work anymore. Nobody wants to help you. Just don't be the biggest asshole at Bevmo. And you're good. You want people to help you just be in line in front of that guy. And they'll do everything that you need. It's a good person. They'll carry your plastic vodka bottles to your Rev 4 for you, buddy. I want everyone fired. Nobody wants to work. That Kim Kardashian told me that on Instagram. Nobody wants to work anymore. Nobody wants to work. Give back to work. Thanks, Kim. Really appreciate it. Wrong messenger. You know what I mean? Wrong messenger. Thank you, Kim. What happened, Kim? Did nobody help you at the implant warehouse? Do you have any more opinions? You can help us through this. The current landscape of corporate servitude, Kim. What are your opinions on Automization, Kim? I would bet the middle third of my dick. That Kim Kardashian never changed a vacuum bag. Get in there, Kim. Fight the good fight. Let us know your thoughts on mechanization when you get a shot. Thanks very much for coming out. Especially parents. You did the heavy lifting in that pandemic. You really did. I appreciate you. I don't know. Anybody else without kids? Did you guys call your friends with kids during the pandemic? Oh man. Just chaos. It was chaos. My buddy Ari. He was a stay-at-home dad during the pandemic. He's got a three-year-old and a five-year-old. I would call him and just every call sounded like he'd called 911 and dropped the phone. He would answer, too, right? Because he was all day for him. He's like, oh, dude, dude. What's up? Dude, hold on. Are you bleeding? What's going on? What's happening? Sadie. No. Sadie. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no No, no, no, no, no, no, no hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on my neck. Let me hug you. No, no, hold on my neck. Oh baby, my neck. Oh baby, my neck. My neck. Oh baby, my neck. And Tisou, hold on, dude, I got, bro, I got cheers, I don't know being bike cheers, there's cheers, and every car I got. Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, twin brother, Sandad laughs and I got to call you back. He could drop the phone in his minivan. I'd be in my garage with no responsibilities. Just like, oh my God. Smoking weed, like what's gonna happen to say to you? Tune in next week to see if say to get Sir Juice. Oh. I think I'd be a good dad. It's almost hurtful. I'm a good person. I know it's not something a good person has to say. My worst fear is getting a kid stuck in a ceiling fan. You ever do that? You're a tall guy. You never jam a kid up in a ceiling fan? Never once? What do you got? That nice high-lofted ceilings in your condo that you own? It's convenient. Nobody ever rents their ceiling fans anymore. I'm the only one. I'm the only one with six-foot-five-inch ceiling fans. It's just perfect. There he is. My boy. Lewis, not even born yet. It's already got a 16-inch scar above his left eye. I think I'm a good person. Get a kid stuck in a ceiling fan. That's a bad time to find out you're not a good person. I just don't... I think I'll adopt. Get like a 16-year-old. Yeah. You agree with me. It's a good strategy. Get him across a finish line real quick. Pick one with a scholarship. You laugh because it's a foolproof plan. I just don't ever want to have to get an infant through an airport. That looks like rock bottom. You ever see two adults at the airport just getting laughed? By one little organ grinder monkey off its leash. Grab and snacks and harassing federal agents. They're just tangled up in charger cables with no words left, getting a divorce and silence. Just... Fighting over whose turn it is and silence. You ever see an actually outnumbered adult at the airport? That's rock bottom. So I'm mom trying to get three kids through security. She just... Quit in her eyes. It's a dead look in her eyes. She was just... She was kicking shit. She was... Challenging TSA agent. She looked like she wanted to get arrested. She was like, huh? Kicking a bear through the swiper, man. You can't... Like, huh? What? Who? What? These? Yeah. They're mine. This one's got a bomb in her, huh? He's got a gun. She's got a bomb. I'm gonna go somewhere to a room with a couch. Take me to that? Yeah, I'll go. Take me to the room with a couch, where I can close my eyes for the first time in 18 calendar months. I think I'll go to the couch room now, huh? Plusy, how about the couch room? No, I did not pack my own bags. Two brown men, I didn't recognize that. Couch room now? Couch room now? My wife says I'm not nice. Fine. A good person. It can't be both. It's disgusting. She's your good person, doesn't mean you have to be nice. And just because you're nice does not mean you're a good person. The rudest thing anybody ever said to me was, I'll pray for you. Which is a very nice thing to say to someone. If you know they believe what you believe. But if they don't believe what you believe, I'll pray for you. It's a motherfucking threat. I'll pray for you. I'm gonna pray for you. I pray that's okay. Don't worry about that. No, I'll pray for you. No, I'm gonna pray for you. I mean, it's not gonna work. You're gonna be downstairs. You're gonna be bound up. Some sort of trapped in. Some sort of haunt. You're gonna haunt some building someday. You're gonna be in hell for eternity. You're gonna not like your life. You're the eternity that was chosen for you based on your behavior and your demon-like tentations. It's gonna be a bad situation. I'm gonna be upstairs. I'm gonna be up in a different place than you. But I'll pray for you. I'm gonna be getting a foot rub and having by whatever slaves they have up there. But I'll pray for you. No thanks. I got kicked out of Sunday school. No, the rudest thing anybody ever said to me is somebody told me I had resting bitch face. First of all, maybe we take it easy on our bitches. They're resting. How would you like it if every time you tried to take a nap somebody compared you to unhappy people? Also, why are you so familiar with what resting bitches look like? You be spying on bitches? Maybe these bitches should be worried about what you look like. Maybe these bitches should be describing nap time creep face to the authorities. I did get kicked out of Sunday school. That should sound my resume. I grew up in a cathedral. I was just there. My dad was a... I did not sleep there. My dad was the choir director at St. Rayfield's cathedral where I'm from. It's St. Raphael's. But if you're... If you're from Wisconsin, I just found this out. I just realized this. I just realized that it was only because we were in Wisconsin that we pronounced it Rayfield's. I'm sorry. Did you mean Raymond Fields? Yeah, Rayfield. Yeah, like it's a sports bar. Come on down to Rayfield's. Two for ones on Admonishments this week. Free drinks, not just on Sundays anymore. Come on down, Rayfield's. Why watch the game when you can be where it's decided? The good guys always win at Rayfield's. St. Raphael's. And my dad was cheap. He just wanted a free babysitter. He sent me to... He sent me to... Weekday Sunday School. Anybody go to Weekday Sunday School? That's next level Sunday School, if you don't know. If you don't know, if you didn't grow up in a cathedral, under every cathedral, there's a bomb shelter where there's about half a dozen pasty white children with bug-eyed and a couple of nuns telling them about the world. And it's... About... It's a pretty close to a baby huff and dungeon. If you... I mean, it's down in there. It's, you know, it's kind of airtight. You can smell those kids. They're down there. Just learning the same book over and over. And I was seven. I was a prick kid. I didn't have time for this shit. I had just started wondering if Trees Head Souls. I had started wondering what I wanted to believe in in the world. But I wasn't... They throw the book at you. They throw the book at you. And then they dangle Santa Claus, and I didn't like that. I felt like a threat. And I walked in there. My dad was like, quite I didn't need to be there. I walked in like Drake, dude. No new friends. What are you gonna tell me? And the nuns hated me right away. They didn't like me. I'm still open to anything. I'll believe in anything if it's convenient. Anything at all. I wasn't opposed. I definitely didn't know God existed, but I didn't know He didn't. I wasn't sure in any direction. And I'm still not. I don't... Astrology. This is a good example. I don't believe in astrology. Unless somebody doesn't like me. And then I only believe in astrology. What? She said, what? She said, what? What month was she born in? Of course she was born in November. Astrology is a great religion if you need to explain why people don't like you. Christianity is a great religion if you need to explain why you don't like people. And I don't know. I just didn't like... I didn't get... We didn't hit it off. It wasn't a good fit. But I made it two days. The second day was picture day. We had to draw our favorite... I was in. Cranes, I believe in. And I was in. We had to just say to pick our favorite Bible story and just draw that. And I chose Daniel in the Lions then. I just drew Daniel just getting chewed through by five Lions. Just... Oh, one idiot. This guy. Oh, shit. Look at you. Dan. Red Cran, Dan. Look at you. DoA. You are a moron, buddy. I can... I know exactly why God got rid of you. Look at you, buddy. You have another red Cran, please. Thank you very much. Yeah, just get this guy out of here. And... None didn't like it. None didn't like it at all. And... And then, but what she really didn't like was in the corner of the picture. I drew a picture of the sun. The... The ball of fire. That gives us all life. The actual God. Uh... I drew a face on the sun. And I drew arms on the sun going. Eh! And she hated it. She hated it. She hated that I had given the sun a soul. And she took my crayons away and she leaned in. She said, I'll pray for you. No. I know. She was... She was 50. I was seven. That's... That to me, that just said, I know God. And I'm going to tell him what she did. She took my crayons away. That which felt like I think you should leave now. And... And I'm like, fine. I'm going to go look for a God that doesn't care about my crayons. No offense. Cue it on. Reliable religion. Very steady. Demon heavy. Christianity. Hold the Christ. Heavy on the demons. It's just nice to know what's there to use if I need it. If we need it, you know, if you ever need to relegate a significant portion of your fellow citizenry to demon status, you ever need to make a good portion of the people you know murderable. It's nice to know that exists. Other than that, I think we handled the pandemic pretty gracefully. I do. I do think we handled the pandemic well. I do think we did. I know. I know. All right, each other's throats, and it feels like we're in a way worse place, and in a lot of ways we are. But there were nine billion people on the planet. What the fuck do we think was going to happen? I think that we handled it pretty damn well, despite how we feel about each other. I think Republicans saved some of the economy. I think Democrats saved some of the grandparents, and all it took was a sincere, profound resentment for each other as human beings. I think Democrats saved some of the grandparents, and all it took was a sincere, profound resentment for each other as human beings. masks really through people for a loop. they didn't like that. I get that. math. breath is not nice. breath is not age well. breath is not age well. There's a reason they don't make breath-centred candles. but a plague was coming. a plague was always coming. It's the one thing that science and the Bible agreed on. I don't think everybody should have had to live the same. I drove across country last year. There's just so many different... There's nobody in Kansas. Is anybody here from Kansas? There it is. Yeah, they're here. Thank you for coming. Is it Tuiya? Are you both senators? I think Kansas is a scam. I think Kansas is a scam. There's a lot of windmills. I think Kansas is two senators, an unlimited electricity. And I just don't think... There's a lot of places in the country like that. If you live out there, if you live in New York, yeah, where it has, Matt, suit. If you live in rural Kansas, I don't think you should have to wear pants. I also don't think you should have high-speed internet access. Because you don't have enough... That's what my family's doing. You don't have enough people to bounce your ghost stories off of. People are seeing... People are in a situation where they're seeing more people on their screens than in real life. And that's a problem. Because then you don't have anybody to bounce these ghost stories that you're getting blown up your asshole from the other side of the planet on. And you got people in fucking baby-huffing dungeons. Most people are just trying to go to the grocery store. You got people on baby-huffing. You're believing... That's where I lose. You lose me on a conspiracy shit. That heavy... That heavy... That dank... Conspiracy shit. You know... Like, you know... I don't know. It's the microchip. There's microchips in the back. Really? Mandy, how many? One? Multiple? How's benefit analysis on this? How much is Bill Gates investing in mapping the route from your duplex to the strip mall nearest your duplex? Angry. I can take angry and I can take dumb. I can't... I can't take dumb and angry. Because the odds are you're angry because you're dumb. Alright! Wow! And I might speak from experience, but I don't know. If your boogie man had a Ph.D. Well then, maybe you're a little bit dumb to be this angry. I don't know, it's weird. It's weird. It's appropriate though. It's the American way. You know, what's the worst thing we could possibly put in our bodies? was the dumbest thing I could cram into my head right now. It's like food. It's like food. Q&A is just what happened when pizza restaurants started making cinnamon rolls. And, is the screens went up our goal fish ball. I get clickbait and just dumb shit online. I fall for it all the time. It's like my wife, Glamping. That's some internet nonsense right there. That is some screen-based nonsense right there. If you don't know, it's glamorous camping. It doesn't exist. There's no such thing. It's for people that hate camping and are easily fooled by the internet. What they do is they put a tarp over some wine glasses. They put pictures on Instagram. They charge $2.45 a night. You pay it and then you're an asshole for the rest of your life. And it's a cost. Here's some dumb clickbait I fell for. Submarine that turns into a yacht. Show it to me. It was just an ugly boat. It was just an ugly boat. It was just a decommissioned submarine that put a spoiler on it. That was it. It was pretty sad actually. It was greatness of a submarine. Used to do science and fight wars. Now it's getting puke done by Kelly's bachelor at party. I think he used to make movies with Jacoosto. Oh, it's got rims on it. Don't even go underwater anymore. It can't even flex its scientific muscles. That's a fancy part of submarine. We never turn into a yacht. We never stoop so low as to turn into a yacht. What do you mean? Who needs science? We got money. A butterfly doesn't turn back into a caterpillar. That glam trip made me identify with those dudes at Storm the Capitol though. That was just their glam trip. That was just their glam trip. They just wanted to go away for the weekend and pretend to do some shit they weren't doing. They just wanted to see a democracy that turned into a yacht. You know what bothered me the most about January 6th? The merch. Why is there merch? Are you guys wearing matching hooded sweatshirts? Who's selling merch at the revolution? Abraham Lincoln didn't sell top hats. What's... Do we just lose World War III to a Bartlett softball team? People are these absentee dads on Instagram live spending their child support money on merch. You got merch money. How bad am I supposed to feel? You got merch money. You're smashing up the Capitol so that your fire guy can keep his job. Who am I supposed to feel bad for here? The your fire guy. Did you imagine the slave mentality of lifting a fucking finger for the your fire guy? I for one cannot. Wild. Unreal unnecessary white trash block party that one right there. How many golf pros do you think Storm the Capitol? Not pro golfers, just guys running driving ranges somewhere. It's a serious question. Any gamblers in here want to set the line for me? Over under. Over under. 12 is way high. 12 is way high. 12 is I'm going under 12. Five. Five is a better number. Four and a half or five and a half. Three and a half. I'll let you change. It's okay. You can change your answer. You can change your answer. I like it. Back in Tagitalla, ready you and me were both bad gamblers. I would go over that, but try not. But you know there was one. I'm just saying there was one. Todd. He was on his screens too much. Whipped up on his screens. Too much time on his phone. Spent Todd. Too much time on his phone on the range was Todd. Well, they did it again. They did it again. He threw it down his sandwich. He folded up his collar shirts, put him in his leather travel bag, and went with his initials on it. And through that, he's escalated. The one his dad leases for him. For the first time in 35 years, Todd left myrtle beach. And he got to DC, and he laid eyes on DC, and he checked into the Marriott. And he got a good night's rest, and then he woke up and he saw they had an omelette bar. So he got the fucking omelette bar. Todd likes eggs. Todd likes real eggs. He put some cheddar cheese and jalapenos on there. Thank you very much. The new last day, Todd gets eggs. They're trying to take Todd's eggs away. And he got a good meal in his belly, and then he skipped off to the revolution. We're in Metis CrossFit coach, and they slammed a cops head in the door. And Bear Spray, a congressional page, and their new QAnon hood of sweatshirts. And didn't wear a mask. The one time he should have wore a mask. Todd. Todd. Todd. Todd. Now the FBI got to go to the driving range, Todd. Now they got to come to your range, Todd. I don't know. Vladimir Putin said, it's easier to fool a man than it is to convince a man he's been fooled. Vladimir Putin did not say that. Mark Twain said that. But I say that Vladimir Putin said it so that the people that need to hear it will listen. It's just, I think oftentimes we're just at the mercy of deteriorating men. I've always wanted to be a grandpa. I really don't have no interest in being a parent. I want to be a parent for like five hours a week. The rest of it looks like y'all got ripped off. The rest of it looks like a really bad deal. But I had something that I had something. I had something changed about that recently. I got a silver alert. It's an amber alert for an elderly person. Did they got him in Illinois? Okay. Right. So that's... I lost the grandpa to dementia. It's not a laughing matter. But he was doing wild shit at the end. And I thought, you know, it makes me... I'd be lucky to get to that point. And by the time I do, I'm probably going to be in a lot of pain. I'm going to be lucky to not have metal in every joint. And an organ that I want to chuck into the lake. And if I get to that point, and the brain that's reminding me how much pain I'm in every day of my life, decides to shut the fuck up, and my body gets to take a victory lap for an afternoon. And the children that I raised to completion think that it's acceptable to knock me out to the fire department. You're not dead to me, but... Shit's different now. When I can remember what you did, things are going to be different now. I mean, just take my car keys away. Don't do that. How about this? My brain shut down. I'm not on the loose. Like, did you even look? Go get your shithead cousins and a rope and a flashlight. And go walk around the neighborhood. Give me back on the patio before you start texting three counties, my all my information. Everybody I ever knew, thinks I'm out there in my PJs, running into a curb like a glitch in a video game. Go get your cousins and my grandkids. You know what? Haven't bring the birthday checks back, because I'm trying to repossess some shit. I wrote them checks in the amount of the age they were turning. It was adorable. I was super grandpa. All you had to do was get me beer and play cards with me. And this is what I get? You're out of the will, but I want you to come to the reading, because I've hired a professional wrestler to read it to you. And tell you that you don't get my cars, and I'm leaving the house to the stripper you don't know exists. That was what my grandpa was doing. He was trying to fuck a meth head stripper in Kentucky. He was driving across state lines. That's what he thought he was doing. I mean, I don't know what he did. Well, when he was leaving, he was going to fuck a meth head stripper. That's the, that's the, it started good. And then when he got there, he wrapped his car around a tree. And that's when things went bad. It's all right. And that just terrifies me. I just don't want the last thing on my body that works to be my nuts. Take my car keys, take my nuts. If I get to that point, take my balls. I'm serious. I'm honestly about to advocate for adult male castration. I am. I'm done with my nuts now. A third of the men I've ever known could handle their balls. They're ruining a perfect and good gender. Ladies, if you know any man that's functional, he's working very hard to overcome his nuts. We are walking around shit faced on our own balls all the time. Nuts are a Ferrari engine and most men are just a Honda Accord. And we are burning through tires. Our whole lives. Our whole lives. We didn't, we didn't. We didn't use the care about nuts like this. As a species we did. That's one thing that I learned from the Catholic Church. They used to cut little boys' balls off so they could hit a high note and choir. Yeah, that's real. I don't look at, I didn't do this shit. They were called castratos. That's what I'm saying. That's where nuts used to rank. Just below Christmas carols in Latin. Right here. What percentage of your bad decisions would you blame on your nuts? Hold up now. I'm giving you a chance to excuse a lot of bad behavior. 40% that's solo. That is solo. That is either you just didn't think that through or you got skeletons in your closet that you're trying to pretend aren't there. I mean, I am way up there. Well, fine. Okay, fine, 40%. Now imagine if you weren't there to stop them. You'd be up there. You'd be way up there. Right? Yeah, I don't want that. I'm not, please. I don't know. I think it's a rough situation for men when they get to that age. And then that's the only age when we finally trust them to put them in positions of power. This is why we have two types of leaders. That's why we only have two kinds of leaders. What the fuck is wrong with him? And is he okay? That's it. That's all that's left. And Vlad and his Putin is what the fuck is wrong with him. That's perfect example. He's just an old man's balls playing games with younger men's balls. Just putting younger men's balls against each other. It's a time-honored human tradition. That's just because, I mean, his nuts are servant drinks. Our brains turn to mush. Our joints he jacked and our balls are down there serving drinks the whole time. Vladimir Putin's balls are the bartender from the shining. Take my nuts. Second, I get a home depot credit card. I'm getting it. I don't want to make some of these horrific mistakes. That's the real pen. Forget QAnon. Leapblowers is the real pandemic in this country. Sometimes I do this bit and I see old dudes face kind of change. I like my leafblower. Fuck that shit, dude. Get a rake. Barry that in the backyard. We're not going to say anything about it. We're going to pretend like it never happened. That glam trip was fine. That was a beautiful vacation. We were on my wife's family reunion. It was actually awesome. It was ruined by a leafblower at 8 a.m. on Sunday morning. I was in my lean-to. I had my tarp. It was me, my tarp, leafblower. Just... Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Hell no. 245 a night. What? Absolute... In my mind, this is some asshole that travels with his leafblower. My first assumption that it was not somebody from the campsite. Hotels don't vacuum before checkout. I thought this was some guy. Because I'm ready for you people to start carrying those things in holsters. Like people... Like I thought it was just some asshole in a way in a bago that could not bear the thought of being a part of his leafblower for three days. And he was like, oh I'm going to be in the woods. Imagine all the things I can blow around in the woods. And I kicked my tarp open. I kicked my tarp open my underwear. I was looking for faces. And sure enough, it's a dude from the campsite. Collared shirt, logo and everything. I was the asshole, y'all and employees. I was like, yo, it's 8 a.m. guy. He takes his finger off the gas for a second. He's greased up hillbilly. I swear to God. Looks like he's dead in the face. God, I still got to work though. That's what he said to me. It's going to bounce off the back of my skull for the rest of my life. I still got to work though. I instantly stopped carrying about the leafblower. I was instantly distracted by this blue collar cosplay. He had typed up for himself. I swear he was somehow at work right now. It was a huge roll of golf cart with a leafblower. With an outdoor blow dryer to point it at some gravel patches. He drove to work. Got in a golf cart. Brought a blow dryer. I still got to work though. Fuck you buddy. I wasn't raised in a coal mine, okay? But I've roofed houses and painted houses and bail hay. And I was Mr. Miyagi enough to know that taking one button to the next button to the next button does not make you the backbone of the American economy guy. You are not a dock worker friend. Turn that shit down. You are ruining my lamp trip. Buttons. Thanks Buttons. Take a couple hours off. Go have some more red bull. What are you doing? I hope you don't get a kid at home playing Fortnite that you'd be rate for not popping out of bed every morning. So go move leaves around in the woods. It's everywhere. It's coast to coast. I live in LA. Ah, it's California. There's no leaves. There's no leaves. It's just dust. It's just dust. You're just whipping up the dust. You're just whipping up the dust in the air. Why? Why? Wow big is your lawn. You better have a football field to justify that thing. To justify weaponizing what used to be the ground. You're getting in your eyes. It's in my eyes and mouth and throat. You shut down my block for four hours with your fucking leaf floor. What are you doing? And where does the dust settle? Cars. All your cars. Now all your neighbors have to go get car washes because you had to have it. There could be ranges. Ranges. Away from our cars. Leaf-blower ranges. I'm standing by those. Leaf-blower ranges where cooked up step-dads can go. Micro-managed, small patches of cement for 15, 20, 30 minutes at a time. Just to blow off some steam. Whatever fixes it. I want your patch to be clean, guys. But otherwise, leaf-blower should cost $10,000. And $9,500 of that should go into a federal fund to pay for all your neighbors car washes past present future. I stand by that. All right. I'll get out of here. No, there is. I saw one guy in Kansas. It was the cop that let me out of a speeding ticket with a joke. I like that guy. I was smoking weed, I was in Kansas. I was just trying to get through Kansas. I don't care if it's legal. It's legal where I live. It's legal. I don't have. And I'm trying to figure out who don't have it figured out yet. It's, yes. I can't keep track of what states are still run by dorks from the 50s. And I wasn't even planning on my feet touching the ground in Kansas. So I was smoking weed, I was moving. A little bit later, I'll see the lights on. Damn. Okay. Pull over. Dude, we'll ox up. Real tense. Kind of cop. It seemed like he might fire tear gas to cover a fire. He comes in hot. Is that what you such a hurried for, California? I'm a stand up community. I got to get to Iowa tomorrow. I have a show in Iowa. So I had you going 81 to 65? Yeah, buddy. It's Kansas. That's about the bare minimum. I'm going to be going in Kansas. You want me to stop and check out the library guy? I'm going to need to see your license and registration. He's right here. He snatches it. Goes back to his car 20 minutes later. He comes back still hot. So I'm going to need to hear a joke. I didn't like that part. She asked me to give me the ticket. Don't make me dance. You got a hard job. I got a hard job. I'm going to make me dance. You know, I mean, he knew I didn't have my tools. This is the thing. There's the things. This thing. You're very nice. You guys are very nice. You're very nice. But if I followed you back to your hotel tonight, I tried to tell you about the Herpes vaccine. You got to get some frantic on the property right now. I want to come get this guy too sweet. But I didn't want the ticket. So I said, OK. Why did the squirrel crawl into my dickhole? His tone changed. I peaked his interest. He said, I don't know man why. I said, he was trying to get to my nuts. Well, he liked that joke more than you guys did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I like that guy. I think about that guy. I appreciated him. I felt like we grew together. I think about him. I worry about him. Because I know he's out there telling my joke. You can't force comedy. Takes a long time. I know he's out there just butchering my joke. For the god knows who Bobby, 81 and 65, California, plates. We give tickets to those. I don't see any kind of citation here or anything. He heard it. I don't give a shit, Bobby. I'm going to need to see some sort of documentation, some sort of explanation, report on my desk and today. Chief, I'm going to do it for you live. No thanks, Bobby. You got the right to remain silent. Chief, why would? How come? Why would? Why would? A squirrel, a wild squirrel. Chief, teeth and claws and shit. Kind of set not your normal squirrel that you would not be intimidated by. For the sake of this hypothetical, you on your toes. He could do some damage to you, Chief. And he wants something from you. Something from inside you. Something that you care about. And he wants it bad. Something that a squirrel regularly wants. What would he want? That you got? What would you, a squirrel, with teeth and claws and shit? I know domesticated raccoon keep on her in my porch. I'm talking about a wild animal that's got a spring in his step and coming at you. Fast and yeaming it will move for a long time. I know him for 35 years, Chief. You have slow some bitch. And he's coming for you. And he's going to get something from you, Chief. What's he want? He wants your nuts. Squirrels won't nuts. Squirrels won't nuts. Chief, Chief, he wants your damn nuts. How's he going to get there, Dickhole? Squirrel coming in your dickhole, Chief. Bobby, I'm going to need your gun and belt. I'm going to need your gun and badge. You guys have been fantastic. Thank you so much for being here, everybody. Thank you to the Green Mill. Thank you, Chicago. I love you. Thank you. Here's everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

 Guys, I'm telling you, this is it. This is, I've tried everything, okay? This is my shining moment as a father for you. I've tried wrapping up a pancake like a burrito with syrup on it, but that gets way too messy. I've tried taking a bite of a pancake, then just pouring syrup into my mouth to get that right ratio. That has not worked. What I have found works the best is you cut the center out of the pancake, right? You remove the center, then you pour syrup into the center. So that's going to soak up that syrup right in the middle, and that's going to be the best part of the pancake. Plus, what you've done without even knowing it is you've saved a dad in the middle of the pancake. That's the greatest bite-ad pancake history. Dad, don't you have to go to a show. Figure out the tip. Who's going to do it? I got it. I got it. Because I know for every $10, you leave a $2 bill. So this is $30, so that's $3, $2 bills. That's six money. That's perfect, man. That's actually a great way to think about it. Way to go. Yeah, don't forget your passport. All right, we got to move. Let's go. Ladies and gentlemen, Chad Daniel. Hi, everyone. Hello. Hi. I'm glad you're here. This is going to be OK. I want you to know that I know that I don't look like you thought I would. Take it in. I realize that. My kids remind me that I've gotten older every day. Kamma, every day. I dropped my son off one time and he goes, God, you've aged like a president. And then my daughter goes, I was thinking guacamole. So they're pretty cool, right? Yeah, great. I grew a beard. That can make a guy look older. But I grew a beard for two reasons. Number one, beards are like sweatpants for your face. Doesn't matter how chubby you're getting when you're wearing one. Man, I grew a beard for a whole year. And then shaved it to the skin. What an asshole. Who does that? I mean, just in one thing. I looked in the mirror and I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It was crazy. What was I doing? Just sat in my bathroom all night going, ah, trying to push hair out of my face. But that's just how you hurt your back. The other reason I grew a beard is because my 18 year old son challenged me to a beard growing contest. And he lost because he is 18. You ever seen an 18 year old's beard? Oh my god, they're so gross. It's like a daddy long leg. He's just crawling out feet first. Like a whisker up here and a whisker over here. I have a grandmother that could beat this kid in a beard growing contest. Use an only moles. I think my son challenged me to a beard growing contest because pubic hair grew in on other parts of his body and that grew in full. Does that is how pubic hair works? Nobody has patchy pubes. Let me rephrase that. I don't think anybody has patchy pubes. Some of you shut down on that one. You're like, hey, buddy, right here. What are you doing out of the house? Just stay home and fix your dick manger, whatever. It's probably not called that, but that's what I'm going to call it. I have never seen pubic hair on my son's body, but I have for sure seen it shaved off of his body onto my toilet seat. You know where my toilet seat is? That's in my bathroom. That's an easy one. Everyone should have got that. Do you know where my bathroom is? That is in my bedroom. So that means he walked through my bedroom and he is not allowed in there because clothes go missing and pillows get moved. And I don't trust that. A crooked pillow is a mystery. I don't want us off. So that goes in the garbage immediately. I just picture him straddling my toilet. And I know he straddled it because there are only pubes on the back half of the toilet seat. If you have a better theory, I'll listen, but there isn't one. That's the only way because I know he wasn't using painter's tape and shit to straighten it out. Hold on, it's not even yet. Let me get a laser level. I got it. Just over my toilet. Fee-oh, fee-oh, fee-oh. Like he's making a pair of ugboots. Walking out of my bathroom like, fuck it, my dad will clean it up. I'm 18, I don't try. You know, whatever kids say when you're not around. The main problem I have with these pubes on the toilet is that during this story, my kids live with me Sunday to Wednesday. They live with their mother Wednesday to Sunday. And he shaved his pubes Wednesday before he went to school. That means he was not going to be home for four days. So I called the cell phone when he was at school to leave a message, but he answered because he is not a good student. And I said, hey man, found some pubes. And he said, where? Which leads me to believe. I have not found all the pubes. What do you mean where? Why are there options to this conversation? Am I going to happen upon more pubes later this afternoon? Boy, I sure hope not, because I taught him not a prank and I know he's real good at it. I haven't checked, but I bet you there are pubes in my sleeping bag right now. That's a hard-ass burn. Many naps on their camping. The first time you get in that bag, the food is in the tree and the fire is out and you're like, oh, I can't wait to get some. Those are pubes. You got me. So I said, hey man, why did you shave the pubes at my house? And he goes, because mom is not there to yell at me. And I said, that is the dumbest answer I've ever heard. So get back here after school and clean these up. And he said, I'm sorry, father, but according to the custody agreement, I'm at mother's now. And I know that was meant to make me mad, but it didn't. I was thrilled he used two three syllable words in one sentence. Because I have watched him walk into a wall during the daytime. Natural sunlight guiding his way and just still, funk. So I waited till Sunday and he came to my house and said, hey man, come give me a hug. And he came to give me a hug like this. And when he did, I spun him around and I put him in a full Nelson. And I walked him up the stairs and I walked him into my bathroom. And I bent him over the toilet like I was rubbing a dog's nose in its own shit. Because the pubes were still there. They're not mine. I'm not cleaning those off. I walked downstairs in my own home for four straight days to use the bathroom because I am committed to parenting. So I haven't bent over the toilet and he starts making the weirdest noise. He started going like that. And I panicked a little bit because when he was two, he had asthma. When he was seven, it went away because of a nebulizer. And I thought, oh my god, did I give my kid back asthma? But I didn't. Turns out he was just blow and pubed dust. To create a clean breathing area. Once I figured that out, I could not stop laughing. Because I had come to the realization, my son is pubic care waterboarding himself. And that hits the spot. I was laughing so hard. My grip loosened. He finally wiggles around and he goes, why are you doing this to me? Because your mom's not here to yell at me anymore either. Thank you. I used to have a story about when my son turned 18, I was going to punch him in the face. He's 18 now. On his birthday, I got up early. I set my alarm. And he went downstairs and made myself a good breakfast. And then I heard him getting up. And I go, here we go. It's game time. My heart started racing. My hands got sweaty. Mom spaghettie. So dumb. Oh god. I started giving myself a pep talk. I was like, you can punch him. He's 18. You can do this. Because you did not spank him. And these are all the spankings. That he should have coming to him. And then I heard him coming down the stairs. So I started walking towards the bottom of the staircase. I turned the corner and I just saw a little boy walking towards me. And I was like, you can't punch this little boy. But here's what you can do. You can put a hockey helmet on him and hockey gloves. And then you can put those on as well. And we can go in the backyard and we can lock your box. So that's what we did. And I kept hitting him in the shoulder. And he goes, it doesn't even hurt. What are you doing? And I was like, all right, just wait. And then the third round, he could not lift his hands up to protect his face. That's old man knowledge. President style. After we lock our box, I went inside and I checked my social media. And there were over a thousand messages asking if I had punched my son in the face. Happy birthday. That's kind of world we live in, I guess. So I replied to all these messages. I said, no, I couldn't punch him in the face. I didn't think it'd be fair to him. So instead we went in the backyard and we lock our box. And then I put my phone away. And then 24 hours later, I checked and I got a message from a man in Little Rock, Arkansas. And he had replied back to me with a picture of urban dictionaries definition of locker box. And I would like to tell you, it is not what I thought. Urban dictionaries definition of locker box is when you're having sex with someone, you also shove your nuts into them. I mean, where do you even start? Do people do that? And it's so how? How do you do that? The only thing I know about that sexual position is you probably need the lights on. That does not seem like a feel around job to finish it. So anyways, I sent over 1000 people a message from my home computer that said, no, man, I didn't punch him in the face. You know, because that wouldn't be fair. Instead, I brought him in the backyard and I put my balls up there. And I was nervous that the green light on my computer was going to come on on the camera. And it would just be the feds like, what else is going on over there? My son no longer lives with me. Not because a locker box or whatever. He went to one semester at college and didn't like it. That's fair for me. But he also didn't want to get a job. And that's where I drew the line because I just can't. So let him go through the holidays. We did all that stuff, hung out a lot. And then January 1st, I said, you owe me $400 rent. And then if you don't have a job by February 1st, I'm going to kick you out. If you do have a job by February 1st, I'm going to give you 200 of that 400 back. And we're going to call that a happy father rebate. And then if you have a job, the first of every month, you're going to pay me $200 rent for the rest of time until I kick you out permanently. And he goes, 200. What about 150 and I buy my own milk? Who in the fuck drinks $50 worth of milk in a year? Are you having bone problems? What's going on? It's probably why I can't find a job. He's a horrible negotiating. We'll give you $17 an hour. What about 16 and I'll drive myself here? Well, you would be expected 14. Okay, we're no longer hiring. The first month my son left, my electric bill went down $80. That's a lot. Want to know why? Because his hobby is leaving my lights on. It's like a passion project for him. He wears a fit bit around his wrists and I bet he gets 10,000 steps a day. Just turn him a goddamn lights on. All around the house. That's a lot of green. I know all my lights are on at all times because I live in a place where a lot of people like to hunt. My friends will get up early at 4 in the morning and they'll drive out to hunt and they'll go by my house and then they'll call me and say, hey, are you home? I go, no, why? Well, because all your lights are on. Well, which ones? Yeah, all of them. Ports to garage, buddy. Ports to garage. And you want to know why they're on? Because my son's scared when he's there by himself. That's the only logical reason. He's tough. I mean, he wanted to live there, right? He doesn't live with me full time at that point. You know, because he loves me more than his mom, no. Because he's long at the freedom when I was on the road working. I'm tough. I'm gonna live with my dad's house. And when he's gone, it's gonna be my house. Because I'm tough. Until the wind blows a tree and the branch scratches the house. Bane, bane, bane, bane, bane, bane. Just a step, brrrrrrrrr. Operation sunshine. You can still run it into walls. I also have a 14 year old daughter and I gave her a chore list with three words on it and she goes, where's your chore list? You ever had a kid say something to you that they're serious but then you almost ruin it because you laugh? That's what I was like, oh girl, what? And I just go, what did you say? And she goes, where's your... She slowed it down. Like I didn't... Like I actually didn't hear her, you know? So I said, you know everything that happens in this house to make this home operate? Subtract the three things I asked you to do and that is my chore list. Remember when you woke up in a bed warm and not hungry? Fuckin' check! Check! Check! I did that shit. So my chore list also has three words on it and it says, keep her alive. And it expires in four years. So focused. She's 14 now. She was 12. I started listening to podcasts about periods. And I know that seems creepy. I'm positive I'm on a list somewhere. But I never wanted to be the dad that had to send her to her mom to ask her all those questions. I don't want you to know like, that's a question for your mom. You know where to find me if you want to play catch. I mean it's ridiculous, right? So I was listening to these podcasts but I had to stop because one of them kind of creeped me out. And it said, if you're going to show your daughter how to use a tampon you push it into your hand and then so I was like, well yeah, my hand's been a vagina. Okay, that makes sense. Sure. If you're looking for a number you're not going to get it. Just know that it has been. But then I pictured myself pushing a tampon into my hand and oh my god, it just looks like a magic trick. Doesn't it not? Just like, hey, whoo. Where's the tampon? You better find it because toxic shock is real. My daughter got her period in my house for the first time and she came down stairs and she goes, dad, two things. Number one, got my period. Number two, don't want to talk about it. And I was like, number one, great. Number two, greater. And she said, I have to go to mom's house because she bought me some stuff. And I said, I don't know if you've heard about the new legislation that was just passed but dads are now allowed to buy things. They're letting us out of the house. So I said, come upstairs. I mean, we went upstairs and I opened the closet next to the laundry room and in there was one box of all of the each. I had all the kinds, all every box that they make. Or at least they were at the store because I got there and I was like, oh, that's different. All right, oh, that's different too. And I got all of them. And that cost $217 where I met. And I said, whatever you need for this is going to be in here because that is every kind. They don't make any more than that. If you need something that isn't in there, sorry about your square vagina. And in that case, we are going to have to call your mom because she's way better at making appointments. And then she just goes, God, you're so dumb. And she grabbed a box and goes, it's right here. I know what I need. And then she left. I don't have anything to do. So I brought back $211 worth of tampons. That is an interesting exchange. There were so many boxes left and you can't carry them in because they're all individual boxes. So I had to walk in the target, get an empty cart and just walk out with an empty cart. And people were like, is this bitch stealing a cart? What is going on? So then I loaded it up with all the tampons and I brought it back in and I brought it up to the exchange counter and the guy goes, you checking out? And I go, hmm, checking in. And he looked at my cart and he looked at me and he just goes, I mean, what happened? That is a reasonable question. But I didn't know I was going to get asked. So I panicked and I just went, she said, pancake mix. If we could get this done, everybody's real hungry at the house. In my opinion, it is harder raising a 14 year old daughter and an 18 year old son than when they were little. Because when they were little, I could give them all the same rules. I could sit them down in the couch and say, hey, don't break anything. Don't drink my chocolate milk and go outside until it is dark. And they would go, all right, dad, that was it. But now I can't do that. I have to give them individual rules and it takes longer and I don't like it. I don't think, I also don't think it is fair. I have to tell my daughter, you are going to a party. We will keep your water bottle close to you and keep the cap on. If you are going to play hide and seek, please don't run into the woods with four boys even if they are your friends. Because people could start talking and then that is not going to be great. I don't have to tell that to my son, hey, if you are going to a party, please don't run into the woods with four girls because people could start talking and then they are going to think you are awesome. That is a really weird double standard that I don't like. I tell my daughter a ton of stuff when she leaves the house. You know what I tell my son? Drive safe, don't rape. That is it. That is it. That is every single thing I want him to know. Some of you might be like, you can't say rape, Chad. Well, you sure can if you say don't in front of it. Yeah. That is like the number one time they want you saying it. I am pretty sure. One time a guy after a show, honestly asked me, he goes, why would you tell your son, drive safe, don't rape? And I just was like, I really did think that was self-explanatory. But if you are looking for an answer, here it is. I want him to arrive safely and then when he does, to not rape anyone. I don't think he is going to but it doesn't hurt to remind people of big things. Drive safe, don't rape. That is four words. They are all one syllable. Sounds like a caveman. Drive safe, don't rape. And that works well for 18 year old boys because they are cavemen. Drive safe, don't rape. Me! Yeah, you buddy. You for sure, but everybody, everybody. Hintu! Hintu and me, just like Durant. There you go. Oh, damn. Okay, Dad. I got it. Fire good. Yeah, fire is good. Fire good rape, Dad. Isaac, smart. Isaac, smart. I'm going to start saying that everywhere I go. I mean, not like a caveman because that would creep people out, of course. You can't walk down the street. Just like Durant. Everybody would be like, oh, he lost his shaperone. I think it's a good message. I think guys should say it to guys all the time. I don't think there's any harm in it. Plus, you're going to learn a lot about someone that you say it to. Here's your change. Have a great day. Thank you so much. Don't rape. Why would you say don't rape to me? If that ever happens to you, you are face to face with a rapist. Because why else would you freak out that much? I thought about it. If I was walking down the street and somebody goes, hey man, don't rape. I'd be like, oh my god, I was just thinking that. Thank you. You too. I've also told my son that if he's on a date, and it's not going well, it doesn't want a second date, but the girl wants to kiss him at the end of that date, we'll just don't. Because that's going to be a real awkward situation later on. It's going to be awkward for sure in those five minutes. But that's okay. That's five minutes. You don't want to have that shit go on forever. And if you don't believe me, why don't you call Aziz, see what he thinks about it. That come out of the mic wrong? What happened? Aziz got in trouble for having a bad date. He's a famous comedian for those who don't know. There was a girl that he went on a date with, and he wanted to have sex with that girl, and she wanted a famous boyfriend, and neither of that worked. There is so much dumb on both sides of this story, it is mind-blowing to me. For those of you that never read the article, here's what happened. They got home from dinner, she sat on his kitchen counter, and then they both agreed that he was going to put his this part on her this part. Immediately when they got home. It's like a kid hitting a ball at Little League and running right to third. I mean, yeah, it's adorable, but there are rules here. Then they both agreed that she was going to put her this part on his this part two times. Gentlemen, I think we can all agree that no means no every single time. But what about, uh-huh, even then for sure. But then ladies, you also have to agree that no one can hear you saying no when you voluntarily put their dick in your mouth two times. In the article, she was quoted as saying he wasn't getting my non-verbal cues. Well, where I'm from, sucking a dick is not a good one. I'm not having any fun, gah, gah. I mean, that is not how you call Uber. Everybody knows that. Everyone knows. It's an app. The reason I bring this up is because I think sometimes we shift the spotlight from where it needs to be, right? My daughter's 14. I'd like to have this shit figured out in four years. We do. We shift it. The Me Too movement is super serious. Have you read some of the stories? They're gut-wrenching and heartbreaking. And then there are some where it's just like, all right, there was a lady from Michigan who got her a scrap by President Bush senior 27 years ago. And that was her Me Too story. And like, you read the other ones and you're like, how are you limping in with this bullshit? He didn't finger your ass hole. And I want to be very, very clear about something. In no way am I blaming this woman. But I feel like all of us learn at a very young age to not stand in front of an old man for any reason at all. They are the grossest things, not people, things on the whole planet. It goes old men, monkeys, seaweed. Those are the top three grossest things on the whole planet Earth. Monkeys throw shit at you. Yeah, that's an easy number two. I got it. Seaweed. Messes with you when you're swimming. You don't know what it is. You can't see underwater. Old men do both of those things. An old man will throw shit up into the air so you look at it just so he can give you a wet willy. They're the creepiest things ever. Have you ever swam with an old man? It's always just like, bad at bad at bad at bad at. Like they're tits floating on top of the water. Like an oil spill. Like when you make a pancake, you know I'm talking how it spreads out. Just bad at bad. I'd rather get eaten by a shark at that point. That's weird. Now some people may think, Chad, you just think this way because you're a man. Well, that has to be part of it. My brain has been connected to a dick for quite a while. But I believe that all of our lenses are tinted from several different things. I was also raised by a very strong single mother. And so I watched her operate in different situations. And that's what I learned. If my mom would have got her ascribed by anyone, doesn't matter if it's a president, she wouldn't have went away for 27 years. She would have done one of two things immediately. She would have had a churned around and said, do it again and then break your hand. Or she would have just yelled, this piece of shit just scrapped my ass. And yeah. I don't know if you know this, but that's how you end the picnic. And my sister and I would have been just cowering in the car like, oh man, we should clean the house a week at home. You know, because she's pretty mad. Did you see what happened? I didn't even see it, but there was an old guy as a pride him. I live in the same small town where I grew up and nobody likes me from a long time ago. And I know that sounds sad, but it's pretty freeing. Like, and say whatever I want, and I'm not going to lose friends. I'm there. I was at a small cafe and a woman was reading the article about the lady for Michigan. And she said, can you believe this? And I said that they would waste that much ink on that? No, I can't. And then everyone turned their chair to look at both of us. Like we were going to lock her box or something. And she said, I will have you know, a female American president would never grab an ass. And I said, well, neither would a unicorn because neither of them exists. You can get as mad as you want, but you can't do an experiment with a group that doesn't have any fucking people in it. I thought she had it locked. She wears pantsuits on purpose. What a great presidential candidate. But 45% of people that look just like her said, maybe next time. You want to know why? Because women don't get along. And I know there's this movement. Yes, we do, but you don't. You're at the movement with a picket sign and you have the same one. You're like, oh, fuck this. I mean, it's... And that's sad to me because you're easily the better of the two sexes. You should own everything, but you're busy bickering your way to second place. It's crazy then. A man could punch a man in the face and have a beer with that save man five minutes later. A lady could hear some shit. She maybe thought was about her and hate that bitch till she dies. It's crazy, you guys. Why? Are you doing that? Here's my theory. I feel like you don't get along because you've been pitt against one another since you were little kids. You're going to school, oh, you better get all cute and get pittails so you can find a boy. You don't want to be an old maid, right? That's crazy that you had to listen to that shit. How is the human species, the only species where women have to look nice? Have you seen nature? Have you seen a beautiful peacock? That's a dude. That's a dude peacock. Just, ah, look what I got. Have you ever seen a female peacock? Fucking gross. They're like, they're gray. They're gray and just sloppy. But they have a vagina. So they win, the whole thing. Women, you should not ever have to put on makeup. You should be able to walk into a bar and just go, I'll be in the car. It's bunkers. I also think it would be nice if we could all have the same rules. Let's make a big rule book that everybody agrees on. I think being an individual is amazing and what makes the planet great. However, everyone has their own rules and you can't get to know someone in a day for all their rules. So I have a friend on Facebook and she posted, am I ever going to be able to go to a bar by myself and not have a man ask if I'm okay? And no, is the answer. And that sucks, but it worked once. I don't know when, let's say the 40s. There was a lady drinking a drink all by herself in the bar and a man walked in and he goes, are you okay? And then they had sex and he told everyone he'd ever met. And that story's been passed down from generation to generation. Little boys are walking home from their grandfather's homes like, ask if she's okay. Ask if she's okay. Because we're simple creatures. We go with what works. And seventh grade, a teacher told me I look nice and sweaters. Here we are. Here we are. Now, somebody will like me again. That's good. Welcome back. Welcome back. I try to stay out of the rest of the politics because it's too demanding. And I like to sleep. Hey Chad, did you hear about, no I didn't, good night. It's like my new move. I do think politics divides us and makes us softer because I mean people are so fake taken aback when it comes to every opinion. They're like, I don't want my friend to think that I think this and they don't think that. And then we've been going, I'm surprised we haven't changed our national anthem to. I know we're getting soft as a country because one time I heard a guy go, if I could just be half the man my father was, well you are, that's how genetics works. You also have to woman your mom was and you're acting like her right now so get your shit together. And I'll tell you this, I don't even like that joke. I just like to watch some of the women laugh and some of the women not laugh because it proves you don't get along. It's crazy. It's right just set it and you're back on track already. All right. I think we're getting softer as a country people say sorry all the time when they don't need to. Right. You ever been bumped into and somebody goes, oh sorry. Yeah? For what? You just barely bumped into me. Have you been planning this for two weeks? Because then an apology is necessary. But this seems like an excuse me moment. Right? Like what are you going to say when someone important to me dies? Right. Like, oh I'm so sorry. Same way like when you bumped into me. I went to Starbucks and once I go, hey man are you in line? I go, yeah I am sorry. Yeah for what? Getting here faster? So I stood right in front of him. And he goes, hey man I am in line and go, yeah but you're sorry. So I'm just trying to help with the guilt. My daughter says sorry nonstop. My daughter will say sorry three times for the same thing. And now you're just being an asshole. Sorry once. You can't keep doing it and think sorry is going to get you off the hook. So I have a swear jar in my house that costs you a quarter. I have a sorry jar that will cost you a dollar. What's the lesson there? Call your dad a piece of shit. Just don't apologize for it. Because that is a 400% markup. My home is also filled with hyperbole because of my daughter. Everything is the best or the worst. Or the funniest. And can I tell you something? It never is. You know something is going to be really funny when someone laughs all the way through it right? The dad you're not going to believe this funniest thing ever happened to me. Oh my god, it's a funny thing. Oh my god, wait that. Okay let's hear it. There's a girl running through the hall and she fell off and is the funniest thing ever. Oh dad please. When either one of my kids tells me stories, my face must just glaze over. Because all I am thinking is how in the world do some people have sex with their own children. Does that make sense to anyone else in this room? How does a human brain allow that kind of shit to take place? I am so utterly turned off by both of my kids in every single way. And by the way if you're not laughing right now, you're the creepiest person in this room. Because that as easily as anti-kid touching as it gets. I said how in the world, you know, earth, the world, the whole world, do some people have sex with their own children and some of you went, uh-uh. I'm protected, second amendment. Everybody knows you can't change an amendment Chad because a man means, all right hold on. That's how I'm going to start choosing hotels when I'm on the road. I'm going to walk into a lobby and be like how in the world do some people have sex with their own children. And if no one even looks up, I'll be like okay cool next hotel. Sometimes when I tell that story, someone will laugh so hard their shoulders will shake. And other times someone won't even smile. But on a magical night, those two people are sitting right next to each other. And I get so excited about the idea of that uncomfortable ride home. The air could you care if we stop by the gas station and get some skittles? I don't know Patrick, why don't you go fuck again? You heard me say skittles right? I know we're getting soft as a nation because I travel all around it and I hear soft noises in comedy clubs. One time heard a grown man go, oh, that's crazy. If that is the noise your body chooses to make, stay home always and forever. Because no one likes you for sure. But the worst noise I've ever heard of the comedy shows this one, I don't. Man or woman, that is the twattiest noise that can come out of the human body. You should be able to karate chop that out of somebody's throat. Hey man, how's your day? I don't. Fwatt! Hatt! Hatt! I would rather hear choking than hear that noise. Because you know who makes that noise? It's people that wake up every morning and think, how could I be a victim today? And you know who I'm talking about. It's people that don't get enough attention at work, they don't get enough attention at home. So they're on social media posting all these vague ass statuses. Sure could use some prayers today. Post. It's like you can almost hear them typing it. I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't have to be kidding me. Knock it off. What do you need prayers for? Be specific. Everybody's worried sick about you. There's 150 comments and they're all some version of Mary sending good vibes your way. Raising the roof with prayer. Emoji. And four days later Mary comes back to meadows weren't as red as I'd hoped. Well fuck you Mary. I hope you get lupus and everybody's all prayed out. But your tomatoes are red, right? They'll have antioxidants, won't they, Mary? Best of luck to you little girl that cried prayer. How can we not test for the noise? Mmm, I don't, mmm. We can test for almost anything in utero, right? Let's get one of those fancy ultrasound machines and figure it out. That's your baby's heartbeat. Mmm, I don't, mmm. We should get that out of you immediately. Nobody wants another one of those walking around town. And you do not want to live with the third grader that doesn't want Oreos because they're made with hydrogenated oil. I don't, mmm. Fucking die. I'm just dying. When I hear the noise, mmm, I don't, mmm. I get ISIS. I get it. I understand starting a group to hurt other people. That makes sense to me. Does that mean I'm a joint ISIS? Of course not. But I scout for them. I don't know, probably. Hey man, how's your salad? Mmm, I don't, ISIS! I found one. You don't want to mess with ISIS, man. They're a crappy group. And we should have seen that coming because they are all caps. And you guys, that's yelling. How did we not know? I bet if you asked everybody in ISIS why they joined over 40% would say traffic. Because traffic can turn a reasonable rational human being into a murderous monster. You're ever going to the four-way stop and it's not your turn to go, but it's a person in front of you. It's their turn to go. But they're not going. They're doing this. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. No, you. A good, good, good, good, good, good, good. And you're behind him like, fuck it, go! You have to go, nobody's ever gonna go. There are rules in place for this situation. You're not going to get into heaven for letting somebody go first in a four-way stop. Because I'm going to stab someone and that shit's going on. Your tab. Go, go, go, go, go, go. It's going to lead to, gaga, gaga, gaga. Listen, you guys, you cannot be nice with someone else's time. That is not how kindness works. If you want to be nice, join the Big Brother or the Big Sister Program and bring a kid to the movie. But on your way to the theater, fuck in, go. You have to go. Now I want you to know traffic is the only time I get real upset. That's true. I'm a pretty laid back guy. I love walking around and seeing other people get mad. I think that's fun. Because I am a hypocrite and I like to judge others. And that makes me feel good. If I see a man yelling at his kids, I'm like, oh, I'm so much better than him. And that gets me through my day even though it's not true. My favorite kind of anger is self-produced anger. We've all seen that. Guy at the grocery store is holding the door. Somebody walks in. Doesn't say thank you and the guy holding the door is like, welcome! Oh my god. Has anyone ever needed to hear Drive Safe don't rate more than him? Like ever. What does he think? Everyone's just at the gym running on the treadmill, getting in shape. Does your hope somebody holds the door to store today? Can now wait to say thank you. It's crazy. People have other things going on in their lives, right? Even if it's something as small as remembering your list. When you're walking through the parking lot. Just milk, eggs, flour, welcome! Okay. Alright. Yeah, that was most likely for me. Are you holding the door? You were, right? Yeah. I was just trying to remember my list. Yeah, welcome! Nobody likes getting yelled at. Especially in public. Nothing good has ever happened from that. A guy is never like, oh, I should take that guy fishing. It's always something like, oh, I'd kill him for sure. That's why I admire psychopaths a little bit. I think psychopaths have figured some things out. I do. A psychopath thinks, I'm gonna kill that guy, and then they just kill him. And the rest of the day they're like, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. They're just so happy that their to-do list is done. But a man that fears societies rules, you can't go killing people all willing, nearly? Well, I just like, oh, I'm gonna kill that guy. But, eh, I'm already at this store, I should probably just get my stuff. Yeah, I'll do that. And then he goes in the store. But he hasn't forgotten that he's been yelled at. So 10 minutes later, he's walking around the frozen food section just like, okay, hold on. What do you mean, I'm welcome? Why am I welcome? You're welcome. How about that? You put thought about that? How about you be welcome? I just opened this freezer door. Didn't need your help there. Did I? I got goers all day. Fuck, welcome. And he strokes out in the frozen food section. And he forgets his list. And he goes home without milk, eggs, or flour. And his only job all week was to make his little daughter a birthday cake. You assholes. I mean, seriously. Let's review all the things we've talked about tonight. And cake, just shut you down, huh? We've talked about so many topics. You're like, not the cake. Don't you dare. My God, you're so nice. Stop. The Lord is a Lavendenver. You hear those? Just as a reminder, a man had just stroked out in a grocery store and nobody had any problem with that at all. And then I mentioned a girl not getting cake and you're like, Oh, God, is there a bakery he could stop at? Stop it a bakery and get some cake. It's a birthday. I need you to know something. When I wrote this story, I never even thought about that little girl for more than one second. I just needed something to do with those ingredients. So I picked cake because I like cake. This little girl is just supposed to go, Hey guys, and then leave the story. That's it. She's like, one second in, one second out. And you guys are like, come here. We'll get you some cake. Come on. You come here right now. This story is about a man on the verge of a mental breakdown. I just picture this man in his kitchen stirring an empty bowl with dead eyes. Still has his hospital bracelet on from the stroke. Just mumbling things like, hold it up for me, hold it up, you. Do you need you? Hope does. Automat Do you? You were waving at the camera. Not at the camera. It's father-in-law walks in the kitchen. How's the cake coming? F**k it, welcome! That glueses his mind. And a whole bunch of you were like, is there frosting at the house? Is there frosting at the house? Can we get this kid some frosting? Which is crazy to me. Because the point of this entire story is this. When a woman is breastfeeding a child, and the child is sick, that illness is in the child's saliva. It enters the mother's body through the aereola. It travels around the mother's body. The mother's body fixes it. It puts it back in the milk. It sends the cure out through the nipple. Kid feels better. Our noses can categorize 50,000 smells. Our eyeballs can see 10 million different colors. That is the potential of the human body. And you can't figure out a four-way stop. I know I have had a lot of problems with humanity up here tonight. But I also want you to know I think I give you friends with almost anybody. I mean, the only group of people I can think of that I wouldn't be friends with is if we're walking down the street, and we overhear somebody say finger bang and you don't even giggle. Then I don't care to have you a part of my life as a part of my life. Or we're going to go to your house and drink gin and do accounting. No, thank you. If you're an adult and you hear finger bang and you don't even go, okay, or like nothing, that creeps me out. That's why I like talking to really old people. Like 95 years old or you can say whatever you want around them. They're just glad you're talking. You could say finger bang in front of a 95-year-old woman and she'd be like, I remember finger banging. I was finger by Abraham Lincoln's nephew. Also a tall man, huge hands. I remember he removed his riding glove and it was like a fistful of dicks. It was thrilling. President Lincoln once said, a house divided cannot stand. Well, neither could I. Do old people can say or do whatever? That's how old men ended up as the creepiest things on the planet. I can't wait to be that old. I cannot wait until my actions don't have consequences. I'm not going to throw shit at people or be weird when I'm swimming, but I still want to have fun. When comedy's done, I don't have hobbies, so I'm not going to whittle recorders out of wood and bring them to middle schools. I'm just going to sit at the bus stop and then I'm going to flick guys in the dick when they walk by. And I know comedy's supposed to be smarter than that, but I don't care. Flicking dicks is really funny to me. I'm just going to sit at the bus stop with a big coat on, but my arms not in the sleeves. Then I'm going to sneak attack out the zipper. Flack! What are you doing? Doesn't matter. I'm old. I'm going to call the cops. Go ahead and you need to ride home. They're not going to rest an old man for flicking dicks, right? It's probably not even in the book. Hey, yeah. We're down at the bus stop and we have a... We have a... There's an old guy down here flicking dicks and dude, it is outrageous. I don't know. He's killing people. It's crazy. I don't know if his right shoulder is made up of only fast twitch muscle fibers, but this guy's unreal. He's beating younger men to their crutches, and my God is it fun to watch. And you know my rule, if I laugh it's on my don't make an arrest. I'm just going to eat my lunch here and watch over. Because dicks are not protected by the law. And I am in no way saying they should be. I'm telling you straight up, they're not. You flick a lady in the tin. Well, pack your shit because you're going to jail. What? As it should be. But you could curb stomp. A guy's bare dick. In front of a cop. And the cop would be like, it's probably going to be a stomach ache. Get you guys later. Nobody cares about this. That's why sometimes when I hear women go, we want equality. I always just want to whisper, yeah, but not all of it. You don't want the curb stomping part. Just take the good stuff. Take the M&Ms out of the trail mix. Leave the raisins. Because if you have a quality across the board and you get the good stuff, you're going to have to do things you don't want to do. Start calling your shots when you play pool. Hold on. Hold on for one second. I saw some women react like I said you were bad at pool. Those words never came out of my mouth. I never said women are bad at pool. I said your cheaters. That's different. It's going to be no more this. Oops, I made it in the wrong pocket, but I'm cute and you want to fuck me. So it's still mater and still mater and still mater. That goes out the door with equal pay. Now you're going to have to buy your own drinks and they're 1750 a piece. You didn't even know that did you. Back in the line, yoga pants. It's a quality night. If we have true equality between men and women, we're going to be able to fist fight in the middle of the street. And I can tell you, I don't want to live in a world like that. Because I would lose to upwards of 45% of women. Sounds like a high number, but let's go through the groups. White trash ladies. Uh-huh. And lose to most of them. Because they're tricky. They've had to get out of some tight spots by thinking on their feet. A white trash lady will say something like, look at my tits! And when you do, they hit you with something real hard. Probably a glass ashtray. Every single kung fu movie, little Asian girl skipping to school. Old Asian guy walks around the corner, you're skipping is stupid. And she floats up into the air and murders him with face kicks. You're going to have to factor in all little Asian girls to that. Every single one of them. Because you don't know which ones can float. They don't put stickers on them. You're going to have to factor in all black women and start removing their earrings as they're moving towards you. Because I don't care what martial art you've trained in, gentlemen. That's going to be a loss on your record. If you make a black woman so upset with you for whatever bullshit you're doing and she pulls her earring off and goes, what? Just go, nothing, nothing, nothing! And you run. And you find shelter. And may I suggest a body of water. Now, some of you are going to be pretty surprised by this next part. Because a lot of you think, I think black people don't swim. And that's the craziest thing I've ever heard in my whole life. You can't think an entire group of people doesn't do one thing. That's ridiculous and how bad stuff starts. I know black people swim. I've seen black people swim. What I have never seen and no one has is a black woman that just got her hair done. Get it wet on purpose. That has not happened since the beginning of time. And black people were the first people. They've had more time. A black woman will fall you into a body of water but just up to her hair. And they should be like, nope. And back it on out. And then you just shredding water in the lake. Are you going to leave? I took the afternoon off to get my hair done. I have nowhere to be. I saw a black lady leave the hair salon one time. She looked up. It started raining on her hair. And she looked up into the sky and she goes, no. And it stopped raining. So, you know, still think Jesus is white? I know I talk a lot of crap about my son up here. But I do want you to know that he's a very respectful young man. And he is a smart, like, too smart maybe. And he has a very dry sense of humor to the point where you don't know if it's a joke or if you're going to get murdered. Right, you wake up the next day and you're like, there's funny, buddy. The job is like, funny joke. Oh my god, I'm alive. It's like that kind of sense of humor. We were walking down the street one day. It was my son and my daughter and I. And an Asian family was walking towards us and there were seven of them. And none of them were higher. I don't get it. There were seven of them? Is that like a weird thing to say? Ah, fucking legalized pot. Here's what happens. I don't have to say anything funny. You just present a fact and people were like, oh my god. Dad, you're not going to believe what happened to me. Oh my god, it was a funny thing. We were walking towards an Asian family. There were seven of them. None of them were higher than my chest. Now, does that mean I think all Asian people are short? No, of course not. I know Asian people are taller than me. I'm just telling you, these are the facts of this particular story. So the grandparents passed us and then the parents passed us and the children passed us. And my son slowed down and he looked at me and he goes, do you think Godzilla was just a normal sized lizard? And my daughter said, isn't that racist? And I said, we will figure that out when I'm done laughing. Because sometimes you just got a letter buck. I brought my son to a comedy festival in Nebraska. It was Johnny Carson's hometown. And I was always such a huge fan of Johnny Carson. I wanted to show my son some history. They have a museum there and everything. So we went there and we had a great time. And before the first show, we were in the green room. It was me, a couple of friends, my son. And then two comedians walked in that I had never met. So they didn't know me and they certainly didn't know my son. And so they thought he was a comedian. And they were like, how old are you? And they go, oh you think you're going to go out there and wow the adult crowd with your 18-year-old humor? Is that right? Is that what you're going to do? Sure. And they're going to live with your parents and somebody whisper to me. They go, are you going to help your son? And I was like, no, I sharpen this stick. I know how, folks. So the guy was just giving it to my son. And he's finally done on my kid goes, yeah, thank you very much for that. I really appreciate the advice. Do you mind if I say something I like about your act? And they go, let's go for it. He goes, I really like how you smile at the end of your jokes to let people know they're finished since the punchlines don't do the trick. Everybody's slowly looked at me. I was just like, daddy, raise you right! So cool. But that wasn't even my favorite. At the end of the week, there was a former Miss Nebraska there, just a lovely woman. She was like the town celebrity so nice. And she invited us all to her home to have a buffet at the end of the week. And so we got there. It was my friend Joe, my friend Phil, my son and myself. And we got there late. And there were no plates left. And Phil is from Canada. And I only tell you that to let you know that he doesn't care about others. So we walked in and there were no plates left at the buffet. And there were three plates on the kitchen wall. And Phil goes, can I use one of these? And she goes, no, you may not. And he goes, why not? And she started crying. And through tears, she told us this story about how her mom had left Europe with just 12 plates in the clothes on her back. And then she met the husband and they had four kids. And they all got three plates. And all four of those kids had three children of their own. So they were all going to get one plate. And Phil goes, is that it? And she goes, yes it is. And he goes, well I'm hungry, I'm going to get food. And he turned, but he had a backpack on. And it knocked a plate off of the wall. And it shattered. And the only thing you could hear in the kitchen, was the clock ticking. And this woman sobbing. And my son goes, God damn it Phil, now she's going to have to kill one of her kids. I mean come on. This lady went from crying to laughing. And she goes, oh I like you. And my son goes, enough to go to the kitchen. And she goes, oh I like you. And my son goes, enough to go to the kitchen. And my son goes, enough to let me pick which kid. It's just like a superhero who doesn't know how to use his powers yet. I'm flying, is that a wall smash? Thank you guys very much, I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You guys are the best. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hey tight, hang tight. I want to tell you one more story, you can sit back down if you'd like. What a weird way to ruin a standing ovation. When I was starting comedy, I had zero money. And so my son was about to be born. And so I called this booking agent and I go, hey man, is there any way you can give me any work at all? I just really need to make some money. And he goes, how about this week? And I go, that's not going to work because that is the week my son is going to be born and I need to be around for that. And he goes, well good luck because children ruin comedy careers. So I would like to introduce you to two people that beg to differ. This is my son Isaac, my daughter Olivia. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Pretty good, huh? Do you have anything to say? I just want to let you all know that I start my job on Monday. Anything? Anyone bring their passport? Kids do not ruin comedy careers. They make them. But more importantly, these two have just made my life a million times better. So I just wanted to tell you guys that because I know I pick on them a lot. But they are the best. And thank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you. You're burning as a pain. You're burning for pain. Don't leave me, don't give him to cheat. Let's play fair and not compete. Would you let me know that you hold my hand? Would you call it a loss? I wish me dead.

It's like 4 play, 1,900. For the women to talk to you and get you sexier rals. I called one up last week. You know that stuff costs $4 for the first minute, $9.9 for each additional minute for some woman to talk to you and get you sexier rals? I called up some lady. I laid a stutter. She called me 415, motherfucker, dollars, y'all. She ain't telling me I'm a bippa baby. What you want to do? I know what you want to do. I know what you want to do. I'm not. What you want to do? I'm not. This shit is costing me, baby. I go on bison boating and have change for that kind of money. I'm saying. I love you, L.A. I love you women out here, but women are so fine. I'm glad it's getting cold. Oh, man, glad it's getting cold. Yeah, because the fashion's, man. I'm glad Biker shorts about played out. Consistors, you have some beautiful bodies, but all y'all can't wear Biker pants. Hell, just cause your girl look nice and don't mean your ass gonna look good on them. You know what I'm saying, fellas? Tell you that one rule, women, if you're not sure you can wear Biker pants, it's one rule. Go like this. If your stomach is bigger than your ass, you can't wear them. It'll often fall to be put up to women. Hey, good, you got nice, healthy ass. It's stomach. Goddamn, I thought it was your ass, girl. Fuck this. Shit. I saw this girl in the mall, man, today, I ain't seen her since high school. Fine, little girl, try to see her since high school. She had a child with her too, man. Cute little girl, you know she had a baby. I said, girl, what's up? I ain't know you had a kid. How did your baby? She said, my little shunt, tell you. She's 34 months old. I'm standing there thinking, how many times is 12 going to 34 with shit? Okay, what? How does one month, I got time to add to track? Break it down for me, baby. Shit. One, two. Break it down for me. I ain't got no time. Shit. You know, I read in the paper some stupid stuff, y'all. This homeboy got shot over his $130 pair of tennis shoes. Is that the stupid thing to do? Think about it. If you should have brought all his tennis shoes, you ain't guaranteed a shirt fit. No, why is it? Why am you shooting me so small? He walked around with a hundred and a half of a corn on your feet and shit. Gave you no ball with them. And I know about being shot, y'all. I got shot a couple years ago. Yeah, man, hang on to my boys, think I'm cool. I got shot three times. Shot in the hand, the calf, and in the back. Running my mouth, my fellas. I mean, McDonald's, I order some food. We walk out to my car, we jam and hand it good times. Think about what party you want to go to. All of a sudden his brother approached us. He started talking trash. Now I'm with my boys. I'm gonna talk trash back. I'm like, what's up? What's up? What you want to do? What you want to do? They got to pull the gun out. And I said, hey, what's up? Being pie my brother? You're not being pie. Shit, pie, pie, pie. I just started shooting and everybody was running. And you're like, oh, she shot me in the leg first. I'm like, oh, shit, this thing. You're crazy.

God bless, I'm outta here.

 Ladies and gentlemen, Kelsey Cook! Jennifer, how are you feeling? Wow, I think you guys so much for coming out. Feel so good to be back in the land of hot, outdoorsy couples. Look at all of you. It's a treat for my eyeballs. I love it. Except I could never tell with you Denver dudes if you're actually hot or if you just have facial hair. You know what I mean? You guys always have a hat, mustache, beard, an IPA blocking your nose and mouth. I'm like, are you attractive? You just cover a 90% of your face. Because we all think that cats are cute until you see a hairless cat. And then you're like, kill it with fire. No. Any time I've seen one I've been like, is it sick? And the owner's always like, no, we actually paid $5,000 for him. So I'm like, for gollum with a collar? Why? I'm gonna just blow my nose into Kleenex and hand it at you for free. It looks the same. It's just runny shapes. I don't like it. I'm glad you guys came out. I know that everybody said a really crazy past couple years. I hadn't especially crazy 2020. I actually got divorced a week before COVID hit. Yeah. So who's ready for some comedy? I just start crying. No, it's okay. I think the craziest part about getting divorced is having to change your emergency contact back to your mom. It would be less embarrassing to use a stranger from Craigslist. True like. But other than that, it went pretty smoothly. Like, we still have a lot of love and respect for each other. He's also a comedian, so we didn't have a lot of assets to split up. It's not like there was a summer house and a boat. It was like, do you want the Batman begins DVD? Who gets the good spatula? And after some time had passed, we decided that we were going to try and be friends again. And that's always a little weird. The first time you try hanging out with an ex as a friend. When he saw me, he fist bumped me. I was like, well, honestly, I would rather have you fist me. That would feel less physically uncomfortable. Then this night, Mary, you just put us through. Hey, to that. Absolutely not. And I've had the deadly peanut allergy for most of my life. So for the eight years we were together, he had a stop eating peanut products. Because if he did and then kissed me, my throat could close. So when I saw him, I was like, oh, what's a like to eat peanut butter again? He goes, oh man, we should have broken up a long time ago. I don't even blame him. Have you had peanut butter? I can't compete with that. I hate that the person I'm with has to give that up. That puts way too much pressure on me to be worth the trade off. Right? Like, you're going to rob a man of Reese's for the rest of his life. Bitch, you better be pretty open-minded in the bedroom. I'm going to make a man stop swallowing something delicious. Well, get ready to start swallowing something gross. You had to fill the void that snickers left. I'm missionary with the lights offing and I cut it anymore. So I had to learn some new moves and watch some tutorials. That's what I call porn. It's just, uh, just educational for me now. I just watch with a little notepad like, oh, pretend to gag. Seems good. I do think it's easy when you get married to stop trying as hard in bed, but God, if you get divorced and you start trying a date again, it's like having to come back out of retirement. You know, it's like you got to start stretching, get ready to run another BJ5K. Like, no, I just did this. If somebody moved the finish line back another 10 years, oh, can't even see it. Do we have any married people here tonight? That was a pretty sad sound. You guys were faking it a little bit. So I mean, you just treated it like a silent auction. You were like, it's just so sad. Anybody here been married for a really long time, like over 20 years? You guys are so cute. How long have they married? 21, give it up for 21. That's a long time. Yeah. So you guys get it. If you've been working the same job for over two decades, you start to cut some corners. Right. But if it is your first week at a new blow job, you are hustling. You're just starting. I'm sure you do to figure it out by now that the best blow job you ever get from us is the first blow job. Because women were so competitive, we know that you're about to compare us to every other one you've ever had. So we just enter the arena that night like I will be queen. Give me that. Pull out all our tips and tricks, hurt our knees, throw our back out. We want a trophy. We will give head to get ahead. But then you get married and you start to treat blow jobs like you're assembly Nike furniture. Just skip a few steps and by the end you're like, next time I'm hiring somebody else to do this. Low righty tidy lefty, you'll see the skin of hell out of here. We got to go to Costco. I tried to avoid the whole post break up identity crisis. One of my friends went through a break up and she got this dramatic haircut afterward as a revenge move against Rex. She's like, if he sees me, he's going to know he missed out on this whole other me. Like a guy has ever seen a haircut and been like, I never got a fuck asymmetrical lob Lisa. Bullshit. You guys never know when we change our hair, right? You're not even observing of yourselves. Before the divorce, I was cuddling with my ex and I felt like my leg had been stabbed. I looked down. His toenails looked like he cut them with his teeth. They were all jagged. He could unlock a secret door in a haunted house. I was like, do you have a best friend with a matching jagged toenail? You put them together and make a best friend like this? Is that what you're doing? I turned his toe into a prison ship. I was like, what is this? He goes, I just didn't notice. Oh, I sure did. When you shanked my Achilles tendon, I'm bleeding out. I feel like this stuff only gets worse with you guys with age. We've all seen the really old men with thick tuffs of raccoon hair growing out of their ears. I'm sure that guy's wife has been telling him to trim it for years and he just can't hear her. You want my hat? It's like yelling into a fan. It's coming right back in your face. I just sat next to a very old man on a plane recently and I had my notebook out and he leans over and goes, it's nice to see somebody riding and nod on their phone. When I was like, he doesn't know I'm riding jokes about cum. I was like, oh, suddenly candy crush doesn't seem so bad, huh, Wendell? When I booped him, booped him on the nose. Love that Wendell. Does feel a little weird to start over now in my 30s, but at least I know now what I like, don't like in a relationship. For example, I don't care about my body. I don't care about my body. I don't care how hot you are. I'm still never going to eat your ass. Not a fan of the devil's chocolate. No, thank you. And I'm fair about it. I don't ask anybody to eat my neither. Okay. There's no need. Women have a lot of holes down there. It's like a mini golf course. Just skip the one that's in a lagoon. Just... Don't even look at it. I have never wanted to do that to one of you guys. Most of you dudes have real blue collar ass holes. Not a lot of maintenance going on back there. That thing works at loads. I don't trust you. I don't trust it. It's like blindly sticking your face between two couch cushions. It's just... Goldfish crackers. Part of a broken Christmas ornament. It's a choking hazard, frankly. I'm not going to swallow a paperclip so you can come a new way. And that is the joke I wrote next to Wendell on the plate. Now you know. And I don't know if I'm alone in this. But I didn't even hear about eating ass until later on in life. And when I did, I was like, Why is that even on the menu? Because I'm not going to eat it. I'm not going to eat it. I'm not going to eat it. I'm not going to eat it. I'm not going to eat it. I'm not going to eat it. I'm not going to eat it. I'm not going to eat it. Because I'm not going to eat it. Because I'm not going to eat it. Because I'm not going to eat it. Because I'm not going to eat it. You go to hell. I'm not going to eat it. And keep eating sane. You don't know how to use RPD understand how the people who are eating ass all the time aren't getting violently ill. I have been washing my produce for 32 years to avoid equal life. Bob's supposed to take my mouth and go straight to the source. Just drink from the hose. I don't trust you dudes to wash a frying pan correctly. Let alone your assholes. Not dying at 32 from Brad's butthole. Dreams and goals to accomplish. Have you guys been drinking tonight? Wow. You're fucking hammered Christ. I've knocked me backward. Some of my friends actually got sober during quarantine. And if I'm being honest with you, I found it unacceptable. I was like, I just got divorced and needed to ramp it up with me. Now is not the time for you to be a better person. You're actually being selfish. Some of them took the AA quiz online so I took it with them and it turns out it makes everybody sound like they're an alcoholic. The next question is, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood? Like, is there any other reason? Who was like, no one minute for the acne and diarrhea? I'm a purist. The second question is, after consuming alcohol, have you ever done something you've regretted? Do you mean literally every time? Who's getting drunk and doing the Lord's work? I've never had five margarines and been like, all right, time to donate blood. I've passed this party on to someone in need. My biggest regrets stem from alcohol. When I was in college, I used to take shots of gin and chase them with deli meat. You know your white trash when your cocktails involve ham? And it's not great. But I feel like if you're broken college, you form weird habits like that. Like if you don't have a dishwasher, you try and cook using as few dishes as possible. I wouldn't know if you guys do this. Like, if you want banana on your cereal, but you don't want to get a knife dirty, do you ever just tear pieces off with your teeth and then... No. The creatures come out at night. I didn't even know that was weird until my ex caught me doing it. And was like, are you mama birding yourself? You need to get some help. I was like, I learned this while I worked at IHOP. So I don't want to hear it. Time is money. I'm being efficient. You know, like that Disney villain laugh in a shadows? What the fuck was that? I like that on the special. That's good. Keep that weird shit up. I did so much drunk shit in college. At one point, my friends and I went to Vegas. I got hammered. I ate a bunch of food, passed out, woke up the next morning, went to the pool. And when I looked down, there was like white powdery stuff in my belly button. And I was like, oh god. Did I do coke for the first time last night? And so I touched it, and I tasted it. And I was like, oh, Parmesan cheese. My friends told me that apparently I ate seven slices of pizza, like a wild boar. And then the process just jumped a loose quarter cup of bar down my shirt. And then let it collect in my belly button, like some sort of pizza hutsch stripper. So, made some really good choices in my life. I do think I made an actual good choice recently. I just quit being vegan after a year and a half of doing it. I'm back, baby! Back in these meat streets. Oh, man. Does it feel good to have friends again? Yeah. No one wants you around. My ex-husband and I, we went vegan together on January 1st, 2020. And then two months later, we were divorced. Am I saying that veganism ruins my... Yeah, yeah, yeah. But if we kept on eating nachos, we would have been too happy and too sleepy to notice our problems. There's not a lot of divorce in the Midwest. People think it's religion. It's cheese curts. Cheese can do what God can't. A couple hasn't had sex in 20 years. But they eat a cheese curtain and go, you know what? One more day. I'll think about divorce tomorrow, but right now, I'm gonna face fuck this cheddar. I'm gonna get lost in this plate. So, I just saw something online that burned my eyes. I just found out that I'm on wiki feet. Does anybody here know what wiki feet is? A few of you nodding. A lot of dudes that are like, don't make eye contact with me right now. If you don't know what wiki feet is, it's a website for people with foot fetishes. So, women, if you post a photo on Instagram that shows your little tootsies, the foot folks might do a copy and paste onto wiki feet and then zoom in on your toes and make their keyboard sticky. I know. It's like scrapbooking for men who need Jesus. It's a nice hobby. I know that sounds like I'm King Shaman. I'm really not trying to. Honestly, I am so jealous that some people can get off from that. Like, I wish I could just stare to dudes hairy kneecap. And get tingles in my basement. What a life. I would live on wiki knees. Oh, have we get nothing done? So much harder than that. So, somebody told me that there's this profile of me on wiki feet. And at first, I heard that I was like, oh, is that mean I have hot feet? Hmm. I'm so flattered. Then when I looked, I saw that the foot fetish community has rated my feet only 2.3 out of 5 stars. Which they call OK feet. I was like, oh, apparently I have apple-bees feet. It's like, you'll put it in your mouth, but you won't tell anybody about it. I think about 2 for Tuesday deal. And a few months before the pandemic hit, some dude slid into my DMs and just said, two grand for foot-vid. Now, Denver, make some noise if you would send a video of your feet to a stranger for $2,000. Oh, my God. Godless animals, all of ya. My ears. Jesus. Somebody just throw your ariola up on Facebook for $1. Hanson, Uncle, CNN, you don't give a shit. And you're like, venmo me my dollar, Aunt Sherry, I earned this. This is a solid nip. Well, I appreciate your honesty. I wasn't quite as sure about it. That's all you were. I was like, I don't know this guy. He's going to have a video of my feet for the rest of his life. It's too weird. I'm not doing it. But then COVID hit. And I lost all my comedy work. So two days later, I wrote him back. I got desperate so fast. I was like, all right, man, 2 grand from the feet. I'm ready. Let's do it. And he never responded. I got ghosted by the foot guy. Do you know how humiliating it feels to lower your morals and your values? Only to have a foot guy be like, no, I'm good now. Like what? What happened? It's like the smelly kid coming up to you at prom and you're like, all right, fine, one dance. And he's like, I was just going to ask you where the bathroom is. You're like, fuck you, Travis. Out of here. Just trying to be nice. I love my mom so much. She's amazing. But she's been trying to give me career advice and none of it's helpful. You know, she doesn't understand that there are different levels of fame and comedy. She thinks that all comics are best friends. She'll be like, why don't you call Jerry Seinfeld? And ask to do comedians and cars getting coffee. And I'm like, mom, I can't even get a guy to jerk off to my feet. Let's lower expectations. Like this is where my career is at. I have a Fuseball web series on YouTube. Okay, I'm like here. When my mom heard that, she goes, you know who I bet. Would love to do your YouTube show. Ellen DeGeneres. I was like, oh, you bet, huh? Well, let's put some money on it because I bet she fucking wouldn't. If I win, you have to let me back on your cell phone plan. She's always trying to find ways to get me on television. Like when she heard I was getting divorced, she sent me a text that said, now that you're single, you can go on the bachelor or Miss America. It's like, yeah, because marriage is what was holding me back. From becoming Miss America. Pretty sure a part of the qualifications include, Hasn't been paid in Jello Shots to tell dick jokes. So I don't think I'm getting it. Let's talk about the Fuseball web series. So my entire family and I are actually world champion Fuseball players. Thank you. I know it sounds made up. I swear it's real. My parents met playing in a professional Fuseball tournament in the 80s. So I literally wouldn't exist if it weren't for Fuseball. Which is sad. But you know, some of you wouldn't exist if it weren't for boxed wine. So it's like, yeah, whatever. We're all a little garbage. It's not judge each other. It gets rid of not only is my dad a pro Fuseball player. He's also a slam poetry champion. And an international yo-yo man. Yeah. My dad has the sex appeal of a fanny pack. Crush in it. And my mom is in the Fuseball Hall of Fame. And they've been training me to play since I was like two years old. But since no one suspects that I'm a pro Fuseball player, I love to hustle people. And so I usually play against other comedians on my web series. But we did this special episode where I went undercover in Vegas. And I hustled drunk dudes on the Vegas strip. So I wore this low cut top. I talked in the worst voice. And my camera crew and I would go up to groups of guys and I go, hi, my name's Kelsey. And I have this web series where I do things that I've never done before for the first time. It's called Pop My Cherry. It's silly, you know. So I've never played Fuseball before and we just found this table. And I was just wondering if you guys want to play me. And every group of guys is like, oh yeah, bitch, let's go. Yeah, player I know. So I would play the first game terribly on purpose. Right, I would giggle a bunch, spin the rods a lot, really build up their confidence. And then I go, okay, so I think I've got to hang of it now. And this is Vegas. So we should play for money. And every guy would put their whole wallet on the table. And they'd hand me the ball and go, here, you can serve first. And that's when I pull out my Fuseball grip glove. Checkmate, motherfucker. Yeah, I've never done cocaine, but I would assume it's a similar rush. I've only done Parmesan cheese, which also exhilarating. A lot cheaper. So I mentioned that, I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. So I mentioned that my ex and I, we were together for a really long time. So we knew so much about each other. But one thing that he didn't know about me until toward the end, I told him that sometimes I pee in the shower. And by sometimes, I mean every time. And don't you guys act like you don't do it too. We are all swamp monsters. There is no drug in the history of time with a higher addiction rate than peeing in the shower. You think you're better than that? You think you're above doing it? And then you let yourself do it one time. And you're like, I guess I'm doing this every day for the rest of my life. It is the best. I feel like I'm on vacation every day. Just care for you, Livin. And I thought that he and I were going to bond over it. Maybe we had the same dirty little secret. And instead, he was like, what? Oh, gross. That means every time I shower, just been standing in your pee. I was like, I do it while I'm showering. Like the water takes it down the drain immediately. You're acting like I walk into our bathroom. Drop my pants, stand in the shower, and just piss on dry porcelain like a cereal killer. And then get out, put my pants back on, and just leave you a puddle of urine like a feral cat. I was like, I'm going to start peeing on your pillow, give me some real problems. This is nonsense. One of my friends told me that apparently we're all supposed to throw our pillows away once a year and get new ones. You guys been doing that? Feels good to be gross together, huh? We all have such a weird attitude toward pillows, because they cost like ten bucks. But we all keep the same disgusting pillows for decades. Like it's the great depression. Like we're some old prospector. Like, well, this year's the pillow they gave me at the orphanage, and we got damned if this ain't the same pillow I'd die with. Why? Pillow's antels, right? Like we never get rid of towels. They just eventually become the ones you like dry the dog with. Where are you holding on to so many? Do we all think we're going to have like a home birth someday? Yeah, sobs some stuff up. My grandparents' towels are historical artifacts at this point. I don't know if you visited your elders recently. They have washcloths that look like they were woven from wheat. And like, did this belong to Jesus? I feel like I'm drying my face with a trisket. My eyelids are bleeding. So I got on dating apps for the first time last year. And they let me on to the celebrity dating app, which, listen, obviously they use the term celebrity real loosely. Okay. If they saw my wiki feet, they'd be like, absolutely not. We got... She can't sit with us. Yeah, they let in somebody who's 32 and still shops at Forever 21. So I for sure checked them. I know that store is trash, but I just can't stop going. I just love it so much. The last time I was there, I told the girl the register that I found a makeup stain on this tank top I wanted. And I asked if I could get a discount. And she just stared at me with dead eyes and was like, It's already only 2.99. Like... Do you want us to just give you the tank top? And pay off your student loans. This is Forever 21, everything stained. It's basically an animal shelter. God, I love that store. The first date I went on through the celebrity app was such a disaster. I went out with this guy who was from Europe originally. So yeah, this really thick European accent. And some of the words he said sounded like other words. So he's telling me about his cat and he goes, Yeah, you know, I love my cat, but he rapes my shirt. And my brain was like, That can't be right. No. So I sat with it for a second and I was like, Oh, oh, he rips your shirts. Okay, sorry, I just, I thought you said that he rapes your shirts. And with zero hesitation, this dude goes, Yeah, no, he rapes my shirts and I don't understand why. Because he's neutered, but he will not stop raping my shirts. So then I had to hide my shirts and then I gave him a blanket. And now that's his rape blanket. And I'm like, what the fuck am I on a hidden camera show? Where if this dude says rape 18 times before dessert, he wins a jet ski? Is this one of 10 Bundy's kids? I just started covering all my holes. I was like, I don't like this. This is a bad, bad vibe. So I was like, I'm going to give this five more minutes. So he starts telling me that he goes on boats a lot. And I was like, Oh, you ever worry about shark attacks? And I swear to God, he goes, Yeah, no, you don't really have to worry about sharks so much. But you do have to worry about dolphins because they are the rapists of the scene. I was like, All right, I'm out of here. Bye. Enjoy the jet ski. I'm sure you won. And lunatic. That was my first dating app experience. Fortunately, it's been better since then. I'm seeing a guy in his 40s now. He has adult children. Okay, he has lived more life than I have. He knows more things. And I told him that I was hesitant to hook up with them the first time because I was on my period. And he goes, Oh, good. You guys are ever grossed out by that. You're just shutting your uterine lining. I was like, That is the hottest thing that anybody's ever said to me. I didn't even know that's what happens during my period. I was like, Okay, Grace and that of me. The bar is said real low after all rate blanket. So I just do a gentle hop over into my heart, you know, with your snapple fun facts about periods. Well, I don't know any of those things. Somebody could come up to me on the street with a microphone and be like, Ma'am, for a million dollars. What happened during your period? And I'd be like, I'm going to go with the egg is melting. And be like, were you homeschooled? My parents were playing foosball. I don't know. And teach me these things. He's also the first guy I've ever been with who has had a sect to me. So I had some questions about that. I was like, when you finish, is it clear? Like that white gatorade flavor? Just have glacier frost on tap? What's going on? I'm just trying to prepare myself. I was like, does it taste better when there aren't kids in it? It's like, maybe it's just air, right? Like one of those pressurized keyboard dusters that's like, she'll like, oh, startles you. You got to point it away or you'll lose an eye. You maybe fix a tire. Finally, I just went, Bill and I on his ass. I was like, I am blowing you in the name of science. This is field research at this point. And it turns out it's like normal. I guess it's kind of like, beyond burger? Like it looks the same. And then once it's in your mouth, you're like, something's missing. This is like, diet cum. It's another joke I wrote next to Wendell. He got an eye full of that flight. I saw some things. A lot of my friends are getting engaged and married right now. And one of them just had an engagement party with her fiance. And they played one of those games where they have signs that say, him and her and they held them up when they got asked questions. Like, who's the better cook? Who takes longer to get ready? Mayor. We're all just like, oh my god. Like you guys are getting married. Let's get into some real shit. Who has a drinking problem? Who's settling? I'm like, let me run this game. We'll call it getting cold feet. Let's test drive this son of a gun. So one of the things that I learned that was hard and going from being married and living with somebody for eight years and being single and living alone is that no one touches you anymore. And I know it sounds weird to say it like that. But if you live with somebody, there's like a fair amount of touching that happens throughout the day. So my lowest point in quarantine, I started watching ASMR videos on YouTube where a girl would hold a hair brush up to the camera lens. And she would simulate that she was brushing your hair. And I would just ram my forehead up against my laptop. Like, oh, pet me, Rachel. You dirty bitch. As soon as businesses opened up, I made all of the touching appointments. I was like, I'm getting a massage. I'm getting a manicure. Look, I made a dentist appointment just because I'm misfeeling somebody in my mouth. Okay, don't you judge me. It was hard. My dentist is this like 65-year-old Armenian man. I was like, flasadab, daddy. He was your toys. He was like, I prefer you call them tools. I was like, Demetri, I need this. How's your lips? Just tell me when to spit. One of the appointments I had made was for a bikini wax. And I had been going to salons before COVID to get bikini waxes. I had tried doing some of those like, at home kits. And I just learned that there are some parts of my nuthers that I do not have the strength of spirit to wax myself. Listen to me, if you can wax your own lips, you're a psychopath. That is some Steve O'Jackass level masochism. I want no part of it. So I had been going to the salons, and then the salons closed for six months, and things got scary. There's so many beautiful women here tonight. I feel like a lot of women started 2020 with like, a landing strip. And by July it was just a full airport. You can land anywhere. There's a cinnabon and a panda express. There's a shuttle that takes you to a rental car lot. I mean, employees, W9s, it's a lot going on. So finally, the salons open back up, and I immediately made an appointment. And I remembered there's that rule that the hair has to be at least a quarter inch long in order for the wax to be able to pick it up. And... Do we need a medic? Are you okay? Too much for you. She's like, it's a 730 show. I didn't know what this was. I don't like hockey, and we had a group on, but I... She's like, this is not the Christian way. I'm sorry. Oh yeah. So I remembered there's that rule that the hair has to be at least a quarter inch long in order for the wax to be able to pick it up. And I looked down and was like, well, that's not going to be a problem. But for the first time in my life, I worried that maybe it's bad if the hair is longer than a quarter inch. So I called the salon. So embarrassing. I was like, hey, I have an appointment today. Spent a rough quarantine. Is there like a maximum hair requirement? And this poor girl just goes, I mean, how long are we talking? And I wasn't prepared to answer that. So I panicked and was like, we could probably donate it. No. I don't know if locks of love specifies which type of hair they accept, but maybe somebody needs fake eyelashes. I don't know. We don't know where that hair comes from. I'll just throw them on and pray in, but it could be pubes. Basically, I feel like a lot of us were walking around, kind of looking like the opposite of a porn star in 2020, right? Which is totally fine. My friend Jay actually told me that my celebrity look alike. Is this porn star named Jesse Rogers? So I googled her. And the first picture that popped up was her doing hardcore anal. And got a little creeped out, realizing that my friend Jay saw that and thought, you know who this reminds me of old, gaping, but whole, Kelsuru. Yeah. Old back door cook. Look at her go. A plus. What is the matter with you Jay? But by the way, it's so nice to be able to tell that joke in person again, because I've had to tell it on mostly virtual shows the past two years. And I realized that halfway through the joke, everybody would just open a new browser. It would just get really quiet. And I'd be like, hello? Everybody show me your hands. I don't trust you. What are you doing? I had to check into a hotel on the road recently. And it was early in the morning and the woman checking me out, which is a little older. And she goes, I just have to tell you, you look so much like Amy Adams. I don't know if you ever hear that, but you really look like her. And it took all of my strength to not pull my phone out and be like, you know who everybody else says I look like? It's really blaster with a B hole at 8 a.m. I just couldn't do it. I do think that, Jesse Rogers and I, we do look alike. We have some different hobbies. I've never just sat on a lava lamp. For example. My ex has been and I, we didn't even buy a sex toy until seven years into their relationship. We had just been Flintstone in that shit. Just very little house on the prairie. Just churn and butter, very innocent. We didn't buy one of those vibrating, want things. And I got to be honest, never liked it. Way too intense for me. Even on the lowest setting, this thing is like for blasting rocks. I was like, is this where you women have been using this whole time? I barely touched it to my body. My feet lifted off the ground. I took flight. I was not turned on and all. I was terrified. I was like, did I just puree my clit? Oh my god. No, no, no, no, no, no. This thing is meant for industrial kitchens, okay? It's for liquefying raw vegetables. It's crazy. So I ended up asking some of my friends about it and it turns out that they have this toy and they use it on the highest setting in order to have an orgasm. I was like, how have you not completely erased your vagina? You can just sand it it down to a smooth slab of granite. Like a Barbie crotch. Go bowling on it. And so then I've learned about you dudes. It's not a lot of you guys like stuff that vibrates too. So one night before the divorce, my ex and I were out drinking. I had a few gin and hands. As you do. And when we got home, I just feel a little extra spicy. So I decided to crank it to 10 just to see what would happen. And the moment I touched it to his junk, his balls, whoop! When up inside his body, I didn't even know they could do that. I was just staring out and I'm like, oh. Do they stay up there until you sneeze really hard? How are you getting back? Have to do a hard man kegel? A couple minutes went by. Didn't see anything. I panicked. I started pushing on his belly bone really hard. Trying to eject quarters out of a ski ball machine. I was like, come on. Yeah, they're. Another few minutes. Still nothing. I was like, I think those are ovaries now. I'm sorry. I think I gave you an accidental gender change. Oops. So I'm in therapy. Anybody here in therapy? Oh, wow. That's a nice response. Usually it's just one person that's like, help. He's talking. Yeah, I think therapy is amazing. But I guess not everybody always needs therapy. Some people do need therapy. And you can usually tell who those people are because they say things like, I don't need any fucking therapy. I prefer to be a burden to my loved ones. You're like, sir, this isn't an Arby's. Why are you shouting? You're alarming the children. I had to work on my self-worth in therapy because I kept attracting some of the wrong people. One of my friends told me this quote. She said, once you know your worth, you'll stop giving people discounts. And I was like, well, slap my tits and call me Groupon, baby. Boy, I'm an out here like, hey, you got a personality disorder. And no job. This pussy's 90% off. Hey, hey, hey, hey. No credit. No problem. Get in here. That makes it sound like my life has been a dick buffet. It has not. I have a very low body count. I love it. That's what we call it. Body count, like we're all just fucking people to death. Like, dee-e. That sounds so system of a down for no reason. You know? I think I would have a higher body count if STDs didn't exist. But I'm just so terrified to ever get one that I don't want to gamble. Like, I just can't believe that in 2022, our best defense against them is still just condoms in the oner system. Scouts on her, bro. I'm like, you lied about your height. I'm supposed to trust you on Columbia. No. Okay, Crockes. Get out of here. I was reading online that some of the very first condoms back in the 1800s were really thick. Like, they used to basically just cut up bike tires. And they've obviously gotten thinner over time, which I'm sure was a guy's idea. You know? I bet the women back then were pissed. Like, keep it girthy. Keep that deep dish condom on. We don't have electricity. This is the only joy I have. I had a woman come to one of my shows recently, who I think was from the 1800s. She was very old. And she came up to me afterward. And she was like, I was a makeup artist for 30 years. And at this point, I'm thinking, I think she's about to compliment my makeup. That's so nice. And then she goes, your face was so oily when you were on stage. It was the only thing I could look at. The lights were heading at so bright that I had to squint to look at you. And that's when I heard my brain say, well, tonight's the night we go to jail for throat-punching someone's nana. Do you just hit a certain age where you walk around like, fuck it, burn it to the ground? Is this traumatizing people? I'm like, who is this woman's poor husband? You know, we gotta save him. I just picture him getting out of the shower and she's like, your balls make me sick. Of course, I didn't say any of that to her. I was just like, what powder do you recommend? I have no backbone. I've also become self-conscious of this very specific thing. Did you girls have that dress code in middle school? Were you had to wear shorts that were longer than the length of your fingertips to your sides? Okay. All right, to prevent girls from wearing booty shorts. So that was the day I learned I have freakishly long arms. For my short height. I'm only 5'4". All the girls had a line up. We put our arms down. I don't know if you can see what's happening right now. I'll show you on this side, too. But I did this and I looked down and I was like, oh no. I'm gonna have to wear men's jean coat jeans to not get expelled. I'm just rolling in a homeic with my chain wallet and lugs like... I spigged these muffins, Diane. The third member of the insane clown posse. I don't know much about the insane clown posse, but it does make me laugh. Picture those guys having to take their makeup off at the end of the night. Because they seem so tough on stage. I'm gonna stab this dude and bang your chick. And then two hours later, they're like, these new Tegina wipes are lovely. Don't burn my eyes. So before I started headlining, I used to open on tour for a comedian named Jim Norton. Anybody here, Jim Norton fan? Nice. Got some Jim heads in the house. So Jim's favorite thing to do is to humiliate people. And I made the mistake of telling him that I embarrassed very easily for a comedian. And he just milked that every day for three years on tour. When we were in public, he would constantly accuse me of shoplifting. We would be checking out at a CVS pharmacy and just deadpan in the city. And he would turn to me and go, are you not gonna pay for all the things in your purse? And I would just start shivering like a shelter to Owl. I would just end up paying for lipstick that I've owned for five years. I was like, just take my money. I'm so sorry. I hate this. I was traumatizing. By far, the most embarrassing thing he would do, he would do with his bodyguard. We traveled with this seven-foot tall guy named Kenny. Picture Frankenstein with less people skills. Just an oaf. And I don't know if you women have ever ordered anything on VictoriaSecret.com, but sometimes you get that free tote bag with purchase. If you have even a shred of self-respect, you immediately throw it in the garbage, where it belongs. I used it as my day-to-day purse for seven years. I have no dignity. And so I said, VictoriaSecret and big letters on the sides. It's very obnoxious. And I would travel with this. So when we were on tour, we'd have to get to the airport at five in the morning. And you guys know how you look at the airport at 5am, right? Just greasy, disheveled, gross. So I'd look like that. I'd have this bag. And everybody's just quietly shuffling about the airport. And all of a sudden, his bodyguard would shout, VictoriaSecret model coming through. LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER And everybody, and I mean everybody, would stop and look at me wide-eyed and then go, LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Do you know how quickly your self-esteem goes in the toilet? When you can watch 100 people decide in half a second, no, she's not. Like, right. It's going to go walk into traffic now, thanks. LAUGHTER So I'm from Washington State originally, and they just passed this new legislation that is banning schools from continuing to use Native American mascots, which is great. And the high school I went to, our mascot was the Blackhawks. And it takes a linguistic specialist to tell the difference between somebody saying, Blackhawks? LAUGHTER And Blackhawks? And let me tell you, it was pretty wild growing up, going to football games, and watching a dozen cheerleaders shout to a stand of parents. We love Blackhawks, yes we do, we love Blackhawks, how about you? LAUGHTER And then watching everybody on the other team be like, what the fuck? LAUGHTER It's like the mating call of the Kardashians. LAUGHTER So I had my bachelor at party down in Vegas, and we went to the Magic Mike live show. Has anybody here been to the Magic Mike live show? Oh, we got a few. Oh, are you still wet? Hey! Girl, it is crazy what happens at the show. They brought it back during COVID, which surprised me because if we are concerned about droplets, women are gushing fluid at the show. Medically, it's a problem. OK, it changes the humidity in the room. Women with straight hair leave with curly hair. It's like a rainforest cafe in there. That air is thick. Three seas. But now that the show is back, you gotta go. Oh, it is the cream of the cock. Just... Chef's kiss. For two hours, these oiled up six packs just grind the stage, they sink to you, they liquid cream off your body, and then they bring some women on stage, and then they take your top off, and then they take your pants off, and then they fuck you. No, I'm kidding. I just want to see how far you guys are going, man. Did you hear how quiet it got here? Could you feel every woman just slowly leaning further forward, and then you see the... Pulling out her phone, checking flights to Vegas. A taxi. Were you like, was I in the bathroom when that happened? I missed that. No, they don't do that. That'd be pretty dope. Probably charge a lot more for tickets. But you do get a lot free of money. At the end of the show, they do bring some women on stage, and then they put you in harnesses, and they put one of the guys beneath you, and you get to ride the men into the sky, like free willy. They get you horneer than you've ever been in your entire life, and then they just set you loose. Back into the wild. Single dudes, if you were ever trying to fuck in Vegas, just go stand outside the magic mic exit. Like a catcher. Running out of there, holes open like a starfish. Ready to go. That's something TripAdvisor doesn't tell you, and that's what I'm here for. I'm like, your creepy uncle. Just helping you get laid. I would like to go back to the show, but not for anything, what ain't related, because there's usually two types of women that go. The host comes out and goes, all right ladies, make some noise if you're here for a bachelor at party. And there's a bunch of young 27-year-olds that are like, oh my god, penis is wet! And then the host goes, all right, now who here's celebrating a divorce? And it's just one table of women in their 40s, like, give me your dick. Oh my god. Thank you guys so much for coming out tonight, Dan Bow. We've been amazing. Thank you so much. Welcome back to PobMyCherry. Tell me what are the rules? Well, basically, shoot for the goal, throw in the middle, and spin, and you try to... Just spin it like as fast you can. I'm going... oh, I'm going, that way. You're going this way. Do you guys want to make a bet or something, like, try and make it more, like, high stakes? I'll buy you a drink of you, in sure, yeah? That's fair. Yeah, I'm 70, really close to that. See that thing, that's what she's doing. She's a bright, hate you. One, two, three, go. One, two, three, go. Go! I'm getting it! Come on, I'm not allowed to cuss you out. Cuss me out. Are you saying you're not allowed to? There's no rough here. Oh, you're... Thank you very much.

You know what I'm saying? This is one of the brothers I think in the future. Really, you're gonna see a lot of them. I think the kids gonna blow up, because he has his own style and very, very funny. So that helps. He's from Atlanta, but he lives in LA now. Yo, give it up for my man, Chris Tucker. Oh! Shup, man! This motherfucker! Pistol, man! I am! I'm a fucking mama callin' me for Christmas.

Police arrest me, man, look man, I know I robbed that motherfucker stole my stolen my goddamn car man. Damn. I'm sitting in jail with the motherfucker, didn't even know it.

You was robbing the stole? Fucked up, man. Now when I need money, I'll rob a motherfucker in the middle. I don't care, I rob a motherfucker. One time I'm instant again, rob my mama. I said, let me put your goddamn hands up, put them up. Give me a purse, give me a purse. What you doing my brother's pictures in your pocket book? Chris, over there, I'm sorry, Dan. Chris, I'm gonna walk you down that dog street man. Do you like that shit going on my day? She gonna take me to court. I'm gonna get your purse back there. And I hate robbing motherfuckers. I gotta get friends with cause I don't have a cause. Hate waiting no motherfuckers, man. I hate waiting on people. You ever had somebody call you, tell you they own that way.

Now, I asked you the time I bring my man up stage, Russell Simmons, come on up here, man of public. Fuck you, me. Thank you for coming out. God bless you, good night. Thank you.

 Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Liss. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Thank you. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Wow. Wow. Thank you. That was way too much. I feel like... I feel like everyone's aware that that was too much. There was definitely a moment where collectively, everyone was like, I think we're overdoing it. A little bit... I appreciate it. That was nice. Some of you I felt like that was more about you than it was me, to be honest. I felt like a couple of you were like, I'm going to be the guy. I'm going to... They're going to hear me. At least four of you are like, I can't wait to watch this, because I'm going to point out my voice going, hey! That's fair. Good to be here. In New York, I said it like I'm visiting. I live here. It's nice to live here. I travel all the time every week. I hate flying. I get very anxious when I fly. I'm not afraid of a crash. I'm afraid of a conversation. That's what I hate about flying. I was on a plane the other day. The guy next to me was like, what do you do? And I was like, I mind my own business on airplanes. That's something. First of all, you're sitting too close together to have a conversation. The guy's trying to make eye contact. We're just staring at each other from this distance. I'm like, I can kiss you without using a neck muscle. That's how close you are. I was on a plane the other day. The guy next to me was eating a lollipop. Don't you think that's an inappropriate airplane food? A lollipop? It's too noisy. He's like, pfft. I was like, sir, you're turning me on. Could you relax a little bit? They don't even sell lollipops at the airport. That's a from-home lollipop. That guy got a lollipop. He's like, I'm gonna hold onto this until I fly. I want to make sure I have that three inches from somebody's ear. I don't even know where you get a lollipop, by the way. Outside of a bank and a doctor's office, they don't sell them, do they? If you give me $10 right now and you were like, go get me a lollipop. I would come back a week from now with my shirt torn and be like, I couldn't do it. I hate everybody on every plane. We all hate each other, though. That's not exclusive to me. We all hate each other. You know we're gonna hate each other on the airplane? Because as you're boarding the airplane, everyone just stares at you, dead in the face, angrily, the whole flight just... That's the only time it's a society. We're not looking at our phone. Everyone's like, let's put our phones away and look upset at everybody else on this airplane. I hate it, but I do it too. I'm just as guilty. As soon as I sit down, I'm like, look at this fucking idiot getting on the plane. What? Back there. It doesn't matter where you are on the plane. You feel better than everybody behind you, don't you? You could be in the second to last row. There's one guy behind you. You're like, what a fucking idiot back there. Barsing, loser. Last row. I was on a plane the other day. I hated the guy behind me. He kept yawning, out loud, the whole flight. Am I a psycho or is that annoying? The whole flight is like, mmm. For like five hours. Mmm. I wanted him to die. I swear to God. I was like, I hope this guy passes away on the flight. First of all, you don't need to make a noise when you're young. That's a decision. He's deciding to do that. It's like if you were hungry on a plane, you were like, I'm hungry! Yeah, yeah, I'm hungry. I like life people know when I'm hungry. I think it's important for people to know that people you're on on love. They want attention. That's why they're doing it. They want you to be like, oh my god, are you tired? They're like, I am. Here's my entire life story. I thought it came to be tired. Don't fall for it. It's a trap. Plus, isn't it fun to not ask somebody a question when they really want you to ask them a question? You ever do that when someone was like, I had a wild night last night and then you're like, neat. And then you just walk away. That's like one of my favorite things to do. Just tell me your shitty story. Don't make me ask for it. I flew recently out at the airport, La Guadilla Airport here in New York. That's my home airport. I was walking through the terminal. They were playing Welcome to the Jungle by Guns and Roses at the airport. That's a weird airport song. I'm a rock and roll guy. I love Guns and Roses. I'm cool. I walk through the terminal. I just hear, get it down. Get it down. Oh, like, can we cool it down a little bit? It's 7.30 a.m. I'm eating a muffin and looking for an outlet. I don't think we need to rock this hard. Also, it's a little unnerving to be boarding a flight and here, you're going to die! Like, shit, am I? Does they play knocking on heaven's door next? They're never flying again. I do fly every week, though. Pretty much literally every week. I got upgraded a lot. That's the nice thing about flying all the time. I got upgraded recently. My wife and I, both of us, like we have two tickets in first class, but they're not together. We'd have to separate you. Is that okay? And I was like, 100%. I feel like that one hurt your feelings. I love my wife. I'm joking. I love my wife. You're going to take first class. You can get it. They can be like, we have two tickets in first class. You have to get divorced to have them. I would be like, maybe we had a great run. I love it. Come on. Let's get comfy. It was cross-country first class, though. That's the real deal, shit. That's where your seat turns into a bed. It is weird to get separated from your wife on one of those. Because they put me with like a random fat guy. I don't know, make a fun of her being fat. Because some of you are fat. But he was so fat. He was coming into my seat. Like, we were flush shoulder to shoulder. And then we slowly ease back into bed together. And then we chose the same movie. And I was like, this is the most romantic day I've ever been on. I'm like, if this guy makes a move, I'll bang him right here. I don't give a shit. We got blankets, turbulence. When Harry met Sally's on, it's nice, you know? At one point on the flight, I got up. I looked over my wife had her own guy that she was in bed with. And then he was like the hottest guy on the plane. And that pissed me off. Because I was like, I want that guy. Switch guys. You take this piece of shit. I want the hot guy. I paid for these tickets. I like watching movies on the plane. We all do that, right? I like Delta. I fly Delta. Delta is the best airline. They have the best movies on Delta. I don't know who they are. They're the best movies on Delta. I'm not sure if they're the best movies on Delta. I don't know who categorizes the movies that Delta. I don't think they're doing a great job. I was on a flight the other day. I went to the classic section and the hangover part two. It was under classics. I swear to God, it was Tequila Mockingbird. It's a wonderful life. And the hangover part two. Classic. I remember the first time I saw the hangover part two. My grandfather showed it to me. It was on Turner Classic Movies. And we watched it on his black and white TV. Really fond of it. That wasn't the most egregious stuff. The most ridiculous one. I went to this is true. You can check my Instagram account. I went to documentary and the movie, A Quiet Place, was under documentaries. I don't know if you remember that movie. That was a summer blockbuster horror movie where monsters kill you if you make a sound. Somebody at Delta watched that movie was like, this is an amazing documentary. Holy shit. How did I not read about this in the papers? I'm glad somebody documented this. I'll say what I need to do to the low. I'll apply a lot of you guys to do this. I like to download a movie. Bring a laptop on the flight. Download a movie. Then you can just choose any movie you want. But you can use some discretion. Because ever around, you can see the movie you're watching. So you don't want to get too weird with it. What time I brought the movie? Casino. You guys all remember that movie. Great movie. From the 90s, Scorsese. Very violent. If you haven't seen the movie, at one point in the movie, a guy has his head crushed in a vice and his eyeball pops out. I looked over. There was a seven-year-old child staring at my laptop. He looked horrified. I felt so bad. I was like, you know what? Take an earbud. It'd be better with sound. If you could hear it. Then he started crying. I was like, are you ratting me out right now? I'll crush your little head in this laptop computer if I have to. I was on a plane one time. The lady next to me, she was watching 50 Shades of Grey on her laptop. Did you guys say that movie? Great documentary. It's a classic and a documentary, really. Very sexual film. I thought she was watching porn at first. I was like, good for you, lady. Get after it. Enjoy yourself. The flight attendant came by. She's like, would you like more pretzels? I was like, more napkins. If you don't mind. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. Well, I'm back. Okay. I'll be back. I'll be back. We got to work on this. Beautiful night. We've got to work on our mind. We don't mind. I'll be back. I wasn't expecting to see tits on the plane. I kind of caught me off-guard. We were landing. Could you put your tray table up? I'm like, I'd rather not write this moment. Emma. I can't sleep on the plane. Even with first class, I can't sleep on an airplane. I don't know about you guys. My friend's like, why can't you sleep on an airplane? He actually, I'm crazy. He's like, why don't you just go to sleep? I'm like, I can't. And he's like, why? I'm like, is that hard to understand? That's not a normal sleeping situation. That's why. Like, if you went home tonight and you went to bed and there was a jet engine idling outside of your bedroom window, don't you think you might be like, I'm gonna have trouble sleeping tonight? Because of the jet engine outside of my bedroom window. And then also, some are replaced your bed with a chair. And there was 71 strangers in your bedroom with you. And then someone woke you up in the middle of the night to offer you a Coke. That's what they do on an airplane. He's like, I know you're trying to sleep, but do you want a Coke right now? I'm like, yeah, yeah, give me a Coke. I like to break up my sleep with a can of Coke. That's how I sleep at home. I sleep for four hours. I wake up, I drink a can of Coke. Kind of spice up my dreams a little bit. Sometimes I boil Coke right before bed. A little sleepy time Pepsi. I love Coke. I had a quick Coke. I quit Coke. I still do blow, obviously. You've got to live your life, you know. Coke is bad for you. I just drink it all the time. People would always tell me it's bad. People love to do that. My friend, people would always say, Coke could take the paint off your car. What does that tell you? I'm like, it tells me not to put it on my car. That's what I... I'm not putting it on my car. I'm putting it in my body. And I don't have any paint in my body. If I did have paint in my body, I would want to get rid of it. So if you think about it that way, Coke's actually a pretty healthy beverage. You don't want paint in your body. If your kid actually swallows some paint, give him a can of Coke. Send him back out there. He'll be fine. It's very healthy. My buddy tried to help me sleep on the plane. He's like, you know, I borrow my sleep mask for your flight? I'm like, I don't. First of all, I don't need a sleep mask. I have a built-in sleep mask called eyelids. My eyelids block out the light for me. Also, it's not the lighting. It's the farts and the announcements. It's what I'm having a hard time with. You don't need a mask to sleep. Those words don't even go together. Sleep mask. That's like a masturbation helmet. It doesn't. They don't go together. Honey, have you seen my masturbation helmet and my bowel movement knee pads? They were with my sleep mask earlier. Now I can't find any of them. I've trouble sleeping at home, too, because I have anxiety. My same friend, he tried to help me with that. He goes, the key to falling asleep, he goes, you want to keep your body temperature cool. That's OK, that makes sense. And he said, one way to do that, you can wear socks and gloves to bed. It'll draw heat to those areas and cool the rest of your body. That's like nice. I might try that. Or I might flick on the air conditioning. That might be another thing. I'll either wear socks and gloves to bed, like I escaped from an asylum. But perhaps I'll turn on the ceiling fan. I might even stick my leg out from underneath the blankets. That's another way people have been cooling down for several centuries. Good advice, though. I might do that in the summer. Some are time, you know. I'll go down to the beach on a hot day and wear a couple of oven mitts and some tube socks. Kind of cool down my torso. You know how a lot of times people wear gloves to keep their nipples cool. Good advice. I tried to get healthy. I quit drinking a long time ago, a few years ago, you know. Sometimes, oh, thank you. I don't know if there's a boo. That's usually a sign that you're an alcoholic, by the way. If you hear someone, I'd be like, I quit drinking. It's always like, boo. I was getting too wild. Sometimes you get too wild when you're drinking, you know. Sometimes I think there's like placebo effect to drinking a little bit. Do you see like a person they're acting like an asshole? They're like, it's the whiskey talking. And then you're like, that's a spear and a feist. And it's your first one. So I feel like it's your personality talking, actually. I think there's some placebo effect to alcohol. Because I haven't had a drink in years, but I had a cold recently. So I went to a health food store and I got a shot of wheat grass. I don't even know what wheat grass is. But they put it in a shot glass and I fired it back and I was like, who wants to see my dick? I kicked over a table. I was like, sorry, that was muscle memory. I haven't drank anything. One and a half ounces at a time in a while. I got fired up. I apologize. Give me some vitamins. I want to store them up. But it's hard to be healthy. It's hard for everyone. I'm like on the road all the time of traveling. So it's like, sometimes I eat McDonald's because the only thing open and also because it's my favorite restaurant. So I was at McDonald's the other day. I was dining in. It's funny, right? That's the term they use. You order your food like, will you be dining in? I'm like, I'll be eating over there. I feel like dining feels a little dramatic. I'm going to chew my food in the corner as fast as I possibly can in the hopes that nobody sees me. I'm not going to cut my burger in half and put a cloth knack into my shirt and light a candle. But I was. I was dining in. And the phone rang while I was at McDonald's. That blew my mind. You guys don't even seem weird enough about that. Not my phone. Their phone. Somebody called McDonald's on the telephone. A human being was at their house and was like, you know, we need to call McDonald's. Let me get them on the phone. I didn't even know they had a phone. The employees didn't know. They were like, what the hell is that sound? We have a phone. What? Who calls McDonald's? I'm like, what are you making reservations? That must have been the breathiest phone call of all time. Just, oh, are there new toys in yet? I asked the lady. I was like, what was that phone call about? She was like, it was somebody complaining about the food. That blew my mind even more. I didn't know we could complain about McDonald's. It's shit food. You bought. That's a gamble. I can go to McDonald's. My burger could be bleeding. I'd be like, that's hilarious. You guys are crazy. Let's get out of here. Not to complain to a McDonald's employee. Excuse me, my meal wasn't great. Yeah, my fucking life isn't great. Are you shitting me? Go to a real restaurant, asshole. I don't care. You can complain to McDonald's, I think. If they get your meal wrong, that's like one thing. You get your meal in the right way, you know. But even that's not great. You could be like, excuse me, you put pickles on this? I don't really like pickles. And what they do for you, they'll take the pickles off and they eat them while making eye contact with you. And they slide your burger back to you. I had a complaint recently in McDonald's, but I didn't complain because I'm a good American. God damn it. This is my complaint. I went to McDonald's and I ordered my meal. My meal came to $9.89, and I paid with a $10 bill. My change is 11 cents, and the woman went, do you need your 11 cents or no? I thought that was weird. Once again, none of you were affected by this. I thought that was strange. I was like, well, I would like it. That belongs to me. So typically, you would just give that to me at this point in the transaction, but she was like, right. But do you need it? And I was like, I don't need it. No, I guess not. And then she was like, great, thank you. She took it out of the drawer, put it in her pocket, and just walked away. And I was like, what the fuck just happened to me? I just got robbed with my permission. That was very strange. It was like a Jedi McMindtric. It was like, you're going to need your 11 cents. I'm like, I guess I don't. Take it. I ate a lot of fast food. I ate Chipotle a lot. That's like my go-to. Thank you. Chipotle, I live here in New York. Now, when you go to fast food restaurants in New York City, they have like a secret code on the bathroom door. Because like, if you don't have a secret code in New York, people will move into your bathroom. They're like, this is our apartment now. But I don't know if you know this. When you go to the middle of the country, people that want to live in the Chipotle bathroom. So there's no code on the bathroom door, which is confusing to us New Yorkers. I was in like rural Illinois recently, and I went to a Chipotle, and I watched it for the counter. And I was like, hey, what is the bathroom code? And the guy had no idea what I was talking about. He was like, number one, urine, number two, shit. Is that the code you're asking me for? I was like, no, I know that code, of course. That's the most popular bathroom code, of course. Number one, P, number two, poo. We all know that. That's international. That's all over the world. There should be a statue or a plaque to whoever came up with the number one, number two, system. I googled it for like three straight days. I couldn't get to the bottom of who came up with it. I think this though. I think it was a woman. I think a woman came up with it because I think women like to let you know when they have to go number two, but they don't want to say anything, because it's not socially acceptable. Like my wife, she lets me know when she has to go number two. She telegraphs it slightly. This is what she does. She scrunches up her body, and then she whispers. She goes, I have to go the bathroom. And I'm like, did you date a guy that hit you when you shit? Why do you look afraid of me right now? Baby, I love you. Get in there. Let it rip. Am I putting on an anti-bombo movement vibe? I'm pro shitting. We can make out why you're doing it. I like it. I'm not into shitting, but you got to get it out there. I'm cool with the bathroom. I have no bathroom issue. I have one bathroom issue. But this is only, I think only men deal with this. At some point, men reach an age where at some point they start taking their penis out several feet before they arrive at a urinal or stall. I don't like that. I don't know when that starts happening. Every once in a while, I'm in a public restaurant. You just see a guy like, I'm going to take a piss. I'm like, dude, you got to leave earlier or get less complicated pants. Something's going wrong. It's not like taking your keys out before you get to your car. It's a freds of it. I think that's just men, by the way. I don't go to ladies room. But I don't picture women like heads up, Barbara. I have too many coffees. Whoa. Sue. Great lady. I've got it. Anyways, I'm trying to eat healthier. It's hard. I tried to go vegetarian for like a week. I was like, let me go one week, detox vegetarian. I didn't, I tried. I didn't do great. I went five days. I ate spaghetti-os, M&M's, and fruit loaps exclusively for five straight days. And I was like, I feel like shit. My teeth hurt. It's diet sucked. I broke the diet by accident. Day six, I ordered spaghetti and meatballs at a restaurant. I swear to God, this is true. I'm an idiot. I was halfway through before I was like, you know what? I think there might be meat in meatballs. I'm going to, let me just double check on this. I was like, why didn't you guys not put meat in your meatballs? You do. There are balls of meat. Okay, that's correct. Thank you. Did me fruit loaps my any chance? I want to... I want to be healthy. I feel like I'm relatively healthy. I went to the doctor recently. I can afford to go to the doctor now. I still don't have health insurance, but I can afford a visit. This is where I'm at financially. I'm not rich, but here's where I'm at. I had a big milestone recently. This is my point in life. If I pay for something with a debit card and it doesn't go through, I say, run it again. That's like a big moment in your life. Most of my life is like, that didn't go through. That makes perfect sense. I'll get the hell out of here. I apologize. I hate myself. I'm going to move back over to my parents. Don't call the cops. But now I'm like, no way. That's on you. I got 300 bones in there. I went to the doctor. It's nice to go to the doctor. I went to the ear doctor. Most people don't go to the ear doctor. In fact, so few people go to the ear doctor, they had to combine forces with the nose and throat doctor. That's one doctor. Ear nose throat. That's the only doctor that combines body parts. There's no doctor. It's like, I'll put pussy forehead. Those are my three areas. Oh, man. It's like, yeah, those are my three favorites. So I just studied those. And now I'm, you know, nice. That's awesome. So I went to the ear nose throat doctor, which is a cool doctor. It's one doctor. He knows all three body parts. I was hoping it was three doctors saving money by sharing a small office. He's like, I'm Bill. This is Susan and Ted. Ear nose throat. Who do you need? I went from my ear. I have an ear issue called Tinnitus or Tinnitus. That's when your ear is ring. You got it? Yeah. It's frustrating. When your ear is ring or buzz all the time. I don't know how you say it. I thought it was called Tinnitus. But then I watched a YouTube video and the doctor on the video, he kept saying Tinnitus. And so then I was like, oh, I guess it's pronounced Tinnitus. But I went to the comment section and the first comment said, this guy's a fake ass fucking retard doctor. It's pronounced Tannitus. All caps. I thought it was like, shit. Now I don't know how to say this word. This gentleman's a doctor. He seems very smart. This fella seems less smart, but extremely adamant about the pronunciation of this word. Tomato tomato. However you say it, if you haven't, don't go to the doctor. They don't do shit. I went to the doctor. I was like, doc, I have a Tinnitus or Tinnitus, whatever you guys are calling it. My ears are ringing. And then he said, okay, I'm going to test your hearing. And I was like, oh, no, that's okay. My hearing is great. I hear everything plus ringing. So I kind of have super power hearing. If you think about it, I'm hearing, so that's not even in the room. He gave me the hearing test. I passed it, nailed it. Great hearing. Then he said, I'm going to look in your ears to make sure it's nothing obvious. I thought that was kind of hilarious, because he didn't explain what obvious would be. Like, he's going to look in my ear and be like, oh, there's a tiny alarm clock in your ear canal. That's a very rare condition. I'm going to reach in there, hit the snooze for you. It'll be fine for like nine minutes, but he looked in my ear. It was nothing obvious. So then he was out of things. He's like, well, you're hearing is great, and there's nothing obvious causing the problem. Then he said this, he goes, you have an over-bite. You might have something to do with your over-bite. That was it. No science, no confidence. He just picked out a thing I'm physically self-conscious about. I was like, maybe that? Could be your small dick also. I don't know. You know, there were a lot of problems. You were very unattractive. I was like, who's this? I'm fair. I felt insulted. I always feel insulted in the doctor. Don't you feel so vulnerable at the doctor? Everything he says. He tried to explain to me. He's like, you have tiny little hairs in your ear. And I was like, you have big hairs in your nose. Asshole. What do you leave me alone? You bully? He said, he was like, I recommend getting a white noise machine. And I was like, you're a white noise machine. I was like, what does a white noise machine do? He goes, well, that way you're hearing the white noise instead of the sound that you're hearing. And I was like, right, the sound of hearing is white noise. I have a white noise machine in my head. That's the issue. You're telling me to get surround sound of the problem of telling you I have. I feel like if you had a bad smell in your nose and you went to the doctor and he was like, put a little dog shit on your lip. Just every morning, scoop a little dog shit on your upper lip. That's what I would do. That way you're smelling dog shit. That'll be $8,000. We don't take any insurance. God bless America. I went to the dentist. I've been going to the dentist a lot. I didn't go to the dentist for like 10 years. Don't skip years. I thought you could just skip over those years. But they make you make up for the time you missed. I hate the dentist. I love my dentist personally. Like, he's a good guy where friends, I love him. But the dentist of the doctor, I trust the least. I think they're just making it shit up. I feel like those are completely made up by the dental industry. Nobody's on board with this. But the dentist is like, you have a cavity. And I was like, do I? It doesn't hurt. He's like, cavities don't always hurt. And I was like, I don't see anything. And he's like, you can't really see cavities. I was like, this is awfully convenient for you, isn't it? It doesn't hurt. And I can't see it. But you need to fix it. That's a little suspicious if you ask me. He's like, you can ignore it. But I'll turn you a root canal. And I was like, now I feel like you're threatening me. I think you're making shit up. And you're threatening me with it. And I was like, whatever, fill it, I guess. He filled the cavity. I think he filled it. I have no idea. They numb your mouth. You can't feel what they're doing. And you can't see what they're doing. So he might have been crocheting. I have no idea what this guy did. But he charged me 500 bucks, which seemed high. And then I went back six months later. You got to go every six months. And this time I needed a root canal. Different tooth. Wasn't even hurting. He's like, you need a root canal. And I was like, which tooth? He's like, which one you want? Just pick a tooth. That's what I make some extra cash for the holidays. I was like, are you sure I need a root canal? He's like, oh, yeah. He showed me the X-ray. Doctors love to show you the X-ray. As though you've read an X-ray. At any point in your entire life, he tosses it up there. He's like, take a look. I'm like, I don't know what that is. I read books and tweets almost exclusively. And he's like, see how it's all white right here? And I'm like, well, it's a black and white photo. So the whole goddamn photo is white. I was like, I can't afford a root canal. I was like, one of those like $3,000. He goes, they're not $3,000. He said, like, it was an idiot. He's like, they're not $3,000. And I'm like, all right, well, I'm not a dentist. And you don't have a menu with prices on it, okay? I was like, how much did they cost? He said $1,800. Which is a little frustrating. Because I feel like I was in the ballpark. It's like I said $75,000. I was pretty close. They did the root canal, which was fine. And then afterwards, he's like, now you need a crown. And I was like, how much did the crown cost? And with a straight face, he said $1,200. I swear to God, that's not even a joke at all. I was like, what? I'm sorry, that sounds an awful lot, like $3,000. You could have at least given me the satisfaction of nailing it. I should get both prizes, forgetting the... Have you guys had root canal, they're a bummer. They're not that bad. I've had like nine in the last three weeks, but... They're hooks in me. They're not that bad. They numb your mouth, like I said. So it doesn't hurt, but this is what they do. They drill into your tooth. I won't get to grab it. They drill into your tooth, and they just pull the roots out. They toss them or plant them. I don't know what they're doing with the roots. They collect them. Then they do. But they do it. They whittle your tooth down. They're like a little piece of shit nub. And then they glue a fake tooth on top of that. And then they go like this. We saved it. We saved your tooth. Like you did. You saved it. You did quite a bit of damage right before you saved it. Most of my tooth is on my glasses right now, but... You fixed it up new. I'd be like, if I had to get a haircut and they just shaved your head and gave you a wig and they're like, we fixed it. It looks a lot better. It looked ridiculous for a minute there. That'll be 18 hundo for the haircut. And 1200 for the wig. It's a packaged deal. I don't know what's the eye doctor. I got an eye exam. How did you get an eye exam for like 10 years? Do you know why I didn't get an eye exam for 10 years? Because I was basically off dental prices. I thought I couldn't afford an eye exam. It was like it cost me $3,500 to fix two teeth. That weren't even bothering me. What the hell is eyesight going to cost? $75. That's so much an eye exam cost in New York City. $75. I showed up with $5,000 in my pocket. I walked in there with all my money. I was like, just let me see again. I'll give you the rest when I have it. They're like, that'll be $75. I'm like, are you shitting me? Give me two eye exams. Double check both eyes. I'll pay for that. I'll pay for everybody's eye exams all day. I'm like, daddy war bucks in here. I don't think eye doctors have any idea how much dentists are charging out there. They could really up their prices if they wanted to. That's not maybe like eye doctors, like the lowest self esteem doctor. They're like, can you read the bottom line? It's fine if you can't. I can't either. I'm a fucking idiot. Stupid. My dad hates me. He's like, geez. You alright? Our teeth more expensive than eyes. That's like unbelievable to me. You have so many more teeth. If you lose a tooth, nobody even notices. If you lose an eye, you have a new nickname. People notice. If you lose an eye, your friends are going to be like, didn't you use to have multiple eyes? You did, you had two. I thought you had two. Plus teeth is other options too. If you can't afford a root canal, they can pull the tooth for you. It takes like three minutes. It's fairly cheap. They don't have that at the eye doctor. You know? You're like, I can't read the bottom line. You're like, once the pull that out, we can toss that thing right away for you. We'll give you some gauze and some vikin' in. Don't need anything solid for a couple days. I'm going to therapy. You guys going to therapy out there? Mental indental. No, not a big therapy. New York too. I love it. I can do it for you. If you guys wanted to go, maybe you can't afford it. I can do it for you. I didn't go to college or anything. But I know how to do therapy. I've been going long enough. Whatever you're dealing with, it's because of your family. Look no further than your own family. That's all therapy is. You complain about your problems than they says. It's your family. And then you're like, I don't know. And then I spent 11 seconds with my family. And I was like, he nailed it. These little worst people I've ever met in my life. I don't know how I didn't see this earlier. My aunt Betty, she's a big source of my anxiety. I don't know if you guys know her at all. She was a babysitter. Late in the 80s, early 90s. I have anxiety. That's like my biggest issue. I know what my anxiety began. I think it was because of my aunt Betty. When I was eight years old, this is a true story. My aunt Betty, when I was eight years old, this is a true story. My aunt Betty said this to me. She said, Joe, my biggest fear. Tell me her biggest fear. I didn't ask what her biggest fear was because I was eight years old. I did not give a shit about her fears. But she told me anyway. She said, my biggest fear is that when I go to the bathroom, there'll be a man hiding behind the shower curtain waiting to get me. And I was like, well, that's my biggest fear now. Also. Previously, my biggest fear had been wedding my pants. But that's now the solution to avoiding my new biggest fear. Entering the bathroom at my parents house. My parents were like, what do you want for your ninth birthday? I'm like, how about a year and a half in my bedroom? And maybe a firearm in a new babysitter, the big three. Now, it was my big fear when I was a kid, wedding my pants. Did you get like frightened of anything or scared, which I was scared of everything? If you get frightened by something, you could just urinate right in your pants. And then your life is ruined. That's a weird mind-body connection. I never understood. Like your brain is like, I'm terrified. And then your bladder is like, we'll go ahead and piss it in. And then your brain is like, that didn't help at all. And your bladder is like, that's all we know how to do. We just want to let you know we're helping. And then your colon's like, we're ready to rock also. If you want us to fire something up. Fortunately, my aunt Betty was never attacked by a man behind the shower curtain, which is good. I think it still happens. She's still alive. It probably won't. She lives with her parents. They have a security system set up. She's always lived with her parents. She's never moved out. She's never been married. She had the wrong worst fear. She should have been praying for a man behind that shower curtain. She might have been held a scooch on out of that house. But that joke got me evidently. But she's an asshole in real life. Don't worry about it. You guys really took her side. That hurt my feelings. God damn it. What about my feelings? I'll say what's good about therapy. You're going to diagnosis. You find out what's going on. Like what's wrong? You know, like we're all fucked up. You know, you go to therapy. You're going to diagnosis. Like I have OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder, which is fun. I like to say I have it. Some people word it differently. Some people will say this. I am OCD. You remember me? Those people? Like I got to go wash my hands. I'm OCD. That triggers my OCD. Because I'm like you're not saying it properly. I guess it sounds normal. Because you hear it. So it sounds normal. But watch me replace it with something else. I got to go wash my hands. I'm genital herpes. See how that... I'm sorry. You have genital herpes. It's who I am. Call me Jen for sure. It's very serious. I'm trying to relax more. It's hard. I got into Buddhism. I'm like a Buddhist sort of. I read a Buddhist book. It wasn't a book. It was a meme. If I'm being honest with you guys, but... I like to say book. You sound smarter when you say you read a book. But memes are more... they're preferable. They're more succinct. This is what I said. And I said, let negative thoughts come into your head. But don't serve them tea. Mm-hmm. Because you don't want your negative thoughts lingering around drinking tea. That's like the analogy, I guess. My negative thoughts aren't drinking tea. Mine are doing cocaine. That's a better analogy. My negative thoughts are like, climate change is going to make the world uninhabitable. Tomorrow! Oh, fuck. Jesus. I read this. Human beings have up to 70,000 thoughts a day. Did you guys know that? I thought it was like nine. I had no idea. 70,000 is too many. I don't think I have 70,000 thoughts a day. I feel like I have four thoughts a day. They just repeat 70,000 times. My four thoughts are, my parents are going to die. I'm horny. Is that cancer? Is this funny? Those are the only four thoughts I ever have in my life. I've been traveling a lot. I was stressful to travel. I went to Israel last year. I don't know if you guys have been. New York. You probably have. I went to the Dead Sea. That's like a big attraction in Israel. You guys know about the Dead Sea. Even if you've never been, you're familiar. You can float. That's like the big attraction to the Dead Sea. You float. I don't know if you guys know this. Did you know this? You can actually float in anybody of water. You do not have to travel to the Middle East if you'd like to float in water. You can do that right here in America. They don't know that over there. They're like, You're a water. You'll float. I'm like, we have chairs that float. They have little cup holders. We do it all summer. It's terrific. We got foam noodles. You can buy them for three bucks. But I went. I didn't want to go to them. But you're going to try new things. That's very important in life. That's what they say. I think new things are overrated, honestly. Once you get to a certain age, I'm 37. I like chicken parm and missionary sex. That's all I'm really into. People are like, what about Ville and reverse cowgirl? Those are inhumane. If you ask me, I'll let you go. I went to the Dead Sea. I had a tour guide. He gave me some fun facts with the Dead Sea. He said it's the lowest body of water on earth. I was like, oh, that's neat. Then he added a second part that I thought was annoying. He said, it's actually below sea level. I was like, I don't know if you're smarter than me or a dumber than me. But it's not below sea level. It is sea level. It's the sea. Whatever the level is, that's the sea level. You can't be below yourself. Maybe it's like, actually, you can't be. And I was like, maybe you should below yourself. I thought that was what I was. Right up the top of my head. That was pretty good. He didn't laugh at all. I think someone was watching translation. But I thought it was a good singer. Then he said this. He warned me. So when you get in the water, if you have any cuts or nicks or abrasions on your body, you're going to really feel it because the salt can get in there. And I was like, I don't have any cuts or nicks or abrasions on my body. So I'm not too worried about it. But then I got in the water. And you know, when I found out your pee hole qualifies as a cut, nick, or abrasion. I had no idea. All these years, I'm walking around with a cut on the end of my penis. Or a nick. My pee a dick, Nick. I'm not sure. I got in the water. I was like, ah! And then he was like, is your pee hole burning a little bit? And I was like, you fucking knew about this? You gave me that shitty snapple fact about the sea level. I failed to mention I might have a burning pee hole. It goes, it's normal. I'm like, no, it's not. That's abnormal. Normally, I have no burning in my penis while swimming. He's like, you'll get used to it. And I was like, I'm not going to get used to it. I'm going to get out of the water and go back to America. I'm not. I don't want to just have a burning dick. And be like, ooh, it's an acquired taste after a few minutes. I'm vigorating. Guys, if you want to experience the Dead Sea, go home tonight. Get a glass of water, fill it with salt, and then just ease down into the... I'm doing it. Get a sense of what the Dead Sea is about. Ladies, it's harder. It's harder to... It's harder to dip your vagina in a glass. But, gynas don't dangle, you know. Some do, but I feel like... I don't know if it happens with women, because I was with a friend of mine, Rachel. She's a woman. We got out of the water. And I was like, Rachel, my pee hole. Did your vagina burn at all? And she was like, I only went in knee deep. And I was like, oh, me too. Thank you. It was the proudest moment of my comedy career. I went to Ireland last year. Been there a couple of times. That's a beautiful country. They like to fight there. That's like a big stereotype, fighting Irish. I don't like stereotypes, but they nailed that one. I saw so many fights. I saw the biggest fight I've ever seen. A big brawl. It was two bouts. I was in Dublin. There was two boutsers from a bar fighting this one as a guy. And I think he was like a patriot. I don't know how the fight started. It was already in progress when I got there. They might have been fighting for centuries. But it was two on one. And the three of them, they just kicked the shit out of each other. Eventually the two guys beat up the one guy, because they had more arms than he had. That's a big advantage in a fight. They knocked the guy down. This would happen. They knocked the guy down, finally. And they didn't hit him while he was down. They just kind of stood there, like we've won the fight. And I was really, I was like, I respect that. Because here in America, if you get in a fight and you get a guy down, you kick him until he dies. You know what I mean? We're number one, goddammit. I'm from Boston. Maybe you guys are. But I mean, that missed the... But he didn't kick him. He didn't hit him all. He just kind of stood there. And then I was like, these guys are real gentlemen. They don't hit him man when he's down. But then plot twist. The guy, he was laying on the ground. His girlfriend came running over. And she was like, you sons of bitches. And one of the guys blasted her right in the face. And I was like, wow, I seem to have jumped the gun. I'm my assessment of these fellas. Not quite as gentlemanly as I first suspected. Won't hit a man when he's down. We'll hit a woman when she's up. So... I was like, I better do something, goddammit. I'm an American. I'm gonna take action. So I did. I tweeted. I was like, I just saw some crazy shit. Hashtag blessed. Fire it off. Hit him where it hurts. The lady was fine by the way. She was an inch. I would not make a joke if she was hurt. She was completely fine. I think she might have been on meth. I think that, because I read there's a meth problem in Dublin. And then when the woman got punched in the face, she went like this. Haaaaaaaaaaa! And I was like, I think that might be one of those meth people I was reading about. That seems like a methie reaction to a punch in the face. And by the way, she won the fight. Both guys were like, oh shit, that's crazy. They kind of left. And then she was crying. And then she kind of hugged her man. He was bleeding in the street. They kind of hugged. And for a moment, I got kind of jealous. I was like, my wife and I never do fun stuff like this anymore. That's really sweet, you know? Then this part, you're going to think I'm making this up. But I swear to God, this really happened. The woman, she walked over to the bar. She opened the front door of the bar, and she yelled inside. She went, all we wanted was some chips. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I was like. I really wish I saw the beginning of this fight, because... I feel like there has to be more to that story. There's no way. Like that woman was sitting at the bar. She was like, can we get some chips right over here? Take them outside. Beat the shit out of him. And punch her right in the fucking face. We do not sell chips at this establishment. The rest of my time in Ireland is like, can I get some chips? But if not, no big deal. I don't want to cause a big... I know you're very particular about your chip distribution in this country. I understand you had a famine some time ago. I don't want to cause any problems. I do have a wife. We have sex. You guys having sex out there? You like that segue? You don't like about sex? I like sex. You keep learning. I've been having sex for a number of years. Sometimes I feel like it's a learning experience. Recently, my wife and I had sex. She had a cold. We had sex anyways. She's a real trooper. In the middle of the sex, she coughed and it ejected my penis out of her body. Did you guys know what that happens? Not a little bit. 100% out of her body. I was like, whoa, what? I was like a magic trick. I've been telling you that's one, two, all the way down. Ear knows throat vagina. It's MTV. I was like, I gotta get some cough drops or a bigger dick. Something has to change here. Ladies, do you know you can do that? Next time you're having sex with your man and he's not giving it to you the way you like it. Just give him a good... Ah! Don't come back here with that weak ass shit. I'll coffee right out of this relationship. I was nervous to get back in there. I'm like, if she sneezes, I'm gonna be dead on the ceiling over here. I got back in there. Back on the horse, as they say. The horse being my wife in this particular situation. She's more of a putty. She's very putty. I got in there. I was really holding onto that headboard because I was nervous. I thought she was having an orgasm at first. They sound similar. She's like, huh? For like one second, I was like, I'm fucking hitting it today. Yeah! That she sneezed and blew it in my face. I was like, oh, that makes more sense. Then I came and said, God bless you. That was kinda high. That's actually a better time to say God bless you, really. Sex is fun. I love it. Sex is different when you're married though. I'm a dirty guy. I like to get dirty and weird. I'm a dirty guy. When you're married, you can't get too dirty. You have to segue back into your regular life together. You know what I mean? When you're single, you can say crazy. You can do whatever. I can't ever see this person again. That was weird. When you're married. It's hard to be like, stuff in my balls and choke me, bitch. Then five minutes later, I'll do the dishes a few vacuums. Is that cool? Sorry. Sorry about earlier. I don't know what happened there. I did. That's why I go entry-level dirty talk. Just kinda regular, you know what I mean? Like the other day, we were having sex. I don't know why I get too graphic out of respect. But she was on top and I went, yeah, fuck me. That's something, right? Standard. And then she said, I am. I had to be like, no, I know. I know you are. It was more of a rhetorical. Then I tried to cough her off of me. I want to see if I can do it to her. Nothing to do it. I got to do some kegels or something. I love my wife. I love her family. She's a sister. We're buddies. I was hanging out with my wife's sister the other day. And you ever send a text message too quick? And you miss a letter or a word? It changes the whole text. We've all had that. I had that happen recently. I was hanging out with my sister in law. And my wife texted. And she wrote, how's things going with my sister? And I wrote back, great. She's a lot of fun. I wish you were her. That's a bad text. I meant to write, I wish you were here. Obviously. I felt bad. I had to call her. I was like, hey, I didn't mean to write that. I was distracted. I was trying to fuck your sister. But I got a little confused. But I wish you were here. So we can all fool around a little, you know? Like in the movies. It's weird when you date or marry someone with a sibling. Because siblings tend to look alike. Because they have the same parents. But you're supposed to be attracted to the sibling. Because it's inappropriate. But they look alike. You got to pretend they know. You got to be like, baby, you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in the whole world. But this younger version of you is very off-putting to me. I don't know. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. I would never be attracted to a slightly newer version of you. I don't... That's gross. I'm very attracted to my wife. Because you want to... I want her to be attracted to me. I don't know. It's hard. Because when you're married, you want the person to be attracted to you. I googled things that are sexy to women. And you shouldn't do that. That's a mistake. I read about 25 articles. I had none of the things in any of the articles. Which was a bummer. What things said making the bed is sexy? I make the bed. I feel like that's a bullshit article. That's just a woman trying to get guys to make her bed. I'm pretty sure. Like someone was like, put down making the bed. Let's see if they try that. Her editor's like, that's not really sexy. She's like, I know. Let's get our beds made. If nothing else, these guys are idiots. I don't picture a woman being like, ooh, look at the way he snaps out the wrinkles. That's so hot. Somethings I think should be sexy to women, but they're not. Like I don't understand women. Like the other day, I was putting my socks on and my foot just ripped right through it. I was like, whoosh. I turned to my wife. I'm like, ah. You want a bag or what? She's like, what are you talking about? I'm like, I'm too much man. That's what I'm talking about. Goddamn socks. Can't even contain me anymore. She's like, no, you have a hole in the toe. Oh my god, whatever it is. Sometimes it's confusing what sexy is. My wife and I, one time we were watching broke back mountain together and she got turned on, not by the sex. There's a scene in the movie. I don't know if you saw the movie. I won't give anything away. In case you've been waiting 17 years to watch this masterpiece. We're watching the movie. There's a scene in the movie where Jake Gyllenhaal's character. He yells at his father-in-law. He says, sit your ass down. You old son of a bitch. It's like a big scene in the movie. And then my wife was like, ooh, that was hot. I was like, is that hot? Should I be yelling at your dad? Is that... Is that a turn on? That never even crossed my mind. I wake up every morning. I do 100 push-ups and I make the bed. I never thought to reprimand your father. I am to please, though. We're going to visit her parents or dads. I'm going to take my princess out of the room. I was like, that's what you think. You fat fuck. It was like, what is wrong with you? I'm like, I don't know. What's wrong with her? That's the real question. You raised this weirdo. I'm trying to stay sexually relevant. I would love a nice cream. That's not what she's into. So sit down. You son of a bitch. Didn't turn her out at all, by the way. Turned her mother on. She loved it. She was like, yeah, give it to him. Hit this dip shit. I think I have a chance with her mother. It feels inappropriate. You got to spice it up, though. We've been together a long time. You know, sex. You got to mix it up. I tell you what I like. I like shoes and bed. That's my thing. Anybody? I'm talking like, hi, heels. Not new balance or A6. It would be something nice. I like shoes and bed because they don't belong in bed. It's like a threesome. I'm not a fan of you, but stick around. I like what this is going, you know. That's the sex you look on a woman, by the way. Naked with shoes. Not a man. Man, we're not quite able to pull that look off, just yet. If I'm naked wearing shoes, I look like a toddler that ran away from his mother while she was changing him. You ever seen that when so much change in the kid? And the kid makes a run forward. He's like, no! Tiny dick flipping everywhere. He hides in the curtain. That's me. I think it's when a woman is naked wearing shoes. It's kind of like she's like, I forgot to get dressed. A man naked with shoes is like, I forgot to take my medicine. I don't know what got into me. I'm sorry. I like morning sex. That's my favorite sex. Morning sex. First thing, right? Yeah, there you go. I love it. My wife doesn't like it. I'm like, let's have some morning sex. She's like, no, I want to start my day. Yeah, I want to start my day also. That's what I was referring to. Frankly, it's a little hurtful that you wouldn't consider that part of your day. That she's just eating cereal. I just got cock-blocked by Tony the Tiger. That's not a great feeling. I think the problem with morning sex, morning breath. That's the main problem. Morning breath. I'm pretty sure is how doggie style sex got invented. There was a couple having sex first thing in the morning, and then 30 seconds in, the woman's like, let's try this at my face, bury in the pillow. That'll be better. We can still do it. I'll just lift my genitals to you and hide my nostrils and we'll win. Thank you for making the bed, by the way. That's really nice of you. Thank you guys very much. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Thank you. Take care. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, gentlemen! Oh my god, let him hear it, everybody. Come on. You're welcome. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're here.

 What up, Mike Young here. Detroit Native, living in LA 16 years. Comedian, writer, director, directed two movies nobody really saw. That's okay, maybe I'll get to direct another one. Everybody in LA has got a film fun. Right now priority number one, get a new hour of material and do a special. That's all we want is comedians is a special. That's it. Right now I'm going on stage in 15 minutes. Fan, how you doing, man? Mike Young, I'm on it in 15. Just want to rest up. I'm going to check in right in front of me. Oh no, man, I'm a regular here. I'm on the wall between Sag and Kinnison. Mike Young. Who the fuck is Mike Young? Being single is exhausting. You got to be in physical shape, mental shape, verbal condition. You got to talk. It's fucking words everywhere. I got to get a girlfriend just so I could shut up again. I cannot wait to be quiet and competition is real out there in the streets. It's real. Guys are out there in tight shirts and hair gel everywhere. Me and this one guy were talking to the same girl. He tried to hit her with like an athletic achievement and a hand touch. I had to come back strong with a sensitive story and a back rub. I don't play games. Then he tried to come out with like a business I was going to make millions. I had to go right to a lie. I'm like my family invented the table. You ever heard of the table, bro? It's kind of a big item player. Yeah, I'm Mike Table. Google me. Walk away. Now it's over. Hi. Paul texted and wanted to know what time basketball was. And I think your mom called, but it just had home. Baby, you can't check my text. That's invasive. You're going to have sex with me, but I can't check your phone. Those two things have nothing to do with each other. They do to me. Don't worry, Mike. I'm not going to let me to you or anything. Oh my god. How could you even say something like that? We had a great night, a great consensual night. Two pillows each. Both slept great. I got you water twice in the middle of the night. Hot coffee in the morning. I love the songs. I cannot hear that song right now. I know you dated this girl by how. What do you mean how? You dated Caroline and you were reading glasses and you drive a Honda Accord. Honda Accord's motor trend car the year three years running. You have major trust issues. Didn't we talk about this last night? We just met last night. Two kinds of girls, over 30 under 30. There is a distinct difference. Over 30 they got their ship figured out. Yeah, they're here talking. They know what they want. If there's a one night stand, it was a one night stand for her too. She didn't want to be there either. She's a grown woman, bro. You got used. You got used. It happens. Every now and then you will get used. Here's a hint, fellas. Anytime everything you say works, it's not you. Just a little tip from single Mike. It's a grown woman. She will tuck you in like a child and leave with carry out. She doesn't care. You looked up, she was in your toaster oven making a chicken case idea. You didn't even know you had chicken. Not under 30. Oh, young girls, they'll stay for the weekend. They don't give a shit. Ah, they move right in. They don't leave. They act like their parents struck them off for a slumber party. It's 12 o'clock in the afternoon like what's for lunch? A taxi sandwich. You have to go. You don't live here burrito is what we're having today. All right, you're having an uber salad, uber salad. Well, young girls, they got so much energy too. Under 30, energy for days. All they wanted to, let's go to the after party. I'm exhausted. Is anybody tired? I'm not going to the after party unless they're soup. How good is soup? It's like you're already in bed. I love a good soup. If there's French onion soup, I'll eat you're pussy and call your uncle. It's the best soup I ever had. Who makes that soup? I'll eat the cheese and throw out the soup. I'll sleep in that soup. Under 30. They want a play fight. I'm a grown man. All right, don't put me in a headlock. You just pinched a nerve. That shit hurts. Yeah, now I'm hurt. I got a softball game Thursday. My team needs me. I'm a three time off star. You don't just put me out of the game. Punch me in the stomach. That's how Houdini died. You could kill somebody. You don't just punch people when they're not looking. Under 30. Even in bed, women get better as they get older. These younger girls are doing shit they see on the internet. I don't even know what these moves are. I can't keep up. I don't know your move. This girl is crawling on the edge of the bed. I was like, yo, did you lose your wallet? Where are you going? What are you doing in my hallway? This doesn't even make sense. None of this is fun for me. Come back. Fuck it. Get the mail. Let it come back. You work for me now. I don't know what these moves are. These young girls, but they grew up on internet porn. That's not real. All right, it's not real. You don't have to spit everywhere. Quit spitting. It's not a spit fest. You're drooling like a kid. All right, relax. Stop it. Over 30. They just got their shit together. You know what I mean? I'm not afraid to pull out toys in the bedroom. They'll pull them out right there. They don't care. I was with one girl. She had a whole droplet of shit. I panicked. Yeah, I was involved in a threesome. I was the only human being. I didn't know what to do. All right? I was in the corner with a remote control car. What am I even doing here? She had real toys. She said, let's do it again. I'm like, let me finish my Lego castle. It's a wrap, man. I'm done. The single life's going to kill me. Whoa, slow down, all right? You got to stay unsettled. I'll be the settled guy. If you settle down, then I don't have any stories. And I need them to live through. Any chance you're guys are going to get the money for my movie? Oh, yeah, it's a lot. I mean, these guys have to make $12,500,000 movies by the end of being here. I would love to be one of those movies. I know. Can they get me a friend pass on Raya? You verified? I don't even know what that means. Wow, then you got to be richer, famous. Is there a section for potential? No. Fuck, Raya. Who wants to go on a site with nothing but beautiful girls? My next relationship, I got a quick mistake and crazy for interesting. Every guy's done it. Oh, you're so spontaneous in full of life. This goes the life of the party. Look at her go six weeks in. Wow, you're bipolar. This is real shit. This is so real. You don't like me. I like all the different views. Bring back Sunday. Sunday just reads and relaxes. Tuesday will kill you on a Wednesday. I'm done with fast, explosive relationships. We've all had it though. You ever have one of those where you do everything in a week and you never talk again? Just doing all right away. We met. We fought. We had great sex. I got your brother a job. We never talked again. We did it all. I talked to my doctor. I got low T. It's real. You don't have low T, Bobby. You got a low T life. You got the perfect amount of T for your life. You're married to a great girl. You stay inside most of your life. You don't want my T. Give me the antler, Mike. I know you got it. I'm not giving you the antler, Bob. This is what kept Barry Barnes out of the hall of fame. Trust me. This is what pro athletes are on. So why are you on it? Because being single in LA is a pro sport. Give me the fucking antler, Mike. All right, Bob. Two squirts only on the tone. Mike popped in the three-point line and I'll kick it out. Guys, when I go down low, find me. I'm just in the shoe. Ah, don't shoot it. Got it. Bob, you all right? Press it on. Let me ask you a question. How does it feel to take someone's idea and just sell it to a studio and make a fucking fortune? And you don't even reach out? I should take your shaved head and shave it again. Because you know what? I can do any fucking thing I want, because that's what I can do. I didn't steal your idea, Bob. I was working on making an afraid for years before we even met. Hey, we had naked. You added a frayed and sold it. I'm your dentist, Bob. The show is a fluke. I just saw your wife in the office on Thursday. Yes, I know. She came home swollen, you muller, fucker. She looks like a sad, crying, blowfish. Married friends versus single. All right. Married friends do not have my immune system. You can't do what I do, OK? You got kids, your kid walks in, sneezes, your whole family's a mess for a month. I make out with a stripper on a Wednesday just to clear my sinuses. I'm like a walking Z-pack. I couldn't catch a cold if I wanted one. Couldn't catch. I'm getting older, but I'm staying young. I'm keeping it young. I'm in a softball league, hockey league, basketball league. Yeah, I can't even work. I got an 80 game season. I got no time to work right now. Are you crazy? Playoffs are coming. Don't fuck around. We got to get that championship this year. It's probably not going to happen. My team's 0 and 8. We're terrible. We're like the bad news bears before they went to rehab. I got a right fielder hooked on diet pills. He's just shaking in the outfield, pulled a hamstring without even moving. Ow. I got a center fielder so stoned. He's like, wow, who cuts all this grass? My first basement thinks he's good. He's horrible. I should be pitching. You should be home. You're terrible. And he brings this girl to every game. Why do you bring your girl when you're terrible? That's like the opposite of showing off, bro. She's going to fuck the shortstop by accident. Quit bringing your girl. I got that one guy best dressed, worst athlete. Don't you love him? Guys got $500 worth of shit I couldn't catch a beach ball. Looks amazing. Just comes out smooth. He gets the ball. Yeah. But you keep my other team because his dad owns a sporting good store. Got to get free shit. My captain's still yelling at us. You ever get yelled at as an adult on a team? It's a little uncomfortable. Where is your speed, Mike? In high school, Pete. Who am I kidding? I'm getting old. I'm pulling muscles doing nothing. You ever yawn and get stuck? How's going on in the facial area? Do I just say I have a small section of my head dehydrated? What is happening right here? You're like, oh, I don't know. Ah. I was a kid. I could play Street Football for 10 hours, bounce off a car, a fender I was fine. Yesterday I pulled a neck muscle ordering food and looking left. I was like, yeah, let me get it. Oh, that's got to be something serious. Hold on, what's that, bro? Hold on, what's that? No, seriously, it's just in my lung area. It's floating in a rib. I'll be fine. Just give me a second. My boy's like, what'd you do? I'm like, oh, shit, I talked and turned. I can't talk and turn. He knew. He's like, don't do that, bro. You got to pause. You know, superhero. Are you crazy? There's air involved, man. Wake up. Can't just have run out sentences. What's up, Mike Young? Jason, what up? Just living. What's happening? All right, here's the deal. My boy Paul's got two hedge fund guys out of New York. They read my script. They love the movie. They say they want to fund the movie and maybe let me direct it. They've got to make $12,500,000 films this year. For some reason, they have to spend the money. I don't know, some kind of tax code. Rich people, shit. Will you please give them a call? You know, I will, baby. Look, if they got real money, put you in a three-pitcher deal. Slive my life story right inside that motherfucker. You know, there's some interest in shit before I manage it, Mike Young. My life will make a hell of a movie. Well, that's great. But can we work on making my movie first? Yeah, man. You didn't even need to ask that shit? Well, I feel like I do. I wish I didn't, but I do. I'll talk to you later, man. I'll see you this week. Hey, listen, you got to swing by the new crib. You don't love that motherfucker. All right, I'll talk to you later. MUSIC This is fucking bullshit, bro. One day she's in to me the next day radio silence. Things were going great. I don't think they were ever going great, Stevie. You're a disaster right now. Do yourself a favor. Go off the grid for six days, and on day seven she'll wake up calling you out of nowhere. Why seven days? Women have a clock in their head. They don't hear from you for six days. They wake up day seven. Everybody gets a phone call. Let's do this seven day thing in like seven days, because I told her we're going to help us set up a birthday party. So you're in? Absolutely not. But maybe. MUSIC You ever leave your friends and go, why are we still hanging out? MUSIC This table's got to be thinking that shit right now. MUSIC This poor guy has to be well done. MUSIC Just wondering how you got here. MUSIC I got one friend so lazy his goal was for me to make it. That's a bad goal. MUSIC I can't be your goal, bro. MUSIC Hello. MUSIC Well, I've fucked a rapper in my parents living room last night. You know what? I'm 100% on board with it. I need a shot. You know, put your pussy on time out, Heather. Seriously, you're going to get killed out there in this treat. Be careful. Women are the new men. I met one girl. She was married, dating, and sort of seeing somebody. Good for her. I'd love to meet her. You know what? I'm having a great time for your information. My divorce is final. I haven't felt this free in years. And I think I might really like this Devante guy. He's a beautiful person. He's a poet. He's fucking hot. Really? What happened to you just dating dudes around here? Oh, all my dick moved to Venice. That's literally the greatest sense I've ever heard in my life. All I'm going to write that down. Absolutely. Yeah, no straight white hedge fund dick is worth traffic on the town. I'll write that down too. Oh, do you want to come to the studio with me? Devante is recording a new song. You wants me to hear it? I love the studio. Are you kidding me? You can't go there by yourself. You look at your maid out of a fendee bag. You know, I've been thinking about Saturday night. Liz has a friend. I think she's a single mom. So we're probably better off doing like a low-key dinner, and then we'll turn it up in our chat. Hell no, bro. Single moms don't want fun and food. Single moms want cocaine and house music. Cocaine? And I had a good cocaine. Yeah, I don't do cocaine, but I can get cocaine. I used to open for Ron White, Dave Chappelle, Mike Epps. I can get you cocaine weed and a gun. Thursday at noon. I got friends going through divorce. If you're going through it, I'm sorry. It's ugly. You know what I mean? But quit trying to hang out with me. You're embarrassing me. All right, quit trying to hang out with single Mike. It's making me, you know what I mean? You don't have my immune system yet. You don't just go from divorce to single. All right, you got to stretch out for a month. Yeah, you got a weak system, OK? You got kids, your kid walks in, sneezes, your whole family's a mess for a week. I make out with a stripper on a Wednesday just to clear my sinuses. I'm disgusting. I'm like a walking Z-pack right now. I can't even catch a cold. I'm not proud of it. I'm going through a phase. Married friends, stop your vicarious living. All right, it's killing me. It's stressing me out. And I don't need your secrets. That's too many secrets. I'm not a vault. Not a vault. All right, fuck. Work on that bit. Am I divorce friends coming to hang out at the club? Just what are you doing? Take a minute. You know what I mean? Showing girls pictures of your kid's soccer team. What's wrong with you, bro? This girl's 26 years old. Break out the cocaine and tell a lie. She does not want to see the picture of the kid's soccer team. She was on that team four years ago. She's in the picture. What the fuck is wrong with you? Stop it. You're embarrassing everybody. The forced guys are depressing to watch, especially the forced guys with money. You see a divorce, a divorce rich guy? There are mess. That's where Granpa pussy came from. Yeah, I don't care what side of your eye. It doesn't matter. Granpa and the pussy was never the thing.

That should be terrible. Yeah, if you clap for Vegas, that means you've been once. That is the worst place in the world. Oh, you think you have fun, right? But then you get to Vegas. Every Vegas trip is the same. You're like, yeah, we're going to Vegas. We're going to make money. We're going to meet girls eight hours in the day one. Yo, broke. Give me the hell out of here right now. I don't even care how I get home. I'll hitchhike. Where are you going? Arizona, drop me off. I'll start a candle company. I'll start my whole life over. I've never been this suicidal before. You go to Vegas. You lose money. You ever lose money? Start rationalizing the trip. I'm trying to pretend you're even. You start counting shit up. It doesn't matter. No, brawm even. I got a free clothes sandwich and I swam. I'm killing it, bro. I saw white tigers. That's going to be too grand. I'm actually up $1,500. I went to the mirage. It's like a jungle. What's Africa? 20,000? Bro, I am killing at this trip. It's depressing losing money. There's always a guy that can take what he wants to give you advice that you need to be asked for. You're just thinking out loud like, oh, I should. I hit his six against a eight. Well, you got nothing to lose. And then you lose. I've never seen that before. It's a carotawatt. It's happening. My Detroit criminal mind kicks in. I'm like, I don't know if fucking snatch this guy's chips. And they party hard at Vegas. Yeah, they party too hard. Anytime it's 5 a.m., and you see a 70-year-old man moonwalking, go home, bro. Go home. Guys, have a more fun than everybody. Leave me a like, junior. What were I? When you single, everybody trusts you. Trust somebody else. As soon as you tell me a secret, my first thought is, who can I tell? I can't wait to tell somebody. Yo, what's going on, honey? Mikey, Mikey, Mikey. Have you seen the new girl upstairs in a pop before, dear? No, who is? Yeah, I can't really get into it. Building policy, I could fight. Dollar chain, right? But she used to be an adult. Don't actors. Now she's transitioning into real estate. That's an amazing transition. But she also still dabbles. Oh, you don't just dabble there, man. There's no half dabble in the house. She still dabbles. That's a tough dab. And again, I can't say anything because of building policy, but I fixed a washer and dry the other day, and then we're sex toys, everyone. Wow, man. That's an incredible story. Do me a favor, honey. While I have you here, can you please just check my washing machine, take a quick look at it. Let's make it a weird sound. Yeah. Yeah, not now. I'll stop back later. You got your work gloves, man? Yeah, no, I'll be back. I'll be back. You know what I say? Love the flaws. Just accept each other's flaws. You'll be good. You know what I mean? Foulish, just look at your girl like, oh, babe, that's so cute. But you yell at me about shit that never happened. So adorable. Keep losing your keys. I'm going to hold you forever. I'm so cute. Leave me having another game. Kill the whole family. I want to hold you. Come here. You're so pretty. What's up, Mike, young? Look at you. Working from home now, huh? Shit, yeah. I'm going to take shoes off. Yeah, man. Every day is casual Tuesday. You got to worry about nobody trying to spew my parking space as fucking quiet. Save a shit ton on gas. And you got to worry about other managers trying to steal my fucking clients. What's happening, man? You get it, Bill. Good, man. I'm good. How you doing? I'm good. You know, did you talk to Paul? Those guys getting the money for the movie, what do you think? Is it going to happen? Did you talk to him? Sepsy. Is it out, man? Relax. No. I'm going to slow play him. Let him call me a few more times. Make him hungry. Let him know you're busy. But I'm not busy. I'm the opposite of busy. I don't want to slow play. I need a quick play. All right, reverse psychology. Not the move on this one. I got something else I want to put you down with. Hit me out. So I sold a show to Discovery Channel. You sold a show? How did you sell a show? You're a manager. You know I love old cars, right? Yeah, but I think we're way off track right now, man. Did you know that in 1983, Corvette didn't make a car? What about my career? The plan's already laid. Just hit me out, right? They get. So I tell these cats, what if we design a 83-Vet? All of a charity every week. Motherfucker gets a car and his life together. It's like a make-a-wish for car lovers. Motherfucker's will love that shit. What do you think they said? They want me to direct. That's a done deal when we get going, baby. They said they want the show. And they want me to host that motherfucker. So you're telling me that my manager is hosting a show that he also created? God is good, Mike. Is nobody happy with where they are in life? My doctor wants to be an actor. My waiter wants to be a screenwriter. And my manager wants to do everything except manage me. If my doctor's too busy thinking about his one-man show, I could be dead. I couldn't drink it for a year. I'm back. I'm back. That's right. For a stupid year. I remember the whole year. You don't need to remember the whole year. You don't need to mean there's no reason for it. I got regrets. You don't need to remember my regrets. My one of these people is like, I got no regrets for what's good with life. You got no regrets. I just mean you're an asshole. I got no regrets. You ever noticed some more expensive to alcohol, the cooler the buzz? I drank Hennessy. I thought I was an 82-year-old black jazz musician. I started giving advice for no reason. I was like, you got to work hard, Jr. Ain't no shortcuts in life, playboy. But then you drink cheap shit like wild turkey. Like, I'm going to shoot a relative. You don't talk to me like that in a family function. I put this picnic on. And then you drink Jack Daniels. You ever drink whiskey? Some friend has an emotional outburst for no reason. Mike, I know you 20 years, bro. I killed for you, bro. You don't have to. I want to. I'm tired of waiting. Your father was a good man. You're like, he's not even dead. He doesn't care.

All right, let me just turn this into the best party I've ever heard of. Fuck it. Did my head bat, Mom? You're on mom. If you got kids, God bless you. All my friends have kids now. Everybody's kids are genius. Why is everybody's kid a genius? Can't anybody just admit it? Fuck it. Reading's not his thing. It's OK if your kid's not a genius. My dad was not making things up about me. You know what I mean? How's Michael doing in school? Shit, he's in school. I haven't seen him in two weeks. I've seen some of you have smart kids, but it's weird. My buddy's kid is one. He's one. My boy's like, look at my kid, bro. He's analyzing you. Oh, is he? I'm sorry. I thought he was drooling on his foot. You look at the kid. It's like he's humming bubbles. Ah! He doesn't even know I'm in the room. There's no way your kid's a genius, bro. You're his dad. I've known you too long. I know some of you have smart kids. I've got a nephew, 12 years old, smarter than me, and knows it. It's like he's making fun of me in public, asking me questions I can't answer. It's like, Uncle Mike, how come the moon is there? Oh, shit. Why is the moon there? I don't know. That's where God threw it. Google that shit. Don't embarrass me at a picnic. You know what I know. We're on the same reading level. I wish I was great and bad every time. I've accepted it. I'm amazingly average. I don't care because every now and then I'll have an Olympic moment. I don't even know where it comes from. Every guy does the same shit. What did I eat today? I got to start off every day with Crunch Berry and Advil. That was some kind of chemical reaction. This is the new Viagra. Mix it in a bowl. This girl gave me a try Viagra. I don't know what she's like, will you be my guinea pig? I was like, yeah, I risk a heart attack and blindness. Let's go. I got nothing to lose. Let's see what happens when one eye shuts. I don't care. Fuck my elbow. Let's see what goes down. I don't care if one foot is numb. Let's do everything. What the hell is in Viagra? That shit works. I was in the kitchen having sex in the living room. Man, that shit should be illegal. I was making eggs and love. I don't even know if I was there. Just cooking and fucking, I don't know. And you have sex in a Viagra. You get a bad attitude. Oh, you just think you're the king. Yeah, guys, we do. Why I started yelling out commens that don't even make sense. I was like, yeah, you know what just happened? Part my hair. Wash my pinky, talk my hair. Wash my pinky, talk backwards now. Everybody's afraid of a loan time. Everyone's afraid to be a loan. Don't be afraid. I don't mind my loan time. I treat me great. I watch a movie, sip toquila, make some food. Fuck it. I take me out. I wake up in the morning. I got my own phone number. I call me. What are you doing? Nothing. You feel like hanging? Not tonight. I'm getting to know me. Do you have a toothbrush? Fellas, we thought we had money. We didn't. We realized the cost of living wasn't high. The cost of pretending ruined us. It's all right, though, fellas. I got good news. Personality's making a comeback. It's the year of personality. Trust me. I got eight jokes in a Honda court. I'm sleeping with everybody. Funds, the new money. We had so much fun. She forgot we didn't eat. She's just home, hungry and happy. I wish that was true. What a week. I barely got into my own show. I played men's league hoops and I had to leave early. I met a great girl who came to my apartment and refused to leave. I almost got killed for wearing a red shirt and a blue neighborhood. Let me tell you something. Being single is exhausting. And dangerous. Hey, you're a comedian, right? I've seen you at the comedy store, Mike Young. Yeah, a comedian. I also direct when nobody knows. Cool. I'm Johnny. I just moved in here. Jenny. Oh, 4B Jenny. 1A Mike. Cool. Yeah. God bless you in New York. What's up, Mike Young? Yo, what's up, Jason? Any word? Yeah, I spoke to Paul's money, guys. You got great news. Beautiful. Yeah, shit ain't gonna happen. How was that great news? You know, one dough closes, six more open. It's just mother nature at work, you know that shit. Look at this and research and they're looking for some diversity or something, you know. Tough time to be a straight white male, Mike Young. It's great, man. Keep me posted. You know, I will, Mike Young. You did find time to read your script and it's fantastic. It is very good. Unfortunately, you can't afford me. So, I pass. But if you ever get some money, I'd love to do it. And I think I should play some more in the range of like 38 to 41 range. Because... All right. Good luck with that now. Did you just hang up? I'm afraid the boarding happens. You got to shut the fuck up, bro. And I'm just being nice. I don't want you to get thrown out. Get out of me. I don't want you to get thrown out. I'm trying to save you. Jesus, I know I'm in a tough town. I think I got back on. This is a tough town. I don't like to fight, man. I got my skinny neck. You're doing the same thing on the fuck around. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you.

 Everybody, I was thinking about the first time like Congress had to come up with age of consent. I had to be like the powdered wigs and stuff that had to be a rough day for the fellas. It's like some guy coming up first like from Rhode Island, 12 and I was like, ew, ew, no dude. I don't know why I had to go first on this one. It's like the hardest one to go first on. No, I don't like that. Just talking shit. It's exciting. I was a little too excited. I panicked and got this haircut. What an insane fuck up. My hair was fine. It was totally fine. And then two days ago I was like, I gotta salvage this. It's crazy that I thought my hair was, I was like, if I fix my hair I'll look good. That was the final piece of the puzzle. For me. There's a Dominican barbershop by my house in New York. I'm thinking the first white guy that's ever been in there. I was basically Christopher Columbus of this barbershop and they fucked me up dude. Don't get, if you're white don't get a Dominican haircut. You end up just looking more racist. It was nice though. He kept trying to reassure me the whole time. He was like, no man, it's good. It's all like, it comes in your head. It's good. It's like, oh thank you. Whatever. Fuck this haircut. How are you guys? Fuck. It's good. It's good. I'm happy. It's nice. Everybody's back inside all that shit. I don't know. I had a good, I like to go. I had a nice time. I live in New York so I left. I went back to my parents house. Because I have white privilege. Some people didn't get to leave the city. I did because of my privilege and I used it. You got to use it. You know what I mean? Doesn't feel more disrespectful to wasted. You know what? Then we're all just being racist for nothing. All right. But no, it's good. I went home. My parents, I went with them and over 10 years they got old. Their old is fucking. It's milk though. I'm back on milk. I'm fucking crushing milk lately. I got fucking milk fat this year. It's a weird time in life to have a milk renaissance. It's 33. But it was nice. I think my favorite part of the year was I got to watch my dad watch the news. There's a rough year for my dad and the news. He's a Fox News guy. Don't do that. It's fine. Also I see you guys. Most of you have Fox News dads. How dare you deny your fathers. That's a good dad. I don't watch Fox, but that's a good Fox News mom. That's bad. You don't want a Fox News mom. That's a bad mom. She smokes in the house. But a Fox News dad, that's a good fucking dad. Can you imagine if you had a fucking MSNBC dad? There's some guy every night at dinner like we need to start focusing on renewable energy. It's like, ew, dude. I didn't know dad was gay. Talking about solar panels like a fucking lady. He might add a straight as hell. Dude, we fucking hate the environment. That's how straight we are. Oh, we talk about us eating pussy and fracking. We hate nature. We go fishing. We don't even eat fish. Dude, we just catch them and fucking. No, he's good. He likes, he watches Fox. He watches it every night. Like every Fox News dad. My dad watches Fox every night until he can't. That's how long they watch. They watch every night until they get so angry they have to go to bed. My dad watch for like two hours and then out of nowhere, he'll just stand up and be like, fucking Mr. Potato heads. Trance, I'm going to bed. Who else's going to hell? He's all about it, dude. Like every Fox News dad, my dad watches Fox with one goal. He's just trying to get one fact. It's all he's doing. He's sitting there, he's trying to retain one piece of information that he can then relay to whoever's unlucky enough to enter the living room while he's watching. And you think it'd be easy to get one fact, but every once in a while there's like a commercial for like a commemorative 9-11 gold coin. Just fucking wipes their hard drive. I was like, what was I watching? I got one of those, I got my hands on those patriotic coins. My dad drinks too, so he can never, he can never get a fact. Ever. You'll come in the living room and be, he's hammered watching the news every night, which is the wildest way to take in world politics. Like just hammered on a recliner like, whoa. It's like footage of rocket attacks in Israel. He's like, whoa. The hell are they doing over there? What's these guys problem? But he can never get a fact. Like he tries, he tries, he uses Fox News as like a PowerPoint for what he's trying to say. Like everyone, like we'll be eating dinner and like, Hannity, he'll be saying something. He's like, see? That's what I meant. Look at that. That's me talking. I can't say it that good. You can never get a fact. You'll walk in the living room, he's been watching the news for three hours. He'll be like, all right, what's going on in the world? He's like, you want to know? I'll tell you, fucking Nancy Pelosi's a bitch. That's like, all right. Settle down, dude. That was the news last, that's the news every night for my dad. It's just like breaking. You know Nancy Pelosi's a bitch? I was like, yeah, yeah. I had a feeling. But like everything they say he agrees with. He's all in. I realize like Fox News is basically black church for old white dudes. You know what I mean? Like literally everything they say, my dad just says like, mm-hmm. Yes, preach Tucker. Every once in a while, it gets here with the Holy Spirit while he's watching it. The Holy Ghost visits him and he's just like, oh, no, build a wall. Can I get a wall? He needs a wall. My dad needs a wall. For a guy who lives in Central Pennsylvania, securing the Southern border. It's like an oddly important tone. I don't know what he's worried about. Like he's going to lose his job. You know, like some guy from Honduras is going to walk the whole way to Pennsylvania. Just slam a resume down on my dad's boss's desk. So you're here for the sales position? I'm safe now. Stay quiet on that. Also, I was just at the border of Arizona and Mexico. There's a wall. I had no idea. I got down there. I saw the wall. I was like, holy shit. He built it. They were like, no, it's been here. It's been here for like a century. I was like, no, you got to tell my dad. Fucking him up. He gets fired up every night. It's a crazy way to go to bed every night. So there's apnea mask on. Fucking. Every night. Fucking carodaran. You walk into the living room in my house right now, my dad. You know, I saw the borders of mess right at night. That's crazy. But I make fun of him for it. And then I do the exact same thing just with my phone. I just look at my phone until I can. I'm like, Mr. Potato, what the fuck? That's it. Every day. I just get on read opinions from people I know are dumb. Like in person, I know they're dumb. I've talked to them. And I'm still reading their Twitter, their political opinions. It's great. And my Twitter is crazy. It's half where I'm from, which is the middle of Pennsylvania. So it's white trash. And then half. Now I live in New York. So it's crazy. Like, you know, I still have uncles. They all just got Twitter. They're all fucking fired up. They haven't fun. Do they all have like zero followers? They just tweet into the void. They love it, dude. They do it for the love of the game. Like, Panera was good today. It's onto a server that will outlast civilization. And then now all my new friends are literally communists from Brooklyn. So it's wild, dude. Like I'll get on Twitter. And the first tweet I see will be someone from back home that's just like fucking Colin Kavernic better stand up. Like this tweet, if you support the police, share it if you're not gay. Oh, I'm fucking sharing. I share that. And the next post is just one of my new joke white friends that's just like, I'm not racist. That's it. Every day for the last year, just a different white person popping up. Like, look at me. Look at this article I shared to my Instagram story. I'm not racist, right? All right. You sure? So I don't know if you know this. Like being racist isn't like a yes or no thing. You know what I mean? It's not like you have it or you don't have it. Like being racist is more like being hungry. You know? It's like, yeah, you're not right now. You know? So yeah, you're not hungry right now, but a cheeseburger could cut you off on the highway. And you get hungry. You're hungry all day. The cheeseburger is Jewish in that joke. No, no, no, no, no. Cheeseburgers, whatever type of cheeseburger you thought it was. And your racist heart. Anyway, that's it. I just get online, read opinions from people. The news, like other news is kind of like this is the most divided this country has ever been. It's like with the red states and the blue states. It's like, why? Because we tweet at each other. You know, we had a war, right? You know, this country had a civil war. That was pretty divided. Like at least nowadays we're communicating with each other. Back then, those guys never, they got the news like once a month. Some guy would come by on a horse and they were like, who's talking shit? Like I was like, the south is talking shit. Fuck that. I don't like that. Give me my gun. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to walk down there for a month straight. Shoot the first fucking guy I see down there. That's how much. The civil war was basically just the north just shooting racism out of the south. That's what happened. The north was like south fucking chill. And the south was like, no. So a bunch of guys had to walk down there and shoot him a lot. They were like, all right. We'll let him go. Or not going to be nice to him for a while. Until we find out they're good at football and then roll tide. That way, fucking. It rolled amt. I don't like Albanne with football. I just watched his documentary on Albanne football. It's great. It's about Albanne football. It's about when they desegregated their football team. So up until this point, Albanne football was just white. Everybody down there was pumped on that. They would pack the stadium. Everyone would be like, look at all those whites. Run around, catch it. I'm not knocking them too hard because I still have a little bit of that. In me, you know, like if a white guy catches a ball on Sunday, I'm like, oh shit, go, go, go, go, go. They got him. They got him. The top run is smart run. That's up run there. But now they took it too far. So the documentary focuses on that. The focus is on Bear Bryant, legendary head coach. He was the head coach that brought the first black players onto the team. So the whole documentary is like celebrating Bear Bryant. They're like fucking way to go, Bear. You did it. What a hero. And then you find out it was 1971. Yeah, a little late for high fives on this one, fellas. Holy shit, 71. Like we've been to the moon. There were literally people on the screen. There were literally people on the moon before Alabama had black guys in their secondary. Does anyone understand? There were white corners. White corner backs. You understand how preposterous that is? Some of you are too young to have ever even seen a white corner. They're extinct. They don't exist. There's two left at the San Diego Zoo. They won't reproduce. You'll never see a white corner. But that's what happened. It wasn't like the reason they desegregated the team. That's what the documentary focuses on, which is great. Because it wasn't like, oh, hey, fellas, it's 1971. Maybe we should get with the times. What happened was Alabama's scheduled USC Southern Cal. Alabama's confident. They're like, oh, white ballers. We'll take on anybody. And then USC came down to Alabama with a bunch of black dudes from LA. It just beat the fuck out of Alabama. And then after the game, Bear Bryant gave like a speech and he was like, hey, y'all. Come on. That was it. That's all it took. Everybody down there was like, yeah, we get it. We'll be less racist. It means we can win. What? That's what it is. Like as big as racism is in America football. That's true. Look, there's a Disney movie. Remember the Titans dedicated to what I just told you. The whole point of that, dude, that was one high school football season. Remember the Titans was like, it was eight weeks. Enough. That whole town went from like centuries of like, don't let them in our school to just like, oh shit, the high school teams 4 and 0. Those are my brothers. I'll get off the topic. The point, look, the point I'm trying to make. The point I'm trying to make is if you want to get rights in America, you just got put together a good football team. You know what I mean? If the transgender's got together and put together just a fucking hard nose, run it down your throat, ball cup. If the transgender's just three yards in a cloud of dust, transgender's. If the transgender's community could just somehow upset Alabama. Everybody down there tomorrow would be like, those are some tough bitches, actually. Alright. Alright, we got out of that. There's some rough batches in there, that's alright. This won't go great either. You know how like every show and movie now, it's like a remake of something. They just remake an old thing and just make it like more progressive and just put it out. They remake, they remake Ocean's Eleven like a heist movie with like all gorgeous women. That movie should have been ten minutes long. They literally should have got to the casino and just blown the security guards. Maybe all, here's the keys to safe. Take everything. I love you. You guys, you crazy bitches. I love you bitches. That's it. That's all they make. They either make that or they make like, they make slavery movies every year. Those are for no one. I have black friends. I was like, dude, you guys like these? I was like, no, we thought you got these for you. It's like, no. We all hate those. Stop making them. It's uncomfortable. Civil rights movies are good though. I like like like, like, like, like, Judas in the Black Messiah was sick. Remember the Titans is great. Hidden figures was the movie about the Black ladies at NASA. Or is my dad like, to call it, Medea goes to the moon. And look, that was him that said that. He said that as soon as he said that. I was like, what did you fucking say? You don't talk like that. So every movie is just remade is more progress. I just think it'd be funny if like, the right started remaking. You know what I mean? If they just start like conservatives, like, there's a new Scooby-Doo coming out. And it'd be funny if like, the right remade it. It's just like, Scooby and the gang going around, ripping the wigs off the transgender people. It's like, that's not a woman. Some guy would have got away with it. We solved the case of the Starbucks ghoul. As enough time passed that we can, can we admit that Trump was funny? Can we finally admit that he was funny? Well, hold on. I don't like the tone of that. That's not what I'm going for here. The great leader. He was funny. Now whether or not that's a great quality, the commander-in-chief, that's definitely up for debate. But he was funny. I saw it. And I lived in New York, so the whole time he was in office, I would be like, you know, something would happen. I'd show my friends up there. Look at that. They'd be like, what? All right, but it's funny. Like, there's nothing funny about Donald Trump. I don't know. During Hurricane Dorian, he was like, maybe we should nuke it. Like, that was a real suggestion from the president. The president said that. The president of the United States. He was like, hey, we got a big storm coming. You guys want me to blow it up? I was like, no, what the fuck are you talking about? I don't know. I fuck around, dude. That's what I do. I don't know. Nowadays he's gone. I'll never, like I'll never watch a debate ever again. You imagine like just a regular debate now? After we wouldn't, like we witnessed the go. Undefeated. In debates. And he never said a fact. You know, I'm pressive that is. He was funny and he argued like a fifth grader. He was unstoppable. People would try to hit him with statistics and facts. He would just go, wrong. Like, holy fuck, dude. How was no one prepared for this? Go back and watch those debates. You forget how electric that shit was. Don't tell your friends in Austin. They'll be mad. Just get a six pack. Talks on a Trump highlight video on YouTube. It's a good night, dude. Why I went back. I watched his first debate. That's like my favorite one. At the time, Trump was pulling it like less than 1%. Like he was no one liked him. If you guys like him now, you didn't back then. And I know that because my dad, I watched my dad. My dad at the time, he would like any time Trump even came on TV. My dad would go, good day. Good day to you guys. He was like, you have to wait for the time. You would like any time Trump even came on TV. You might have, like, good just fucking Joker. Get him off the fucking screen. And then now my dad's like, you're all fucking guys can't go to the Capitol. He's like, you guys can't have fun anymore. And it was coming to the debates. That's how we got Trump. These debates. And the first one was the best one. So he said Republican Prime Minister, everyone's up on stage. still doing their political shit. So like the first couple guys that talk are like, I'm from Kentucky and I love the education. And the crowd's like, nice. We didn't know what was coming. And the next guy's like, I'm from Georgia and I love religion. The crowd's like, pretty good. This is a good one. This is a heated debate. And then I finally got to Trump's turn to talk. And he was just like, Rand Paul is ugly and the whole crowd was like, oh! You know you could do that in this. You can just do that as your thing. And Rand Paul's like, all right, everybody settle down. We're trying to have a debate here. And the whole crowd was like, shut the fuck up, Rand Paul. Ugly bitch. And we just kept throwing dorks up on stage to make them debate Trump. It was not fair. It was mean for us to have done that to people. These guys were in politics their whole lives. They just had to debate a fucking maniac up there. Who didn't give a fuck to. And I hate it. It was fun to cheer for him in the debates. It was fun to cheer for him in the debates. Because he was going up against guys that had been in politics for like 40 years. And then he showed up to the event, like, oh fuck it, what are we talking about? He had no clue. Every week he had no fucking idea. There's one debate. There's one debate. In the middle of it going back and forth about the economy with Ted Cruz. They're literally talking about the economy. And in the middle of it he's just like, Ted's wife, ugly as a dog. Like this. Holy shit, dude. And Ted was like, I'm from Texas. You don't talk about a man's family like that. You've got a dog wife, Ted. I was like, everyone knows. So. Yeah, and a week later, Ted Cruz was on TV, like, I support Donald Kennedy. It was like, you pussy. I will say this. The one thing that sucked about Trump losing was for me was because I just figured out kind of how to do his voice. That's kind of a bummer that I just, it's not hard to do Trump. It's very, all you have to do that is do that. Do that a second off from where it should be in the sentence. And then all you, like, you don't have to sound like him. All you have to do is get his cadence down. It's very easy. All you have to do is describe something and then say you described it that way. That's it. It's every time. What a big room this is. I walked in here. I said, wow, what a big room. That's it. Every time. Austin. A lot of homeless. I walked in here. I said, wow, that's a lot of homeless. You guys got it. You got it homeless. You got to, what are you guys doing about it? Whatever you guys are doing is not working. So just switch. I don't know what to do either. But do something. A lot of tents. Why? It's been making me laugh thinking about Trump, like, not understanding why people are homeless. I walked out of my stomach. I said, why? Living in tents, I could never these guys. But I will say this about trial. I don't want you guys to get, I don't want to turn this into a rally. I don't want you to. I will say this. I don't freak out. Just listen. I think it's fair to say that of all the presidents we've had, I think it's fair to say that Trump would have been the funniest one to see get shot. You know? Dude, the Patriots got fired up on that, dude. Let's have him fun at this show. No, look, I didn't even say it would be funny. I said, funny-est. It's a huge difference. Technically, there's a funniest of everything. There it is. It doesn't make it funny, but there is, like, think of the worst thing you can think of. There's a funniest one. I'll go first. I'll think of one. It's closer to you. None of those are funny. Zero funny. But maybe there was one where the horse girl in the class could sense something was coming. You know what I mean? They were like, what's wrong? And she was like, pfft. I was like, pfft. You know? But back to what I was saying about it. If you had what I said was true. If you had to rank them from least funny to funniest assassination, easy number one. Really? He'd be talking shit like when it happened. He'd be doing another rally. My opponent's gay. I walked in. I saw him. I said, well, this guy's gay. The shooter would be coming out of you. Sit down. You were gay. You were gay. You get hit. He'd definitely make a funny noise into them. Like, you'd get hit back. Pfft. It fell. You fall funny. I will say, I did write that joke before Biden could be added to the rankings. I don't think he would be the funniest, but the only reason Biden might be the funniest is because I think Biden's the first president you could punch assassinate. You know what I mean? Just walk right through the metal text, and say, Mr. President, oh, what are you doing? Do you mind? It's a body shot. I dad that joke. My dad's. He gave me a talk about killing presidents. I'm like, what about Biden? He's like, yeah. My dad's, he's a good. Good guy. He's an alcoholic. But he's good. He's like a good. He's a good alcoholic. He's not hurting anybody. But everyone's always has an excuse while he's drinking. That's what's funny about it. Like, he can never just get hammered at me. Like, yeah, I got fucked up. Like, it's always, like, you'll see him on like a Monday. You'll be like, damn, it's Monday. You're getting fucked up. He's like, it's fucking Monday night football. I have a couple drinks. Jeez. You'll see him on like a Tuesday. You'll be like, damn, it's Tuesday. You're getting fucked up. He's like, it's fucking. There's no football. What the hell? And then my sister does heroin. And that one where like, you do need to, you know, you need to stop doing that. Which sucks for her, because if she played guitar, everybody would be like, uh, yeah. I'm gonna step she's a hairdresser here, so. That's not as cool. Relax. It's my family. It's my family. Don't worry about it. Actually, based on this crowd, I'm sure it's actually a lot of you guys. Families. And that's all right. We're allowed to talk about it. My sister, so she was doing heroin. We had to have an intervention for her. She lived down in Pittsburgh. We live in the middle of Pennsylvania, so we had to trick her to come home. You got to trick them. I don't know if you know these guys. They're not just fucking stopping by. They're very busy. They're the busiest people. They get a bad rap for being lazy. Does it take a lot of naps? But if they're awake, they're fucking, you're very busy. They're scaring around. They're doing quests. That's what they do. If you do heroin long enough, you run out of money. You got to start doing quests. You know, it's like a fucked up game of Zelda every day. You just wake up to a new quest. It's like, you need to gather coppers. You're going to find a scrap yard. It sounds nice. I wish I got quests. But eventually the quests get pretty dark. Scrappy yard. That's like level one. Towards the end, the quests, you need to get titty fucked behind the home depot. That's what it's time for a change. So we had to come up with a plan to trick her to come home for the intervention. The plan we came up with was we told her that we had won tickets to go to six flags. And it worked. She called back. She's like, all right, I'll be there. She got on the first bus. It's like a seven hour bus ride. There's nothing to them, dude. If you take heroin, every bus is a bullet train. There's a five minute ride, tops. Anyway, so the plan was pick my sister up from the bus stop, not take her to six flags. Take her to a hotel where we're going to have an intervention. I didn't want to start the intervention with like a lack of trust. So I took her to six flags. The day of her intervention, that day she and I went to six flags together. And I thought that was a nice gesture, but it turns out intervention is supposed to be rock bottom. You know what I mean? Like intervention is supposed to be the worst day of your life. Not like you're tired from easily the best day. Humanly, I mean, she took heroin and rode roller coasters. It was, dude, it was impossible. We sat it out and we thought, you better fucking change your life. She's like, I don't want to go back tomorrow. We're like, no. And I was with her. She was fucked up. If you know anyone from Pittsburgh, you know what she was wearing. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants. Steelers pajama pants. She dusted off her finest tines award for the occasion. So we get in there. There's a water park there. We didn't know. They added that. We haven't been there since we were kids. We get in there. There's one of those water slides. It's just like a fucking straight drop. Like no sides on it, no raft. Just by yourself. She looks at it. She's like, I want to go up on that one. I was like, yeah, yeah, fuck it. You know? I knew she was going to rehab like that night. So I was like, yeah, good, this one in. You're about to have a rough couple months here. That's just gonna be. Also, I figured they would stop her. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants. Trying to get on a water slide. All they did was make her take her fucking crocs off. There's your yellow scrubs. So she's climbing up this ladder. She gets to the top of this fucking giant water slide. And you know how like when it's your turn next on a water ride, you gotta like lay there in that water and like wait to go. She, she knotted off. She took a nap up at the top like a Dracula. Laying in front of some high school lifeguard that's like, man, it's your turn. They just center down there to sleep. Just, just flying down this thing, dude. She hit, there's a ramp at the end. She hit her, we all got to watch her wake up in air. And she did the whole fucking... You know, I don't know how that wasn't fucking rock bottom. It's like you woke up in air. Anyway, don't be sad about it. She's good, she did go to rehab. And that's good, yeah, she's done. She stopped using it, she's sober, she's all good. Two years clean, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's good. She did get cancer though. And COVID. Cancer and COVID. Bam, bam, bam. Why? So, yeah, I'll tell you what, this was cool. I got, I was with her, I lit, she was at home, she went back to my parents, because when you have cancer and COVID, you gotta go home. You have to go home, you can't keep hanging out. But no, I was with her, it was crazy. She, this year she beat heroin cancer and COVID. It was like living with fucking Rocky. It was crazy dude, every week my whole family was like, give up, you're never gonna win this. She's like, he's kept winning. When she got COVID, I was like, all right, you're definitely dead. She's like, oh, COVID. So, I ain't here no bell. This fucking is wailed on it, dude. Yeah, she's got a hell of a chin. Hell of a chin on my sister. And that's what, what better quality could you ask for in a human? Anyway. Damn, dudes. Fuck that music across the street, dude, that fucking bothers me. I'm an old man now, turn it down. Turn it down, what is that, rap? Turn it off. I gotta talk about my sister, ruin heroin over here. This has been making me laugh. I've been thinking about like the first time, like Jesus Christ. I do comedy a lot. And every once in a while you can hear music from another room and it's like, damn, dude, music's so much better than God. Every time I hear music, I'm like, fuck, dude, that shit crushes what I do. Some fucking idiot dressed like Cam Newton, press and play. It's so much better than this. Like, you guys want to hear about my problems? This guy's like, take Molly, finger someone, press play, you guys do you. Fuck, there haven't so much fun over there. Get out of here, you motherfucker, go dance. I knew you wanted to dance. Like I wanted to dance all night. Alright, I like my family. It's a good family. I had to go to my niece's seventh and eighth grade girls volleyball match recently. No, kidding, I'm kidding, dude, shut up. Just relax. I don't want to fuck kids. But if you ever want to get out of something, that's all you have to do. Like, if you're a friend, like, do you want to come to our son's T-Ball game? Be like, what grade are the kids in? And then no matter what they say, go, oh, fourth. No, I went to this fucking kids volleyball match. Can we knock it off with volleyball shorts on little kids? It's weird. It's gross, dude, just get them gym shorts. That's all. No, dude, it's gross. Because then, you know, it's just me and the other uncles up in the bleachers kind of make an eye contact with each other. Bro, are you seeing this? Such a funny way to just destroy a show. Just right at the very end, be like, aren't kids hot? You know, give it up for Trump. Aren't kids hot? No, I am truly I'm serious about the gym shorts though. It's weird. And so I got home from this fucking volleyball match. My roommate, his girlfriend played college volleyball. So I'm very excited to like, shit on volleyball whenever I can't. So I get in there and I was like, you know, volleyball is fucking, that's a weird culture. Get them fucking shorts. Get them gym shorts. The shorts they're wearing is gross. And she was like, no. We need those shorts for speed on the court. And I was like, I know that's not true. I watched the NBA. None of you are moving as fast as like a ref. And those guys are wearing like slacks dress shoes for some reason. She was like, no, we need those shorts. The tight shorts they're essential. She compared them to like a helmet in football. I was like, I know they're not essential because I googled the special Olympics volleyball team. All of a sudden those shorts weren't so essential for them. What's that about? How baggy do you think they're? They looked like the fucking N1 mix they're about there. Offensively baggy is how I would describe all of their attires. No. Bro, adults, we all agree the special Olympics is a good program. I just, it's great. I just feel like the guy who came up with it had to be like a real risk taker. You know what I mean? That's a wild thing to suggest for the first time. There's some guy in a board meeting like, I got an idea. We should be racing these motherfuckers. It's like, what did you say? He's like, fucking town overs said they had the fastest ones. So we settle it, you know. I'm not making fun of the Olympians. The concept is wild. It's a wild, like if you're a best friend in Venice, the special Olympics, and told you about it first, you'd be like, don't ever tell anybody that. Who the fuck are you going to tell that to? What are you doing? Polval? I actually personally, I actually volunteered and coached with the special Olympics for a little while. So, you know, what did you guys do? No, don't clap. Please. I did it for those kids. No, I'm kidding. No. I looked like this. So, me coaching the special Olympics, I was like a fucking double agent. No one knew who side I was on to. Player of chaperones, no one knew. I'd be standing there coaching, holding a clipboard with five dudes that looked exactly like me. You know, see the coaches from the other team looking over like, I think they got, I think they're fucking letting one of them coach the other. Yeah. No, I did coach the special Olympics for a little while, and it's fun. That's another thing you're allowed to talk about. It's happy. Everyone there is sportsmanship. It is funny. Don't let anyone tell you it's not funny, dude. I was there. Everyone there is laughing. It's fun. I coach basketball. Kids would catch the ball and just fucking, just fucking, launch it into the bleachers. They'd be like, what the fuck are you doing out there? I don't know. I was like, I don't know. I was fucking. My whole team ruled. Everybody, every dude on my team was, they were the funniest. They fucking, they were bros. They were bros, dude. My whole team loved two things. They loved tits. They do. I don't know if you know these guys, dude. They fucking loved the ladies. They loved the ladies. And they loved John Cena. That's it. That was the news. Every day. We'd be in the huddle. They'd be like, there's a lot of ladies here tonight. I was like, ooh, yeah. They'd be like, what do you think John Cena's up to? Oh, you're gonna have to get way worse before you meet him. See, John Cena's like the angel of death for those guys. I told my guys. I was like, you see Cena coming. You get the fuck out of there. He's taking souls with him. Every year, hooters would sponsor our one basketball tournament. So every year, hooters would bring like three or four waitresses and they would present like a big cardboard check donation to the Special Olympics. As soon as the girls entered the gym, the game changed. Entirely, dude. It went from like hugs and sportsmanship to just, I dudes got competitive. Like very competitive. Fucking ripping down rebounds. It's hitting my ups. And then at the end of the game, there'd be a hug line. Between the waitresses and the players. And yeah, that went about exactly how you would imagine that one. We had to break out the fucking jaws of life, too. My boys are ragged all those young sluts. And I'm not knocking the players. They were totally in the right. The girls were hot. The waitresses, like every year, I would sneak into the hug line myself. Alright, I think I'm gonna get out of here, guys. Thank you guys very much. She's a lot of fun. Thank you. You
