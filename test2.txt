You know what I'm saying? This is one of the brothers I think in the future. Really, you're gonna see a lot of them. I think the kids gonna blow up, because he has his own style and very, very funny. So that helps. He's from Atlanta, but he lives in LA now. Yo, give it up for my man, Chris Tucker. Oh! Shup, man! This motherfucker! Pistol, man! I am! I'm a fucking mama callin' me for Christmas. I'm on the Christmas gift and shit. I always want some. Someone water, I wanna fuck every time you call. You always want some. How the fuck we just can't talk? You know I ain't got the money until I say I'm broke. Broke is the motherfucker. I'm so broke. If a nigga rob me, he'll just be practicing. I'm gonna get them a pictures and shit down. It's fucked up, man, ain't funny? You can't even be a thief no more. Everybody's a thief. Other day I robbed a stole, came back out, a nigga don't stole my car. I'm damn shit no more. Police arrest me, man, look man, I know I robbed that motherfucker stole my stolen my goddamn car man. Damn. I'm sitting in jail with the motherfucker, didn't even know it. I'm not going to read your full homes. I'll send them a fucking notebook all at a start. The nigga I was getting some. Damn, why you left that I gave you a rob now? Nigga, I didn't know. You was robbing the stole? Fucked up, man. Now when I need money, I'll rob a motherfucker in the middle. I don't care, I rob a motherfucker. One time I'm instant again, rob my mama. I said, let me put your goddamn hands up, put them up. Give me a purse, give me a purse. What you doing my brother's pictures in your pocket book? Chris, over there, I'm sorry, Dan. Chris, I'm gonna walk you down that dog street man. Do you like that shit going on my day? She gonna take me to court. I'm gonna get your purse back there. And I hate robbing motherfuckers. I gotta get friends with cause I don't have a cause. Hate waiting no motherfuckers, man. I hate waiting on people. You ever had somebody call you, tell you they own that way.

And y'all win me, y'all play to get them, y'all play too much, too much. Y'all know y'all play around and they're pushing too much. I'm serious. I took a girl off for like two weeks. She wouldn't give me none. So I took her to court. I want you to justice her, she had to give me the pussy by the A.T. I had a lawyer in everything, did you promise him to push him man? I said bitch, did you promise him to push him? Oh, for the course, that bitch lying, you know what I'm saying? They put me on a stand, Mr. Tucker. Did she promise you to push him man? I said yeah, she promised me to push him. I got emptied McDonald cups in the back seat of my car. That bitch owed me name. I fuck right now in the courtroom, who shut the way? She knew I was gonna win, too. Try to set out a court to my sucky dick if he dropped out of charge. I said no, I know. He's got a three-second peace sign. You should bring it down, Mr. Tucker. You should be. Love her. Funny shit, young brother. Give him another round of applause, you're gonna have a lot from good. Now, I asked you the time I bring my man up stage, Russell Simmons, come on up here, man of public. Fuck you, me. Thank you for coming out. God bless you, good night. Thank you.
Uh-uh-uh-uh! Wait, shit. I'm mad. I'm gonna start right now with him pissed off about it. I'm pissed off about the right-and-a-king business. The latest thing about the shit that bothers me that all the police want to get off, they say they shouldn't have to go to trial because they didn't get a speedy trial that they've been violated. Let me take what pissed me off. Number one, you don't treat humans like that. But secondly, this was really fucked me up. They lied! I'm right in the king. This and right in the king was done a hundred and seventeen miles an hour in a fucking hundie. No, no way. When the fuck you ever seen anybody doing a hundred miles an hour? In a hundie? Let me say this, if you out driving on the freeway and you see somebody who's sipping back at a hundred miles an hour in a fucking hundie, I suggest you get your ass off that freeway. Have a nap because you are fucked up. Got it? The only way... Oh, no! The... The only way you can do a hundred miles an hour in a hundie is if you're going down a steep hill for the fat people with a heavy tail wind. That shit don't happen. It don't happen. And I'm gonna say something, and this is not a racist statement. But only white folks were shocked when they saw that tape. Paul Lee's whooping black folks in a black community ain't no new shit. When I saw that, I thought it was a fucking new timex commercial. I didn't know what the fuck it was. That's fucking it. Shit, I... And I called my man. I called my man just to get them. How come I wasn't up for that? Who is riding the key and why is he getting all the damn work? That's what I wanted up. And in a black man watching that and still driving, you're brave. You got damn brave. I'm scared to drive. I bought a fucking bus pass. I'm scared to drive. If I'm looking to rear view mirror and see the police coming, I start worrying about shit. I did back in sixth grade. I ain't bullshit, man. My mama called. I don't know. And I'm gonna say this, man. Last week, the police made me get out of the car. I scared the shit out of me. I said, like, get off the car. What? What? What? What? What I do, officer? I said, well, you're doing 15 in the 20. 15 in the 20. Yeah, you're going through goddamn slump. So I jumped out the car, grabbed a black jacket, stopped whipping myself. Just whipping myself. See that way you cut out the fucking middle man. See him saying, you just cut it. You just don't know how to do that. You know, you don't need him. Hey, real quick, let me just do a quick check. How many people here do crack besides me? Smoke crack, rich man. One, just one, two. Name by ever smoke crack. I'm smoke that shit no more used to. Anybody used to? Be honest. He come on you, lad. I'm gonna fucking be honest. Get them hands up. Shit, I did crack. That's why I talk about this shit, because I never do it again, but I did a lot. No, no, no, lipp it. I did a lot of crack. I did so much fucking crack one day I broke it in my own fucking house. You mean? I love. I love. I love. You do. All right, but you look. I was halfway. I was halfway out the door with the TV for I realized it was my fucking place. I didn't know. I fucked up. I was bringing. They call it sprung. I was bringing. You know what's sprung here? It's sprung when you turn your life over the crack. You do anything for a piece, wait, I'm sorry. Okay, you'll do anything for a piece of crack. You jump through a plate glass window. If you thought that white, no way man. I'm sorry. If you thought that white smack in the shag rug, was a piece of crack. And when you want crack, everything small and white look like crack to you. Small piece of paper, small piece of limb, small white poodle. You think it's crack? And then people say Michael, how you stay so slim and trim? Shit, I don't man telling you. Crack diet. Crack diet. You ain't losing weight, man. Fuck, Jimmy Crack. You ain't losing weight. Start smoking crack. You will lose weight two ways. Number one, you lose weight because when you smoke crack, you automatically lose your appetite. But secondly, now this way, you really lose the weight is running back and forth to the pawn shop. To sell your shit. One last slice I do want to talk about, um, anybody here fucking besides me, anybody else? All right, do ask them fuckers and then how's good? Because I gotta talk to you about safe sex for one second. I people didn't raise their hand, but I really believe that everybody in this audience, either fucking, or know somebody that is. All I'm talking about right now is protecting the ding-a-link. Not as on a two ways to do this. Only one way is a sure way we call that abstinence. That's right, abstinence. That means completely give up sex. Okay, fuck that. Yeah. Second way. Second way. Make a lot more sense than that is the proper use of a condom. But most people can't even pronounce the word condom. I ain't bullshit, one guy told me was a condom. One guy said, condron. One of course, my favorite word for it is condom. You're not a good man. I'm not a good man. I've been to someone one of my two. I went about two, damn it. Do you practice what you preach safe sex? Do you utilize a condom each and every time you have sex? Hell yeah. Shit, I'm wearing one right now. Come out of here, I'm going back. Yes.
The second time I met O.J. Simpson. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. O.J. Simpson was the most famous or infamous face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn't alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents and celebrating a deal that they told them was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white, and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Our Collins couldn't believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was O.J. Simpson. newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn't mean to say that loud, but it just came out. O.J. You stopped. Turn around and see who said it. Saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with. And shook my hand. How are you, young man? He looked in my eyes and I could see in his eyes that he didn't remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back in my agents and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice the disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. How could you, as she said? How could you shake hands with that murderer? I said, Jim, but I'll do respect it. That murderer ran for over 11,000 years. Now I could be bitter and blame all the police, but now I'll tell you who I blame. I'm still fucking sketch artist. They keep drawing the same brother over and over again. Who is this generic man we all look like? I want to know what they say when it's us. You know, I'm really being that room like, did you get a look? Do you see the guy that tried to rob you? Yes. Yes, I did. He was about six feet tall, I'd say. Six feet tall? Yes. He had his head on backwards too. Good. That's good stuff, huh? He was on backwards. Yes. He was black. Okay, big lips, big nose, dick hanging out. Say no more, sir. Now, draw him from memory. You know, let me get my stencil, I think we can trace this guy and save some time. The only thing I society that bothers me the most is the way that men and women don't get along the wall. That's really what's bugging me about it. Men and women just don't get along. Like I hear women say this all the time. I know a lot of you say, it's like, shivery is dead. Don't you? Don't you feel that way? Like men aren't gentlemen anymore? That's right. Shivery is dead and women killed it. As a fundamental difference in the way we're going to see things, we're not going to see out of Owens issue. We're just not. Our test in life are different. A woman's test in life is material. A man's test in life is a woman. Now, by test I mean that those are the things that we desire. Men have nice cars. Not because they like nice cars because they know women like nice cars. That's how it goes. Because men are hunters and the cars debate. And a woman comes and says, ooh, nice Porsche. Gotcha bitch. That's how it is. That's true. Come on there. You go to a woman's house. Her house would be comfortable as shit. Women love comfortable surroundings. So they can get comfortable surroundings. Let me tell you something. If a man can fuck a woman in a cardboard box, he wouldn't buy a house. But that's still not where shivery got killed. Shivery got killed by the feminist movement on the magazines that got women going crazy. Because women got too much advice about men from other women. And they don't know what the fuck they talk about. It's true. I see the shit in the magazines. I don't read them but I've been seeing the cover. I've been a grocery store fellow. He looked at one of the magazines. I was like, what is this? I was saying a cover. 100 Ways to Please Your Man by Some Lady. Yeah. You know, 100 Ways. This is four things. No, I'm just psychotic. Play with his balls and fix him a sandwich. And don't talk so much. And then the magazines trick the women. The magazines stop picking at your self-esteem. Every page you turn, you start feeling fatter and uglier. And you feel like your clothes aren't good enough. And the magazines have you forgotten how fucking beautiful you are. And that's what happens. Now look what happens. And then you forget how beautiful you are and we all suffer. If pussy was a stock, it would be plummeting right now. Because you flooded the market with it. You're giving it away too easy. I'm just being truthful. I'm just talking. It would plummet. Maybe watching this today pussy plummet again. But I'm a stock. Gold is up 10 points. You can see it. You ever have this happen. This is how confusing it is. This is the practical application when I'm talking about. Like a guy be out. This happens to get out guys. You be out of club. Bar right. He's kicking with your boys. And a girl walks by. And a man she looks good. She looks good. And that's not good in that classical way. I'm talking good. She got half her ass hanging out her skirt. Her titties are all mashed together. Popping out the top of her turtle neck and shit. And he was your buddies, right? You were your buddies. You got a couple of drinks in here. And you see, guys, you might try to talk to it. You might not come out right now. I don't know what you say. Damn, I'm looking at titties. The girl gets mad. Oh, oh, oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just because I'm dressed this way does not make me a whole. Which is true. Gentlemen, that is true just because they dress a certain way. It doesn't mean they are a certain way. Don't ever forget it. But ladies, you must understand that that is fucking confusing. Just the ends. That would be like me. They should pay out a comedian walking around the streets and a cop being a fool. Somebody might run up on me. Oh, thank God. Officer, help us. Come on over here. Help us. I'm not going to let all of them out. Get all. Get because I'm dressed this way does not make me a police officer. You know what I'm saying? I was like, all right, lady, fine. Fine. You are not a whore. But you are. We're in a whore's uniform. I'll tell you that's the way. You're going to miss understanding. Understanding is going to happen. And then, man, we miss understanding women a lot. You know, we always undermine their feelings. You can't do that to them. You can't. Because, see, feelings, this year they clap and feelings are very important to women. They are all important. I'm just learning this shit. Everything is based on how they feel. You can hear when they tell stories. You know, here, man, tell a story. It'll be just facts. Who what? When, where, why? It was me and Bob. We was at Safeway. And then, a nigga, Bob said this. And I pushed that nigga and then I broke out. That's the story. That's the story. Women, tell stories. All these feelings. The first boy he was understanding. I was on my period and I just talked to my mother. So I was feeling like we were like, God, fam, it was too many feelings. The fuck happened? You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. But I gotta talk about it. I gotta talk about it. And that's how they always get me. I've been sitting there watching TV chilling and shit. My old lady come up to me. David, we need to talk. Fuck! I don't say that out loud. That's how I feel inside. Because I know every time we need to talk, we need to talk about some shit that I gotta do. We don't have to talk about anything she needs to do. She leaves me defenseless. I have to do what I have to do. David, we need to talk. Nah. Don't do that to me, David. This is serious. Stop talking in that voice. Now say. I gotta do what I say. Say. Say. You got damn sick of it. This is the worst time ever being a celebrity. You're gonna be finished. Everyone's doomed. Michael Jackson has been dead for 10 years. And this nigga has two new cases. And if you haven't watched that documentary, then I'm begging you. Don't watch it. It's fucking gross. I felt like HBO was sticking baby dicks in my ears before I was straight. Really nasty shit. I wanna know all these things. Turns out Michael Jackson allegedly likes a long gander at the anus. So they say he stays with people's buttholes. That's what they said. That's how gross the documentary was. I'm gonna say something that I'm not allowed to say. But I gotta be real. I don't believe these motherfuckers. I do not believe. But let me qualify the statement. I am what's known on the streets as a victim blamer. You know what I mean? If somebody comes up to me like, Dave, Dave, Chris Brown just beat up Rihanna. I'll be like, well, what does she do? Dave, Michael Jackson was molest the children. Well, what were those kids wearing at the time? I don't think you did it. We know what? Even if you did do it, you know what I mean? I mean, it's Michael Jackson. I know more than half the people in this room have been molested in their lives. But it wasn't no goddamn Michael Jackson. It's just he ain't got his dick sucked by the Kangapak. All we get is awkward thanks-givings for the rest of our lives. You know how good it must have felt to go to school the next day after that shit? Hey, Billy, how was the weekend? How was my weekend? Michael Jackson sucks my dick. And that was my first sexual experience. If I'm starting here, then, oh, sky's the limit. I know it seems harsh, but man, somebody's got to teach these kids. There's no such thing as a free trip to Hawaii. Yeah, he's going to want to look at your butthole or something. You know what I don't believe it? You know I don't believe it? Because Michael Jackson's out here doing all this molesting. Then why not McCulloch Hawkins? McCulloch Hawkins stayed in an interview that Michael Jackson never did anything inappropriate with him or even around him. Think about that shit. You know, I'm not a pedophile. But if I was, McCulloch Hawkins the first kid, I'm fucking, I'll tell you that right now. I'll be a goddamn hero. Hey, hey, hey, hey over there. Fuck the kid from home alone. And you know how hard he is to catch. All our stars, man. Our Kelly pissed on his victim. I know it was rough. But I mean, again, I can't even judge our Kelly. First of all, we don't know if these allegations are true. And that even they are true. If you want to know how I feel about it honestly, if a man cannot pee on his fans, I don't want to be in show business anymore. Because that's why I got in the game. Baby, I got dreams too. You guys are confused in the issue. Why you guys are busy worrying about if our Kelly even peed on this girl or not? You're not asking yourself the real question. That America needs to decide once and for all. And that question is, how old is 15 really? Oh, that's a good question. That's a good question. I'm not saying that a person is as smart as they're going to be at 15. That's not what I'm saying, man. But I am saying 15 to me is old enough to decide whether or not you want to be pissed on. I mean, that's me. If you can't make a decision like that by the time you're 15, then just give up motherfucker because life is way harder than that. I make tougher decisions all the time. If you don't want to get pissed, I want to just get the fuck out of the way. It's not even a decision. If I start peeing on the front row, they're not going to have to calculate and think, how do I feel about this? Am I okay with it? They just move. You can do that at 15. I could have. I bet 15. When I was 15, I was doing stand-up in night clubs. I smoked a rafel from time. I was trying to hang a fuck. I knew what was happening around me to some degree. Getting pissed on was the least of my worries at 15. Trust me. But it keeps coming up. There's a lot of confusion around that age. Any time 15 comes up, people freak out. Like when that girl Elizabeth Smart got kidnapped. Right? Remember when you told last year's 15-year-old girl Elizabeth Smart was kidnapped? And then they finally found her and the whole country was relieved. And I was the only one saying, damn, she wasn't that smart after all. Not because she got kidnapped. That could happen to anybody. I'm not knocking her for that. I'm just saying, if you're kidnapped me when I was 15, you got to take me further than eight miles away from my house. Man, God damn. Can't hold me prison around. Shit, I recognize. I'll break away. I'll break away. Fuck off me. That's my bus stop. I know I'm going home. I'm going home. She was missing for six months, eight miles away from my house. That's two exits, man. That's nothing. And while she was missing during this half a year that this girl was missing, this is a seven-year-old black girl gets kidnapped and fill a delphia. Nobody knows her name. They might have talked about a two or three times on the news, but she should have been the top store. Because she chewed through the ropes and had both of these motherfuckers in jail. And 45 minutes flat. Seven years old. I'm not making this up. There's two crack heads kidnapped and took them back to the crack house and tied her up. And then they left her. There's a crack heads. I got to make moves, crack smoke, chocolate, eat. These motherfuckers made moves. It was out. But as soon as they left, this little girl got the nibbun. She was kidnapped at four o'clock. And at home, watching herself on news at 5.30. That shit is crazy. That's a news store. That is a news store. Now, meanwhile in Utah, 15-year-old Elizabeth's smarts captors left her alone too. And they didn't even tie her up because they're here at Bill East. They just bounced. Don't try to escape, bitch, or will kill you. Be right back. They're leaving. And she's 15 sitting in the house by herself. How am I going to get out of this? Come on, Elizabeth, think. Think Elizabeth, how am I going to get out of here? Why don't you just open the fucking door and go outside? Have you thought about that? Do you have a quarter? Do you know your phone number? Your 15-inch run? Stop thinking and stop making moves. I know I sound mean. And I know what the people are thinking when I'm saying this day, she's only 15. All right. But that's the discrepancy because when you talk about a little girl like Elizabeth's smart, then the country feels like 15 is so young and so innocent. On the flip side, here comes 15 again. Now we talk about a 15-year-old black kid in Florida. This black kid accidentally killed his neighbor when he's practicing wrestling moves that he saw on TV. Now, was he a kid? Oh. They gave him light. They always try our 15-year-olds as adults. The sneaker, nobody was doing. So God damn pile driver. This kid gets on the ropes, there's no stopping him. You'd have to send a rock to a restaurant. And they gave a 15-year-old boy life and jail. If you think that it's okay to give him life and jail, then it should be legal to pee on him. That's all I'm saying. You got to make up your mind across the board. How old 15 actually is? That's all I'm saying. So I'm going to tell you right now, if somebody comes in here and puts a gun in my head and says, Shepale, you got a choice to make. You're either going to jail for a month or we'll let you go. But you got to let R. Kelly pee on you. I'm not hesitating. Bringing R. Kelly and telling him to stay away from my ass. I'd rather get pissed on on the outside and fucking the butt on the insides. I can't go to jail with some smooth Botox balls and think everything's going to be alright. It's not that kind of place. Taking my chance with that pissed-a-wash-off with a 10-minute shower, I'm certain of it. This piss is coming right out. What can I do? They're going to put me in jail. Too much pressure. That's my problem. I can't handle pressure. Sometimes pressure makes me talk different. I'm serious. You ever have that social pressure? You ever talk to somebody who's fake and they make you fake? Like, that kind of thing. Hey, how you doing? You're like fine, are you? I don't even talk like that. I get sick of that shit. That makes me sick. Sometimes I talk crazy just to make myself feel better. You know, do that. It's not talking like crazy. I never heard his voice. That's how bad guys use to talk in the 40s. In the old days, say, I talk like that. Now all the time, if somebody put depression on me, I got to cut loose. Maybe the police pulled me over. I talk crazy. Son, son. Do you know why we hold you over? Nah, because I'm black, see? That's right. Bang! I do it. It's not illegal to talk like that. How they know I don't talk like that every day. Stop talking like that. Stop talking like white cover. Hey. Try to talk, see? You got to make life interesting like that, because the shit is flimsy. Life is flimsy. You think you're going to live forever? It's dangerous out here. We know what's going on. I travel now. You know, I just think DC had the roughest ghettos in the country. Nah, they go, oh. I have seen some shit now. Oh, there's some rough, rough areas outside of DC. Yeah, everybody should go to the ghetto. I was taken to the ghetto one time. That's the worst. When you get taken to the United, expecting to go? Usually you want to know when you're going to get it. Like, I'm going to see some loud shit. I'm going to see some crazy. When you're taken, it's different. I had a limousine driver. It was after a show, it was late at night. It was like three in the morning. I had a limousine driver. He was a nice guy. I'd talk to him and shit, oh, hey, where are you from, dawg? DC? Where? That's a rough city, man. And his cell phone started ringing. Hold on a second. Hello? Oh, something, nigga. What? What the fuck? Slow down. No. No. No. Fuck that. Nigga, fuck it. I'm on my way. Woo. I gotta make a stop real quick. At three o'clock in the morning, I didn't know he was taking me to get it with first. That's how I look at the winner. I was like, what the fuck? Gunstore? Gunstore? Gunstore? Gunstore? Gunstore? Gunstore? It's not look good. He didn't say shit. Just pulled up in front of my old, Ricky building. That looked like a project. Now, I'd never been there before. I'm not sure if it was a project, but it certainly had all the familiar symptoms of a project. Fucking crackhead ran this way. And then another one jumped out of tree and shit. And then I said, I'll be right back. And left me. Took the keys with me. Just left me. At three o'clock in the morning, in front of a project, in a fucking limousine. This was not good. I was like, man, I gotta look around and see if I can see some landmarks. And figure out where I'm at. I have to escape on foot. Now, this is when I knew I was in a bad neighborhood. You only see this in the worst neighborhoods. Remember, it's three o'clock in the morning. It's three o'clock in the morning. I look out the window. It was a fucking baby standing on a corner. It was. And the baby, the baby didn't even look scared. He was just standing there. I mean, it made me sad. It made me sad, really. I mean, because I wanted to help the baby. Well, I don't trust you either. I'm sorry. Quick. The old baby on the corner, trick, eh? You're not gonna fall for that shit. Where is this limousine, drive me? You know, I stop feeling bad. It's time goes by, I stop feeling worse. I said, man, what is wrong with me? What the hell is wrong? I'm scared of a baby. This baby could be in trouble. He might need my help. I gotta do something. But I wasn't going to get out the car. I'm serious, man. I was packed and went in there a little bit. It was the old limousine. I could roll it down. Hey, baby. Baby, go home. Man, it's three o'clock in the morning. What the fuck are you doing up? The baby said, I'm seven weeks, and they gots at home. I want to respect it in. I'm sorry I had to buy two bags from the car. I don't get to, I don't get to. I'm gonna get to the car. I got back in the car and rolled me a joint, man. That shit was scary, man. Every once in a while, like a crackhead will come up to the car and looking to win, it was like Jurassic Park and should he be looking on the car? Get out of here, crackhead. That baby was still standing there, man. That's not feeling bad again. Yeah, we make it feel guilty sometimes. What is wrong with me, man? I have just bought weed from an infant. I can't condone this kind of behavior. What am I thinking? I can't let the fear ruin my morals. Gotta do something. Hey, baby. Stop selling weed, alright? You got your whole life ahead of you. You say, fuck you. Look, I can't see you. That's a guy. Can't do everything. Baby weed. You're gonna do something. Do a little weed. Weed. Weed's not as bad as everything else. It's weed is a background substance. You can smoke some herb and still function. You ain't crisp. But your function. Nothing higher than weed, though. I made that mistake one time. I said, a party's him. I gave him some shit. He said, here, man, take this. It's fucking mushrooms. I took it. I forgot all about it, you know. A couple days later, I found that shit in my pocket. I'm thinking, why not? Because I'm thinking it's like weed. Some background shit. I planned my whole day out like it was weed. I'll chew this shit up. Then I go to the barber shop, give my head cutting, and then I'll see a movie. I chewed it up so far, so good. Then I was in a barber shop, like an hour later. It's funny because I was just thinking to myself, I was like, this stuff sucks. Tastes like a head-least foot. I feel sick, but I'm not really high. Then I looked in the mirror. I saw the barber's reflection, man. It looked like a big penis was cutting my head. I freaked out. I started talking to myself, Dave, calm down. Here on drugs. This is what drugs do. You know that there is no way that a penis can cut hair. I started freaking out, man. I just couldn't take it anymore. I jumped out the chair, half my hair was cut. I didn't care. I had a dinner. I just gave a barber a handful of money. It was weird. The balls opened up. Anyway, I ran home, man. I ran home as fast as I could. It was tripping. I looked at the clock. It was 2.42. I was like, damn, 2.42. I got a sober up. I had never been this high, this early. I took a shower. I was still high. Said maybe musical do the trick. I listened to every CD I had. I was still high. Exercise. That's what I'll do. I ran around the box. Four times. Still high. Took a nap, woke up, fucked up. I looked at the clock. It was 2.43. I said, God, Dave. But there's more important reason that I would stop doing comedy right now. And this reason is the real reason that's been percolating. And it really is the crowd. Not you. I'm talking about the crowd on the big stage. It's too hard to entertain a country whose ears are so brittle. Motherfuckers are so sensitive, the whole country is turned into bitch ass niggas. Everybody you say upset somebody. But motherfuckers are just taking it too far. I don't know why or how everybody got this goddamn sensitive. You know who hates me the most, the transgender community. Yeah, these motherfuckers. I mean, I didn't realize how bad it was. These motherfuckers are really mad about that last Netflix special. It's tough, man. I don't know what to do about it because I like them. I always have. Never had a problem with them. You know, just fucking around. And that effect, I think I make fun of everybody. And I mean, as a group of people they have to admit, it's kind of fucking hilarious, man. I'm sorry, bro. I've never seen somebody in such a hilarious predicament not have a sense of humor about it. They're born feeling like there's something other than they're born as a net. That's kind of funny, you know what? It's funny if it's not happening to you. I believe transgenders. I don't understand them either, but I know they mean what they say. The niggas cut their dick off. That's all the proof I need. I've seen somebody just throw their dick away. Don't need it. I don't understand, but I believe you when I support your decision motherfucker. There's a problem in that feminist movement, isn't there? From its inception in America, there's always been a racial component. When Susan Beanley was having that meeting and sojourner Truce Black-ass showed up, read your history books. All the white women asked sojourner Truce not to speak. They didn't want to conflate the issues of women's rights and slavery. But you know how black bitches are? Sojourner Truce went up there anyway. She did a famous speech. She said, ain't I a woman? Ain't I a woman? That's right. And listen, listen, listen. I supported the Me Too movement. But the whole time, the whole time, I thought the way they handled that was stupid. It was. It was white. It was like, they were doing shit like going to the Golden Gloves and all of them would be like, let's all go to the Golden Gloves and wear black dresses to give these men a piece of our minds. Bitch, that is not going to work. You think, my mother's the king's going to be like, I want everybody to keep riding the bus, but wear matching outfits. You got to get off the bus and walk. It was real talk. It was a real talk. It was a silly movement. I want everybody to wear a crochet and push their hats so they know where serious. Who fuck was he all doing? And then I said, somebody bought it from one of my specials and all these women actresses came after me. I said, man, fuck y'all too, you can't. I ain't jerking off the none of your pictures again. They were like, who is he to tell us anything? I'll tell you exactly who I am. I am the one that got off the bus and left 50 million dollars on the bus and walked. I agreed with these women. I just didn't agree with what they were doing about. Right, right. No, it was annoying as fuck. Because if these women were serious, you know what they would have done? They all would have fired their agents. And they would have went to the mail room of one of these big agencies and found a woman that was busing her up and then said, if you want to talk to us, then you have to talk to her. And if they did that, then she would be big and they would be big and nobody would get fed the Harvey Weinstein. But did they do that? No. Was that their idea? No. Surprisingly, it was mine. What I think the feminist movement needs to be very successful is a male leader. I'll do it. I will. I will lead you women to the promised land. I will make sure you get equal pay, equal work. I will make sure that nobody harasses you. Well, fucks with you on the job. I will protect all of your interests and all that I ask for in return. Was that you sucked my dick? Tell me was one of my first white friends like in my life, man. Good dude, too. He moved to Silver Spring from Utah of all places. I guess his family was affiliated with that Mormon church they got down there. I mean, him used to hang out. And one day I was at his house, we were just hanging out and Timmy says, Dave, why don't you stay for dinner tonight? I said, oh man, I'd love to, but I can't. If I'm not home before dark, my mother will kill me. That was a lie. My mother had several jobs. I hadn't seen her like three or four days. And the only reason I lied to Timmy was because at that point in my life, it was my experience that white dinner wasn't delicious. I'd rather go home and fry some baloney or some shit like that. But then old Timmy threw me a curveball. I wasn't expecting. He said, oh, it's too bad you can't stay, Dave, because my mom made stove top stuffing. I said, what the fuck stove top? Oh, no, nigga, let me make some phone calls real quick. I had seen that commercial so many times. I had dreamt of getting my hands on some of that stove top stuffing. And finally, I met a mother fucking that actually had a box of stove top in the house. I couldn't miss this opportunity. So I pretended to call my mother. And then I came back and I said, Timmy, Timmy, you're not going to believe this great news. Mom said, I can stay. And he said, fantastic. He said, why don't you come with me and we'll help set the table and then we can say the blessing. I had no interest in setting this mother fuckers table of saying these crazy ass Mormon prayers. I just wanted to goddamn stuffing. So I told Timmy, I said, you know what? I'd love to help. I'll wash my hands first. My plan was simple. Wash my hands slowly and by the time I'm done, the table will be sent. The blessing will be said and all that there will be left to do is eat. I went to the bathroom. I washed my hands very slowly. I must have been in there for about ten minutes. And suddenly, one of his mothers came to the door. She was like, hi, David, right? I said, yes, ma'am. She said, Timmy tells me that you're planning on staying for dinner. I said, I hope that's not a problem, ma'am. She says, no, it's no problem. In fact, we'd love to have you. It's just that we weren't expecting company. And I'm afraid there's not enough stove top stuffing for everybody. So I kicked her in the pussy. Bam! Ladies and gentlemen, I told you I'm dope, nigga. I told you I was gonna say it and you still didn't see it coming. And that's why I make the big box. No, I feel real bad for is Indians. Everybody feels bad for Indians. They get doled openly. Because everybody thinks they're dead. These motherfuckers are not all dead, all right? I've seen with my own eyes, I've seen a gathering of 1500 Native Americans. They were all gathered in one place. The place is called Walmart, New Mexico. Who's Indians? I've never seen Indians before. I wasn't even sure if they were Indians. I just fucked up, but I asked one of them. It's not nice, but I seen them in the sports section looking at bows and arrows. I had to say something. Oh, excuse me. I don't mean to be rude. Are you Indian? And he was cool. Yes. Yes, I am Indian. Still didn't believe him. I had to test him to be sure. This is fucked up. But I had a gum wrapper in my pocket. I had a gum wrapper and I had to get it all that shit up. And I threw it on the floor. And a single tear came out of his ass. Oh, shit. I had so many questions. What trap are you from? I am a Navajo. I said, it worked. I studied you in social studies. You're a hunter-gatherer, correct? I said, I guess so. That's what you wish to call it. I said, why, what are you calling? He said, I am an alcoholic. I said, what's your name, dog? He said, please. Dog is my cousin. That's a good guess. My name is Ronan Coyote. What is your name, friend? And that shit called me off-guard. I didn't want to say my name was Dave, two motherfuckin' name, Ronan Coyote. He just don't feel good enough. He was putting me on the spot. I said, huh? My name's black. Oh, my name's Blackfeet. Then I changed the subject. Forget about me, what's going on with you? I want to meet your chief. Why don't you and your chief and your friends get together tonight? We could have a real-life piecepipe smoke and ritual. We need to celebrate. And I thought you were dead. And he set it up. It was beautiful. It was just like I dreamed. It was all sitting around. And then he was beating the drum. Other Indians came out the back with a long blanket that was folded in half and puttin' in front of us. Open that shit up, and on the blanket was a long wooden pipe with feathers. And bags of weed all over the blanket. Chief walked over. The big ones are 50. The little ones are 25. And these are 10. And the big ones are 50. And they were all 50. The men of Indians got high as shit. I was beggined. I told the chief. He was talking. I cut him off. Time out, chief. Sorry in the rough. Fucking smashed, man. The weeds too strong. And the chief threw some water in my face. Calm down, black face. Splash! I said, hey, it's black feet, motherfucker. Take it easy. Black feet. You're welcome to stay amongst me and my tribe for the night until the spirits leave you. And they gave me my own TP to sleep in. Which sounds nice. I personally felt like it was a little fucked up. Because they all had houses, man. It's like, why can't I sleep with you all in the house and watch TV? I can't be on this great. Now, I was hanging out with a friend of mine. He's a white guy. We were just hanging out. And we were lost in the city. You know, we smoked in a joint. Now, I don't know if it's a coincidence that we were lost in the high end shit. My wife, but he was smoking to join in. Dave, Dave, Mr. Goddamn cops. I'm going to ask him for directions. I said, chip, no, chip, don't do it. It was too late. He was walking over to this man with high shit. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Touching him and shit. Excuse me. Need some information. It's not confessing things. You shouldn't confess. I'm a little high. All I want to know, which way is third street? The cop was like, hey, take it easy. You're on third street. You better be careful. Go ahead, move it. Move it. That's all that happened. That's the end of the story. Now, I know that's not amazing to some of you. But you have one of these black fellas. That shit is fucking incredible, isn't it? I'm saying, a black man will never dream of talking to police high. That's a waste of weed. That's a waste of weed. Who's that? Seriously. I'm obviously going to talk to police when I'm sleepy. It's fucking around and get the wrong ideas. Oh. Oh, my God. That nigga was on PCP Johnson. No, no, no paperwork. Just sprinkle some crack on him. Let's get out of here. That's how it is, but at the time I didn't think was anything racial about it. I was just like, man, Chip, you got fucking lucky, but I'll be careful. But then another time, me and Chip are driving. Now I'm not driving. Chip is driving and he's driving a little crazy. He's been drinking. I don't like to let my friends drive drunk, but you know, I was smoking a joint. I couldn't really say shit to the guy. We get it a red light. We stop it a red light and the car pulls up next to us and I'll never forget it. Chip, he looks at me as old drunk as he's like, Dave. I'm gonna race him. I knew it was a bad idea, but I was hot. I tried to explain to him it was a bad idea, but all that came out was, well, I think it's sometimes a guy race, I don't know. Man, bad light turned green and Chip took off. He's hanging in the ship so no one could pass him. I don't know how to know he was racing. Then the police seen us and pulled us over. I'm scared of shit. I mean, come on. The cosmo was like, we've been speeding this man as fucking drunk. I'm scared. Chip was not scared at all. It was weird. He didn't turn his radio down. I mean, if you could put over when you turn your radio down, nobody would get their ASB to a soundtracking shit. I'm saying, Chip had the music blasting, we're not gonna take it. What are the numbers that Dave just relaxed? Close your butt cheeks. Relax. Let me do the talking. You want to know what he said? He's almost exactly what he said. I kind of believe it. He says, oh, sorry officer, I didn't know I couldn't do that. I was fucking shocked. The cops said, well now you know, just get out of here. Just get the fuck out of here. Chip said, okay, I will sir. Thank you. What? What's wrong with you Dave? I didn't know I couldn't do that. He said that was good, wasn't it? Because I didn't know I couldn't do that. I'm not for abortion. I'll shut up nigga. I'm not for it, but I'm not against it either. It all depends on who I get pregnant. I don't care what your religious beliefs are or anything. If you have a dick, you need to shut the fuck up on this one. Seriously. This is theirs. The right to choose is their unequivocal rights. Not only do I believe they have the right to choose, I believe that they shouldn't have to consult anybody except for a physician about how they exercise that right. Gentlemen, that is fair. And ladies, to be fair to us, I also believe if you decide to have the baby, a man should not have to pay. That's fair. If you can kill this motherfucker, I can at least abandon him. It's my money, my choice. And if I'm wrong, then perhaps we're wrong. Just fake that shit out for yourselves. I mean, really, what the fuck are we doing? I can't live in this new world you're proposing. And meanwhile, I worry about all this other shit. Look at what's happening. They just killed another 12 people and mass-shooting Virginia Beach. This is happening every week. It happens so much. I'm almost out-candy-more. I came home early from the road. I had a 12,000-dollar suit on because ice been going good. And I got home early and dinner was cooking. You ever come home and dinner's cooking? Then it smelled good. And my son saw me and he was like, dance home. And he got up from the table and ran over to give me a hug. But he had chicken grease all over his face. So I stepped on him and I'm like, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, my man, my man. Watch these threads, son. It's an expensive suit. I don't want you to get the chicken grease all over me. And he was like, what the chicken grease? Damn, this is duck. Tear came out of my ass. I never dreamt I'd do so well in life that I'd raise a nigga with duck grease all over his face. It's one time racism saved my life, man. I was on a plane. I was coming from overseas. And I don't know how this guy got a machine gun on the plane. But he stood up, man. He said, everybody, get on me fucking ground. Nobody look at my face. I started freaking out because he was Chinese. I was like, well, how's he talking like that? He was screaming and crying. I was the only brother on the plane. Well, I thought I was the only brother. I looked over. It was one of the black dudes. He was from Nigeria. I looked over them. He was looking right in my face, man. He didn't say two words to me. He just looked at me. He was like, pff. He didn't need to talk. I know we just were talking. I looked right back in. So my dudes on the front of the plane seen us. They were like, oh my god. I think those black guys are going to try to save us. We were just communicating that we understood the situation. We were both seeing the same thing. What we understood was simple. Paris don't take black hostages. That's the truth. I have yet to see one of us on the news. Readin' the house is that, isn't it? They are treating us good. We are chilling as shit. I like to give a shout out to Ray Ray and Big Steve and Justin Luke for us. You're not going to see it. And terrorists are smart. They know what they're doing there. They're terrorists. They know what black people's bad bargaining chips. They call the White House. Hello. We have got five blood. Hello. You'll be back in DC. You know what I'm going to say, man? This is an election year. I'm asking you, your wife, do you know who you're voting for yet? Don't know, do you? Now you see that? You see what just happened here? Let me tell you something. That is a cultural thing. He knows who is going to vote for. He's just not going to tell me. I've noticed that. That is a cultural thing. Why people do not like to talk about their political affiliations? It's a secret. You know, that's why I always want to vote for you. Hey, Bob, Bob, who are you going to vote for? Take it easy now. Take it easy. So anyway, I was fucking my wife and a rat. And I mean, it was something else. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But who are you voting for? Dave. Dave, come on with the voting. I'm trying to talk about the fucking my wife here. Ask me all these personal questions. They don't like to divulge that information because it matters to them. Black people talk about that shit. Black people will openly talk about politics. Black people will openly talk about beating up politicians as shit. I see George Bush, our kickers motherfucking ass for cutting my Medicaid. Oh, okay, let me go and say it. I would just say it. But there's a reason for that. There's a matter is more for the matters more. People see, it's even when I vote, right? Which I don't. But, but, but even when I think about like who I would vote for, right? I don't even look at their political policies. I just look at their character. You know what I'm saying now? You got to read. No, I'm serious. You got to read. Between the lies. You know, you look at Clinton and white people like Clinton because we've seen him on a camp. That's all one thing on a campaign trail. He actually just picked up black baby up and kicked me. Come here little nigga baby. Oh, I like that. He did not have the pain or nothing. You see George Bush doing it. He being in. Like see, I had never vote for George Bush Jr. But I don't know George Bush Jr.'s politics. I don't think I know about George Bush Jr. is that that guy sniff cocaine. That's right. Now listen, we cannot have that shouldn't a white house. That might be fine for a mayor, but God damn it, not my house. Right there. I'm saying. The states are too high in the white house. Can't have no coke here, president. Maybe selling nuclear seekers for $20, $30 in shit. Could be a meetings in Barrison America. Come on. Sound a treaty baby. I suck your dick like what? You missed it. You're welcome.
I'm gonna talk about universal. Okay? For those of you around the world, out here in LA, there's two theme parks. You have Disney Land, right? Which is the one you want to go to. All right? They know, I'm gonna sit down for this so you guys know that this is coming from the heart. Okay? So anyway, universal, it's like they make, they're making shit on the lot and then up top the people that go to their movies, they have all of these fucking rides that you go on. So every once in a while, a new ride opens up and if you have kids, your kids want to go on it. So the new Mario World ride opened up and we went there and my wife, my wife, I don't know what she did. Like she always buys the VIP shit. She goes, don't worry. She goes, we have the VIP, you know, we can just fucking go in. But our VIP shit didn't count on the new ride. They're like, yeah, that doesn't count. Like what are we talking about? We pay the next 100 bucks per ticket. They're like, yeah, that's for the other rides. You know? Do you remember Joe Dirt? Do you remember that? The Joe Dirt Ride. You can get on that shout out to David Spade. The Joe Dirt Ride. It's a fucking 69 Super B that does a loop-d loop. You can say, I don't want to fucking go on that. Well, you wouldn't have to stand in line. There's no one in that line. You asshole. It's a fucking movie from 30 goddamn years ago. We have the tango and cash fucking water ride. It's good for that. But any of this new shit. So we go into like Mario World. And the first thing we got there early, we stand in line for this fucking ride, dude. It was two hours and 40 minutes to get on the fucking ride, dude, every time you thought you'd gone up the last flight of stairs and gone into the last room they had. And there was no refreshments, no nothing. So people are getting dehydrated. And then they keep bringing you outside of the structure. And I'm going, you know, this one of those fights you don't want to have with your wife in that line. Because there's no, you can't walk away, right? You're just standing there. You don't want to start anything. And I'm just sitting there thinking, like, want to fuck? Didn't you get the fucking goddamn shit? You know, you always know where the best shit is. How did you fuck this up? Right? I was like the dad and poltergeist. You know, you moved the grade stones, but she didn't move the bodies. Why? That's what I wanted to do. You got VIP tickets, but it didn't count on this shit, right? So two hours and 40 fucking minutes standing in line. It was so bad in the beginning. I actually, I felt for everyone around me going, like, how can you do this to these hard work and Americans? This is fucking terrible. They run a business like this. People come here, they're with their kids. People are crying. Within an hour of that, I just hated everybody. And I was like, you know what? These fucking people deserve it. Look at it. A bunch of fat fucks standing here. Fucking constant pharma. They cut us. They did this thing where they sort of saw how long the line was. And they'll say it was going all the way that way. They sort of got to, like, you know, only like five or 10 groups of people. And they kind of went like, is that the line? Is that like the line? And then they were just fucking in it. And like, that was like an hour of my life. Go, why didn't I say anything? You know, I didn't say anything because they all outweighed me by at least 120 pounds. Yeah. Morbidly. Morbidly obese in their 20s. Primary their life, you know, should be running down the beach like they're in Baywatch carrying that little thing, whatever that thing was for. Like, what was that thing? That little football? I'm in the ocean. That's what I'm going to hang on to. You're going to put it in your teeth and fucking swim back with your big fucking heavy fake 90s titties. Like, we're not going to go down to the ground. It might as well put cement shoes here, right? We went with another dad and his kid. And his kid and our 50 minutes in was just hanging over. The fucking banister thing. And he's going, this is the most boring thing ever. It was like bombing and stand up for two hours and 40 straight fucking minutes. I remember one point I was sitting up on the thing because I finally had to sit down. And I was up on the top thing and I was sitting there. And I saw somebody walking down dressed as Super Mario. And I'm like, I know this bitch is going to tell me to get off this fucking thing. And I am not moving. And she just came up. She said, excuse me. Excuse me. Can you not sit on the chair? Could you not bring relief to your lower back after this ungodly wait for three and a half minutes of a semi-good time? It's why I love my wife. She was sitting on the lower one. And I was sitting there. And the dab we were with was looking at us, waiting to acknowledge the authority. And neither one of us did. And she just kept walking. Could you not sit on the chair? Could you just sit down? Just sit down. And she never did anything and we never fucking moved. I just looked at guys. I'm not fucking moving. What are you going to do? Throw me out and end this? So we finally get into like this room. And I go, hey, everybody, hey, hey, hey, hey, I fucking do it. And they bring us like a whole group of us. They're like, come on, everybody. I see space. I see space. Keep walking in. All right, we're looking at trash compactor things. From the movie you guys like, right? The fucking Star Wars. Right? Yeah, fucking. Yeah, buddy. Fucking Star Wars, man. Fucking live long with Chewbacca in your buck rod, your beanie, beanie shit, right? So there will be one person that comes up. Oh, let's Star Trek. They do that in Star Trek. All right? Star Trek has made the force be with you. Is that how you do it? Oh, wait, that's Hitler. It's hard. It's hard to keep him all, keep track of all of them. So we get in this fucking room. And then this poor woman, right? She's got like the drive through microphone. She's like, all right, everybody's in. OK. And we've been waiting for two hours and 40 minutes. And she has the fucking balls to go, all right? You guys ready to ride? The Super Mario ride? And the parents are like, yeah. Yes, we are. That was the entire purpose of this exercise. And you know the deal. When somebody says, are you ready? No matter how much she say you're ready, it's never enough, right? So we're standing there. She's like, oh, come on. This is the Super Mario ride. You can do better. Are you ready to ride the Super Mario ride? And everybody's like, with the last bit of fucking hydration we have in our body. Well, I, yeah. Yes, we are. Tell me where the dick is, and I will suck it. Please let this part of my life end, right? And then guess what happens? Nothing. Nothing, because the ride has not arrived on the other side. So now she has to fill her bust, and she's not good at it. Going like, this ride took over 75 fucking hours to whatever the fuck she was saying. And then it ends, and she starts again. All right, I hear it. I hear it. And she's like, are you guys ready? I remember there was this giant guy with this head that weighed as much as my body. And I could see him standing over everybody. And he was, I just saw this side of his face in the complete lack of synapses firing. And he's like squinting. And she was going like, are you fucking ready? Are you ready to get on the fucking Mario ride? And he was just like, he just opened his mouth and exhale. And he was like, ah! Right. And then she didn't. And she had the balls, the fucking cajones, to do it again. And he was like, hey, say you fucking ready. And finally, this one dead, who the only person with self-esteem left just went like, yeah, we've been waiting for two and a half fucking hours. He didn't say fuck. And she had the balls to be like, what? And he goes, we've been waiting for two and a half hours. And I hated myself that I didn't say, yeah. Exactly. What do you think we're doing here? This is a horrible experience. Not worth the wait. We realized that in our in 10 minutes in, but there was no way to get out. We were just surrounded. And there was metal on both sides. Just like the Ron Burgundy. I'm trapped in a glass house. How about motion? So finally, we get in there. We go into another fucking room. They close the door. And this fucking guy's talking. I can't even, at this point, I don't even remember what happened. Then we went to the final last thing. It's like, OK, this is where you got to put the thing on. And then put the glasses on. And then you got to fucking, this is shooting and all of this stuff. And then we got on. And it was like, fucking three and a half minutes. And the whole, that's it. And the whole fucking thing was over. And we, in there, I couldn't tell what I was shooting at and all this type. But I don't play, I'm not a video game guy. You know what I mean? I drank beers. I fucking hung out with the fellas. I could throw a ball. All right. I lived my childhood outside in reality. I didn't stay inside, friendless, jerking off, pretending. I was a Navy SEAL. Playing Siphon filter. Well, actually, I played that game. We ended up getting out of there, right? I'm trying to work on not cursing in front of my kids. And we sat down to eat a crusty burger. That the Simpsons part of the park. And I finally, my wife's going like, so do you want to go down and go on the Jurassic? Jurassic fucking Velassarometer fucking ride. And I just couldn't hold it anymore. I go, I'm fucking wiped. I can't. I still want to do this anymore. Like, you know, if this is like the end of the relationship, I'm actually, I don't know if I haven't in me to like save it. And if you just want to meet some other guy here with mouse ears that has a little better attitude about this type of things, like, I'm sure we can work on a financial settlement, but I am fucking out of here. Like, I can't, I literally can't fucking do this anymore. Oh, it's great when you leave. When you leave, they're like, fuck you. You got to go all the way out this way where all the fatties come in. They've got this wide berth. And you just got to walk all the way. You see in the shrubbery, it's so bad, because you can see like civilization. Like, oh, my god, look at those houses that have air conditioning and stuff. You should fucking just walk it out. But the best part was we got home. And like, my daughter fell asleep and everything, and she came in and her Nana was there. And she was like, how was it? And she was just like, it was unbelievable. And she totally flipped out and everything. I was like, all right, thank god. So it was worth it. So in a way, that was an endorsement. So.
Everybody, I was thinking about the first time like Congress had to come up with age of consent. I had to be like the powdered wigs and stuff that had to be a rough day for the fellas. It's like some guy coming up first like from Rhode Island, 12 and I was like, ew, ew, no dude. I don't know why I had to go first on this one. It's like the hardest one to go first on. No, I don't like that. Just talking shit. It's exciting. I was a little too excited. I panicked and got this haircut. What an insane fuck up. My hair was fine. It was totally fine. And then two days ago I was like, I gotta salvage this. It's crazy that I thought my hair was, I was like, if I fix my hair I'll look good. That was the final piece of the puzzle. For me. There's a Dominican barbershop by my house in New York. I'm thinking the first white guy that's ever been in there. I was basically Christopher Columbus of this barbershop and they fucked me up dude. Don't get, if you're white don't get a Dominican haircut. You end up just looking more racist. It was nice though. He kept trying to reassure me the whole time. He was like, no man, it's good. It's all like, it comes in your head. It's good. It's like, oh thank you. Whatever. Fuck this haircut. How are you guys? Fuck. It's good. It's good. I'm happy. It's nice. Everybody's back inside all that shit. I don't know. I had a good, I like to go. I had a nice time. I live in New York so I left. I went back to my parents house. Because I have white privilege. Some people didn't get to leave the city. I did because of my privilege and I used it. You got to use it. You know what I mean? Doesn't feel more disrespectful to wasted. You know what? Then we're all just being racist for nothing. All right. But no, it's good. I went home. My parents, I went with them and over 10 years they got old. Their old is fucking. It's milk though. I'm back on milk. I'm fucking crushing milk lately. I got fucking milk fat this year. It's a weird time in life to have a milk renaissance. It's 33. But it was nice. I think my favorite part of the year was I got to watch my dad watch the news. There's a rough year for my dad and the news. He's a Fox News guy. Don't do that. It's fine. Also I see you guys. Most of you have Fox News dads. How dare you deny your fathers. That's a good dad. I don't watch Fox, but that's a good Fox News mom. That's bad. You don't want a Fox News mom. That's a bad mom. She smokes in the house. But a Fox News dad, that's a good fucking dad. Can you imagine if you had a fucking MSNBC dad? There's some guy every night at dinner like we need to start focusing on renewable energy. It's like, ew, dude. I didn't know dad was gay. Talking about solar panels like a fucking lady. He might add a straight as hell. Dude, we fucking hate the environment. That's how straight we are. Oh, we talk about us eating pussy and fracking. We hate nature. We go fishing. We don't even eat fish. Dude, we just catch them and fucking. No, he's good. He likes, he watches Fox. He watches it every night. Like every Fox News dad. My dad watches Fox every night until he can't. That's how long they watch. They watch every night until they get so angry they have to go to bed. My dad watch for like two hours and then out of nowhere, he'll just stand up and be like, fucking Mr. Potato heads. Trance, I'm going to bed. Who else's going to hell? He's all about it, dude. Like every Fox News dad, my dad watches Fox with one goal. He's just trying to get one fact. It's all he's doing. He's sitting there, he's trying to retain one piece of information that he can then relay to whoever's unlucky enough to enter the living room while he's watching. And you think it'd be easy to get one fact, but every once in a while there's like a commercial for like a commemorative 9-11 gold coin. Just fucking wipes their hard drive. I was like, what was I watching? I got one of those, I got my hands on those patriotic coins. My dad drinks too, so he can never, he can never get a fact. Ever. You'll come in the living room and be, he's hammered watching the news every night, which is the wildest way to take in world politics. Like just hammered on a recliner like, whoa. It's like footage of rocket attacks in Israel. He's like, whoa. The hell are they doing over there? What's these guys problem? But he can never get a fact. Like he tries, he tries, he uses Fox News as like a PowerPoint for what he's trying to say. Like everyone, like we'll be eating dinner and like, Hannity, he'll be saying something. He's like, see? That's what I meant. Look at that. That's me talking. I can't say it that good. You can never get a fact. You'll walk in the living room, he's been watching the news for three hours. He'll be like, all right, what's going on in the world? He's like, you want to know? I'll tell you, fucking Nancy Pelosi's a bitch. That's like, all right. Settle down, dude. That was the news last, that's the news every night for my dad. It's just like breaking. You know Nancy Pelosi's a bitch? I was like, yeah, yeah. I had a feeling. But like everything they say he agrees with. He's all in. I realize like Fox News is basically black church for old white dudes. You know what I mean? Like literally everything they say, my dad just says like, mm-hmm. Yes, preach Tucker. Every once in a while, it gets here with the Holy Spirit while he's watching it. The Holy Ghost visits him and he's just like, oh, no, build a wall. Can I get a wall? He needs a wall. My dad needs a wall. For a guy who lives in Central Pennsylvania, securing the Southern border. It's like an oddly important tone. I don't know what he's worried about. Like he's going to lose his job. You know, like some guy from Honduras is going to walk the whole way to Pennsylvania. Just slam a resume down on my dad's boss's desk. So you're here for the sales position? I'm safe now. Stay quiet on that. Also, I was just at the border of Arizona and Mexico. There's a wall. I had no idea. I got down there. I saw the wall. I was like, holy shit. He built it. They were like, no, it's been here. It's been here for like a century. I was like, no, you got to tell my dad. Fucking him up. He gets fired up every night. It's a crazy way to go to bed every night. So there's apnea mask on. Fucking. Every night. Fucking carodaran. You walk into the living room in my house right now, my dad. You know, I saw the borders of mess right at night. That's crazy. But I make fun of him for it. And then I do the exact same thing just with my phone. I just look at my phone until I can. I'm like, Mr. Potato, what the fuck? That's it. Every day. I just get on read opinions from people I know are dumb. Like in person, I know they're dumb. I've talked to them. And I'm still reading their Twitter, their political opinions. It's great. And my Twitter is crazy. It's half where I'm from, which is the middle of Pennsylvania. So it's white trash. And then half. Now I live in New York. So it's crazy. Like, you know, I still have uncles. They all just got Twitter. They're all fucking fired up. They haven't fun. Do they all have like zero followers? They just tweet into the void. They love it, dude. They do it for the love of the game. Like, Panera was good today. It's onto a server that will outlast civilization. And then now all my new friends are literally communists from Brooklyn. So it's wild, dude. Like I'll get on Twitter. And the first tweet I see will be someone from back home that's just like fucking Colin Kavernic better stand up. Like this tweet, if you support the police, share it if you're not gay. Oh, I'm fucking sharing. I share that. And the next post is just one of my new joke white friends that's just like, I'm not racist. That's it. Every day for the last year, just a different white person popping up. Like, look at me. Look at this article I shared to my Instagram story. I'm not racist, right? All right. You sure? So I don't know if you know this. Like being racist isn't like a yes or no thing. You know what I mean? It's not like you have it or you don't have it. Like being racist is more like being hungry. You know? It's like, yeah, you're not right now. You know? So yeah, you're not hungry right now, but a cheeseburger could cut you off on the highway. And you get hungry. You're hungry all day. The cheeseburger is Jewish in that joke. No, no, no, no, no. Cheeseburgers, whatever type of cheeseburger you thought it was. And your racist heart. Anyway, that's it. I just get online, read opinions from people. The news, like other news is kind of like this is the most divided this country has ever been. It's like with the red states and the blue states. It's like, why? Because we tweet at each other. You know, we had a war, right? You know, this country had a civil war. That was pretty divided. Like at least nowadays we're communicating with each other. Back then, those guys never, they got the news like once a month. Some guy would come by on a horse and they were like, who's talking shit? Like I was like, the south is talking shit. Fuck that. I don't like that. Give me my gun. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to walk down there for a month straight. Shoot the first fucking guy I see down there. That's how much. The civil war was basically just the north just shooting racism out of the south. That's what happened. The north was like south fucking chill. And the south was like, no. So a bunch of guys had to walk down there and shoot him a lot. They were like, all right. We'll let him go. Or not going to be nice to him for a while. Until we find out they're good at football and then roll tide. That way, fucking. It rolled amt. I don't like Albanne with football. I just watched his documentary on Albanne football. It's great. It's about Albanne football. It's about when they desegregated their football team. So up until this point, Albanne football was just white. Everybody down there was pumped on that. They would pack the stadium. Everyone would be like, look at all those whites. Run around, catch it. I'm not knocking them too hard because I still have a little bit of that. In me, you know, like if a white guy catches a ball on Sunday, I'm like, oh shit, go, go, go, go, go. They got him. They got him. The top run is smart run. That's up run there. But now they took it too far. So the documentary focuses on that. The focus is on Bear Bryant, legendary head coach. He was the head coach that brought the first black players onto the team. So the whole documentary is like celebrating Bear Bryant. They're like fucking way to go, Bear. You did it. What a hero. And then you find out it was 1971. Yeah, a little late for high fives on this one, fellas. Holy shit, 71. Like we've been to the moon. There were literally people on the screen. There were literally people on the moon before Alabama had black guys in their secondary. Does anyone understand? There were white corners. White corner backs. You understand how preposterous that is? Some of you are too young to have ever even seen a white corner. They're extinct. They don't exist. There's two left at the San Diego Zoo. They won't reproduce. You'll never see a white corner. But that's what happened. It wasn't like the reason they desegregated the team. That's what the documentary focuses on, which is great. Because it wasn't like, oh, hey, fellas, it's 1971. Maybe we should get with the times. What happened was Alabama's scheduled USC Southern Cal. Alabama's confident. They're like, oh, white ballers. We'll take on anybody. And then USC came down to Alabama with a bunch of black dudes from LA. It just beat the fuck out of Alabama. And then after the game, Bear Bryant gave like a speech and he was like, hey, y'all. Come on. That was it. That's all it took. Everybody down there was like, yeah, we get it. We'll be less racist. It means we can win. What? That's what it is. Like as big as racism is in America football. That's true. Look, there's a Disney movie. Remember the Titans dedicated to what I just told you. The whole point of that, dude, that was one high school football season. Remember the Titans was like, it was eight weeks. Enough. That whole town went from like centuries of like, don't let them in our school to just like, oh shit, the high school teams 4 and 0. Those are my brothers. I'll get off the topic. The point, look, the point I'm trying to make. The point I'm trying to make is if you want to get rights in America, you just got put together a good football team. You know what I mean? If the transgender's got together and put together just a fucking hard nose, run it down your throat, ball cup. If the transgender's just three yards in a cloud of dust, transgender's. If the transgender's community could just somehow upset Alabama. Everybody down there tomorrow would be like, those are some tough bitches, actually. Alright. Alright, we got out of that. There's some rough batches in there, that's alright. This won't go great either. You know how like every show and movie now, it's like a remake of something. They just remake an old thing and just make it like more progressive and just put it out. They remake, they remake Ocean's Eleven like a heist movie with like all gorgeous women. That movie should have been ten minutes long. They literally should have got to the casino and just blown the security guards. Maybe all, here's the keys to safe. Take everything. I love you. You guys, you crazy bitches. I love you bitches. That's it. That's all they make. They either make that or they make like, they make slavery movies every year. Those are for no one. I have black friends. I was like, dude, you guys like these? I was like, no, we thought you got these for you. It's like, no. We all hate those. Stop making them. It's uncomfortable. Civil rights movies are good though. I like like like, like, like, like, Judas in the Black Messiah was sick. Remember the Titans is great. Hidden figures was the movie about the Black ladies at NASA. Or is my dad like, to call it, Medea goes to the moon. And look, that was him that said that. He said that as soon as he said that. I was like, what did you fucking say? You don't talk like that. So every movie is just remade is more progress. I just think it'd be funny if like, the right started remaking. You know what I mean? If they just start like conservatives, like, there's a new Scooby-Doo coming out. And it'd be funny if like, the right remade it. It's just like, Scooby and the gang going around, ripping the wigs off the transgender people. It's like, that's not a woman. Some guy would have got away with it. We solved the case of the Starbucks ghoul. As enough time passed that we can, can we admit that Trump was funny? Can we finally admit that he was funny? Well, hold on. I don't like the tone of that. That's not what I'm going for here. The great leader. He was funny. Now whether or not that's a great quality, the commander-in-chief, that's definitely up for debate. But he was funny. I saw it. And I lived in New York, so the whole time he was in office, I would be like, you know, something would happen. I'd show my friends up there. Look at that. They'd be like, what? All right, but it's funny. Like, there's nothing funny about Donald Trump. I don't know. During Hurricane Dorian, he was like, maybe we should nuke it. Like, that was a real suggestion from the president. The president said that. The president of the United States. He was like, hey, we got a big storm coming. You guys want me to blow it up? I was like, no, what the fuck are you talking about? I don't know. I fuck around, dude. That's what I do. I don't know. Nowadays he's gone. I'll never, like I'll never watch a debate ever again. You imagine like just a regular debate now? After we wouldn't, like we witnessed the go. Undefeated. In debates. And he never said a fact. You know, I'm pressive that is. He was funny and he argued like a fifth grader. He was unstoppable. People would try to hit him with statistics and facts. He would just go, wrong. Like, holy fuck, dude. How was no one prepared for this? Go back and watch those debates. You forget how electric that shit was. Don't tell your friends in Austin. They'll be mad. Just get a six pack. Talks on a Trump highlight video on YouTube. It's a good night, dude. Why I went back. I watched his first debate. That's like my favorite one. At the time, Trump was pulling it like less than 1%. Like he was no one liked him. If you guys like him now, you didn't back then. And I know that because my dad, I watched my dad. My dad at the time, he would like any time Trump even came on TV. My dad would go, good day. Good day to you guys. He was like, you have to wait for the time. You would like any time Trump even came on TV. You might have, like, good just fucking Joker. Get him off the fucking screen. And then now my dad's like, you're all fucking guys can't go to the Capitol. He's like, you guys can't have fun anymore. And it was coming to the debates. That's how we got Trump. These debates. And the first one was the best one. So he said Republican Prime Minister, everyone's up on stage. still doing their political shit. So like the first couple guys that talk are like, I'm from Kentucky and I love the education. And the crowd's like, nice. We didn't know what was coming. And the next guy's like, I'm from Georgia and I love religion. The crowd's like, pretty good. This is a good one. This is a heated debate. And then I finally got to Trump's turn to talk. And he was just like, Rand Paul is ugly and the whole crowd was like, oh! You know you could do that in this. You can just do that as your thing. And Rand Paul's like, all right, everybody settle down. We're trying to have a debate here. And the whole crowd was like, shut the fuck up, Rand Paul. Ugly bitch. And we just kept throwing dorks up on stage to make them debate Trump. It was not fair. It was mean for us to have done that to people. These guys were in politics their whole lives. They just had to debate a fucking maniac up there. Who didn't give a fuck to. And I hate it. It was fun to cheer for him in the debates. It was fun to cheer for him in the debates. Because he was going up against guys that had been in politics for like 40 years. And then he showed up to the event, like, oh fuck it, what are we talking about? He had no clue. Every week he had no fucking idea. There's one debate. There's one debate. In the middle of it going back and forth about the economy with Ted Cruz. They're literally talking about the economy. And in the middle of it he's just like, Ted's wife, ugly as a dog. Like this. Holy shit, dude. And Ted was like, I'm from Texas. You don't talk about a man's family like that. You've got a dog wife, Ted. I was like, everyone knows. So. Yeah, and a week later, Ted Cruz was on TV, like, I support Donald Kennedy. It was like, you pussy. I will say this. The one thing that sucked about Trump losing was for me was because I just figured out kind of how to do his voice. That's kind of a bummer that I just, it's not hard to do Trump. It's very, all you have to do that is do that. Do that a second off from where it should be in the sentence. And then all you, like, you don't have to sound like him. All you have to do is get his cadence down. It's very easy. All you have to do is describe something and then say you described it that way. That's it. It's every time. What a big room this is. I walked in here. I said, wow, what a big room. That's it. Every time. Austin. A lot of homeless. I walked in here. I said, wow, that's a lot of homeless. You guys got it. You got it homeless. You got to, what are you guys doing about it? Whatever you guys are doing is not working. So just switch. I don't know what to do either. But do something. A lot of tents. Why? It's been making me laugh thinking about Trump, like, not understanding why people are homeless. I walked out of my stomach. I said, why? Living in tents, I could never these guys. But I will say this about trial. I don't want you guys to get, I don't want to turn this into a rally. I don't want you to. I will say this. I don't freak out. Just listen. I think it's fair to say that of all the presidents we've had, I think it's fair to say that Trump would have been the funniest one to see get shot. You know? Dude, the Patriots got fired up on that, dude. Let's have him fun at this show. No, look, I didn't even say it would be funny. I said, funny-est. It's a huge difference. Technically, there's a funniest of everything. There it is. It doesn't make it funny, but there is, like, think of the worst thing you can think of. There's a funniest one. I'll go first. I'll think of one. It's closer to you. None of those are funny. Zero funny. But maybe there was one where the horse girl in the class could sense something was coming. You know what I mean? They were like, what's wrong? And she was like, pfft. I was like, pfft. You know? But back to what I was saying about it. If you had what I said was true. If you had to rank them from least funny to funniest assassination, easy number one. Really? He'd be talking shit like when it happened. He'd be doing another rally. My opponent's gay. I walked in. I saw him. I said, well, this guy's gay. The shooter would be coming out of you. Sit down. You were gay. You were gay. You get hit. He'd definitely make a funny noise into them. Like, you'd get hit back. Pfft. It fell. You fall funny. I will say, I did write that joke before Biden could be added to the rankings. I don't think he would be the funniest, but the only reason Biden might be the funniest is because I think Biden's the first president you could punch assassinate. You know what I mean? Just walk right through the metal text, and say, Mr. President, oh, what are you doing? Do you mind? It's a body shot. I dad that joke. My dad's. He gave me a talk about killing presidents. I'm like, what about Biden? He's like, yeah. My dad's, he's a good. Good guy. He's an alcoholic. But he's good. He's like a good. He's a good alcoholic. He's not hurting anybody. But everyone's always has an excuse while he's drinking. That's what's funny about it. Like, he can never just get hammered at me. Like, yeah, I got fucked up. Like, it's always, like, you'll see him on like a Monday. You'll be like, damn, it's Monday. You're getting fucked up. He's like, it's fucking Monday night football. I have a couple drinks. Jeez. You'll see him on like a Tuesday. You'll be like, damn, it's Tuesday. You're getting fucked up. He's like, it's fucking. There's no football. What the hell? And then my sister does heroin. And that one where like, you do need to, you know, you need to stop doing that. Which sucks for her, because if she played guitar, everybody would be like, uh, yeah. I'm gonna step she's a hairdresser here, so. That's not as cool. Relax. It's my family. It's my family. Don't worry about it. Actually, based on this crowd, I'm sure it's actually a lot of you guys. Families. And that's all right. We're allowed to talk about it. My sister, so she was doing heroin. We had to have an intervention for her. She lived down in Pittsburgh. We live in the middle of Pennsylvania, so we had to trick her to come home. You got to trick them. I don't know if you know these guys. They're not just fucking stopping by. They're very busy. They're the busiest people. They get a bad rap for being lazy. Does it take a lot of naps? But if they're awake, they're fucking, you're very busy. They're scaring around. They're doing quests. That's what they do. If you do heroin long enough, you run out of money. You got to start doing quests. You know, it's like a fucked up game of Zelda every day. You just wake up to a new quest. It's like, you need to gather coppers. You're going to find a scrap yard. It sounds nice. I wish I got quests. But eventually the quests get pretty dark. Scrappy yard. That's like level one. Towards the end, the quests, you need to get titty fucked behind the home depot. That's what it's time for a change. So we had to come up with a plan to trick her to come home for the intervention. The plan we came up with was we told her that we had won tickets to go to six flags. And it worked. She called back. She's like, all right, I'll be there. She got on the first bus. It's like a seven hour bus ride. There's nothing to them, dude. If you take heroin, every bus is a bullet train. There's a five minute ride, tops. Anyway, so the plan was pick my sister up from the bus stop, not take her to six flags. Take her to a hotel where we're going to have an intervention. I didn't want to start the intervention with like a lack of trust. So I took her to six flags. The day of her intervention, that day she and I went to six flags together. And I thought that was a nice gesture, but it turns out intervention is supposed to be rock bottom. You know what I mean? Like intervention is supposed to be the worst day of your life. Not like you're tired from easily the best day. Humanly, I mean, she took heroin and rode roller coasters. It was, dude, it was impossible. We sat it out and we thought, you better fucking change your life. She's like, I don't want to go back tomorrow. We're like, no. And I was with her. She was fucked up. If you know anyone from Pittsburgh, you know what she was wearing. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants. Steelers pajama pants. She dusted off her finest tines award for the occasion. So we get in there. There's a water park there. We didn't know. They added that. We haven't been there since we were kids. We get in there. There's one of those water slides. It's just like a fucking straight drop. Like no sides on it, no raft. Just by yourself. She looks at it. She's like, I want to go up on that one. I was like, yeah, yeah, fuck it. You know? I knew she was going to rehab like that night. So I was like, yeah, good, this one in. You're about to have a rough couple months here. That's just gonna be. Also, I figured they would stop her. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants. Trying to get on a water slide. All they did was make her take her fucking crocs off. There's your yellow scrubs. So she's climbing up this ladder. She gets to the top of this fucking giant water slide. And you know how like when it's your turn next on a water ride, you gotta like lay there in that water and like wait to go. She, she knotted off. She took a nap up at the top like a Dracula. Laying in front of some high school lifeguard that's like, man, it's your turn. They just center down there to sleep. Just, just flying down this thing, dude. She hit, there's a ramp at the end. She hit her, we all got to watch her wake up in air. And she did the whole fucking... You know, I don't know how that wasn't fucking rock bottom. It's like you woke up in air. Anyway, don't be sad about it. She's good, she did go to rehab. And that's good, yeah, she's done. She stopped using it, she's sober, she's all good. Two years clean, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's good. She did get cancer though. And COVID. Cancer and COVID. Bam, bam, bam. Why? So, yeah, I'll tell you what, this was cool. I got, I was with her, I lit, she was at home, she went back to my parents, because when you have cancer and COVID, you gotta go home. You have to go home, you can't keep hanging out. But no, I was with her, it was crazy. She, this year she beat heroin cancer and COVID. It was like living with fucking Rocky. It was crazy dude, every week my whole family was like, give up, you're never gonna win this. She's like, he's kept winning. When she got COVID, I was like, all right, you're definitely dead. She's like, oh, COVID. So, I ain't here no bell. This fucking is wailed on it, dude. Yeah, she's got a hell of a chin. Hell of a chin on my sister. And that's what, what better quality could you ask for in a human? Anyway. Damn, dudes. Fuck that music across the street, dude, that fucking bothers me. I'm an old man now, turn it down. Turn it down, what is that, rap? Turn it off. I gotta talk about my sister, ruin heroin over here. This has been making me laugh. I've been thinking about like the first time, like Jesus Christ. I do comedy a lot. And every once in a while you can hear music from another room and it's like, damn, dude, music's so much better than God. Every time I hear music, I'm like, fuck, dude, that shit crushes what I do. Some fucking idiot dressed like Cam Newton, press and play. It's so much better than this. Like, you guys want to hear about my problems? This guy's like, take Molly, finger someone, press play, you guys do you. Fuck, there haven't so much fun over there. Get out of here, you motherfucker, go dance. I knew you wanted to dance. Like I wanted to dance all night. Alright, I like my family. It's a good family. I had to go to my niece's seventh and eighth grade girls volleyball match recently. No, kidding, I'm kidding, dude, shut up. Just relax. I don't want to fuck kids. But if you ever want to get out of something, that's all you have to do. Like, if you're a friend, like, do you want to come to our son's T-Ball game? Be like, what grade are the kids in? And then no matter what they say, go, oh, fourth. No, I went to this fucking kids volleyball match. Can we knock it off with volleyball shorts on little kids? It's weird. It's gross, dude, just get them gym shorts. That's all. No, dude, it's gross. Because then, you know, it's just me and the other uncles up in the bleachers kind of make an eye contact with each other. Bro, are you seeing this? Such a funny way to just destroy a show. Just right at the very end, be like, aren't kids hot? You know, give it up for Trump. Aren't kids hot? No, I am truly I'm serious about the gym shorts though. It's weird. And so I got home from this fucking volleyball match. My roommate, his girlfriend played college volleyball. So I'm very excited to like, shit on volleyball whenever I can't. So I get in there and I was like, you know, volleyball is fucking, that's a weird culture. Get them fucking shorts. Get them gym shorts. The shorts they're wearing is gross. And she was like, no. We need those shorts for speed on the court. And I was like, I know that's not true. I watched the NBA. None of you are moving as fast as like a ref. And those guys are wearing like slacks dress shoes for some reason. She was like, no, we need those shorts. The tight shorts they're essential. She compared them to like a helmet in football. I was like, I know they're not essential because I googled the special Olympics volleyball team. All of a sudden those shorts weren't so essential for them. What's that about? How baggy do you think they're? They looked like the fucking N1 mix they're about there. Offensively baggy is how I would describe all of their attires. No. Bro, adults, we all agree the special Olympics is a good program. I just, it's great. I just feel like the guy who came up with it had to be like a real risk taker. You know what I mean? That's a wild thing to suggest for the first time. There's some guy in a board meeting like, I got an idea. We should be racing these motherfuckers. It's like, what did you say? He's like, fucking town overs said they had the fastest ones. So we settle it, you know. I'm not making fun of the Olympians. The concept is wild. It's a wild, like if you're a best friend in Venice, the special Olympics, and told you about it first, you'd be like, don't ever tell anybody that. Who the fuck are you going to tell that to? What are you doing? Polval? I actually personally, I actually volunteered and coached with the special Olympics for a little while. So, you know, what did you guys do? No, don't clap. Please. I did it for those kids. No, I'm kidding. No. I looked like this. So, me coaching the special Olympics, I was like a fucking double agent. No one knew who side I was on to. Player of chaperones, no one knew. I'd be standing there coaching, holding a clipboard with five dudes that looked exactly like me. You know, see the coaches from the other team looking over like, I think they got, I think they're fucking letting one of them coach the other. Yeah. No, I did coach the special Olympics for a little while, and it's fun. That's another thing you're allowed to talk about. It's happy. Everyone there is sportsmanship. It is funny. Don't let anyone tell you it's not funny, dude. I was there. Everyone there is laughing. It's fun. I coach basketball. Kids would catch the ball and just fucking, just fucking, launch it into the bleachers. They'd be like, what the fuck are you doing out there? I don't know. I was like, I don't know. I was fucking. My whole team ruled. Everybody, every dude on my team was, they were the funniest. They fucking, they were bros. They were bros, dude. My whole team loved two things. They loved tits. They do. I don't know if you know these guys, dude. They fucking loved the ladies. They loved the ladies. And they loved John Cena. That's it. That was the news. Every day. We'd be in the huddle. They'd be like, there's a lot of ladies here tonight. I was like, ooh, yeah. They'd be like, what do you think John Cena's up to? Oh, you're gonna have to get way worse before you meet him. See, John Cena's like the angel of death for those guys. I told my guys. I was like, you see Cena coming. You get the fuck out of there. He's taking souls with him. Every year, hooters would sponsor our one basketball tournament. So every year, hooters would bring like three or four waitresses and they would present like a big cardboard check donation to the Special Olympics. As soon as the girls entered the gym, the game changed. Entirely, dude. It went from like hugs and sportsmanship to just, I dudes got competitive. Like very competitive. Fucking ripping down rebounds. It's hitting my ups. And then at the end of the game, there'd be a hug line. Between the waitresses and the players. And yeah, that went about exactly how you would imagine that one. We had to break out the fucking jaws of life, too. My boys are ragged all those young sluts. And I'm not knocking the players. They were totally in the right. The girls were hot. The waitresses, like every year, I would sneak into the hug line myself. Alright, I think I'm gonna get out of here, guys. Thank you guys very much. She's a lot of fun. Thank you. You
For those of you who do not know me, I grew up in a very religious household, with a very religious black mother that associated God with everything. Her favorite saying, God don't like ugly, all day every day. God don't like ugly, God don't like ugly. So I grew up thinking damn, we'll be gober going to hell. My Tyson, hell. JJ going to hell with gasoline drones on his... Woo! But just imagine if that's true, right? If that's true, God really don't like ugly. I guess that means Bismarcky is the anti-crime, right? I mean... Now come on, y'all know Bismarcky, I'm saying that's not like a bulletin tonight. You know what I'm saying? Homies so ugly he can make the onion cry, that ain't right? This is something that has to be talked about. Oh man, I like to talk about stuff that I see around my way all the time, like the drug bills, the young drug bills, y'all seeing. These are the ****, but there's people on the earth, I'm saying, not days because they sell in that poison. They're s**t in the way they dress. I'm saying they all do the same thing, go out and buy those telemate leather jackets, and they put their name on the back. Rahim clocking doodoo dumb dollars. Then they go on the corner and sell their drugs. The cops roll up. Excuse me, Rahim. Now one of y'all's s**t in me out. Where's this bump? No, no, he just said right hand. You heard it right? He said right hand on my neck. I ain't on my neck. ****, make noob. Before I go, ladies and gentlemen, it wouldn't be fun if I didn't bring out Shantay.

This is going to be a fun show. Mark has been back there practicing his skits all day. I walked past the dressing room. Mark was staring into the mirror like Natalie Bourbon and Black Swan for an hour. Please welcome Mark, Ellen. Thank you, Los Angeles. How's everybody doing? Oh, it is so good to be here. We have a lot to get through. I have to start with this. I know a lot of you came out here for a great standup show, but some of you came here just to make sure I was in fact still alive. This is sort of my fault and I need to apologize for it because I was excited about the show as we're taping it at Saturday night. This past Wednesday I got a flyer and I was like, oh, I know I'll post this flyer on social media so people know about the show. I posted the picture and it's a good picture of me, I thought. It's me on stage, microphone, smiling, whimsical look in my eye. You can tell this boy's dream is coming true. The problem was it was a black and white photo. Already some fans of mine started to get nervous. They're like, oh, no, what happened to the boy with the dream? It's a black and white photo. Nobody ever does that. And then the mistake was compounded because there was like a bluish hue over my head. I looked like a force ghost in retrospect. And then it said, Mark L is live special taping, but it wasn't the letters like, wow, special taping. It was way at the bottom. Why is special taping? And the kind of fun it was can only be described as church pamphlet cursive. So I posted it thinking, all right, let's see how it goes. An hour later I check Instagram, over a thousand likes. And I'm like, somebody's selling out some shows this weekend. And then I saw the comments. Top comment over a hundred likes on it. What the fuck, dude, are you dead? All lowercase, no punctuation. And it's very out of character for my mom to use that kind of language. So I'm here to entertain you, but also to let everybody know that I'm alive. I am well. I am in my adopted home of Southern California. We have a packed house here. And I'm so glad y'all showed up. I really am because I need a theater full of people to get out of the house. It's a rough pandemic for me, man, because I'm an optimist. And I think a lot of optimists had a really tough time the last couple years. If you're in this room and you see the glasses half full, if you see the COVID test is half negative, pandemic started all of us optimists were like, we got this. Humanity can do this. Let's get this over with. We walked in there. We're like, we can all wear masks for two weeks, okay? We'll mask up 14 days, day 15. We'll go outside, rip our masks off in unison, breathe the fresh air, throw it in the air, like it's a high school graduation ceremony. Except we didn't graduate, did we? No. America, we were the kid that got held back. And it was a tough one for me personally, because when the pandemic started, I was in my 30s. I marched into that thing. A confident, healthy, energetic 30 something, cuts me coming out, a tired, grizzled, broken 40 something. What's a TikTok? Who names a stallion Meg? Where are my Wednesday pills? I was like a wolf that had been hunting in the wild. And then it got domesticated for a couple years. And now I'm on the tundra and I can't hunt anymore. I'm just out there running with a pack, guys, postmates isn't going to be here for another eight hours. We all went a little minimalist, right? We all got a little isolated the last couple years. Everybody got a new hobby. Everybody got a new hobby. We got some bread people here. You know who got crazy is the air fryer folk. Yeah. Some of you fuckers with air frires. You all started out conservative, right? You got the air fryer. The first week you plug it in, all right, don't make any sudden movements. And what was your first meal with the air fryer? Let's just do one bagel bite. Get down, get down. And then week two, everybody thought they were Guy Fieri. We got a whole cow. We're going to see if we can fit it into this one air fryer. I got a new hobby too. I started doing drugs. Thank you. I saw my last special dog step brother. You know, I don't do the drugs. And that's in the past. And I don't know what they were talking about in high school. Not only am I having fun, I think I'm hooked. It's a good time. I like the edibles. I like the weed. It helps me sleep. It helps me relax. Takes the edge off the blow. And part of the fun for me too is that I'm old enough to remember when it was illegal. So now when I go to a dispensary, I still feel like I'm doing something a little naughty. You know, I tiptoe in. And anything that cops are here, there's a security guard at every dispensary. I go to this place in the valley called ice cream. But the cream is spelled with a K. So you know, that ain't ice cream in my bag. And I acknowledge I started way too late. I'm way too late in the game. Like drugs, it's like skiing or golf. If you want to get good, you got to start when you're a little kid. Right? Because nobody has good drug stories in my age. That happens when you're young, right? Like, how old were you? You're your first drug? 16? Okay. It was the weed or you just slammed the age right in your toes. What was the... You can tell I'm new because I still call it the weed. Like, I go to an ice cream. You sell doobies here? Is that a thing? Yeah, I... I'm jealous of that. Because like, you're 16, you get high. You probably had fun. Man, we got cut class and we woke up in a dumpster. Like, it's a funny story. What's a good drug store in your 40s? Matt, I got so high last night, I lost my family. LAUGHTER Yeah, me and the boys. We got baked over the weekend. And now we live at Extended Stay America. So I don't know how... And I'll still make rookie mistakes with it, too. I like to... Usually my routine is I'll do my shows at night and then I'll do an edible when I get home, watch my stories and go to bed. Right? A couple weeks ago I didn't have any shows. It was a Tuesday night. It was like 6'30 and I'm like, I think it's enough. I think I've waited long enough to get the edible in here. So I crank it into my golet and I start feeling it. And then I realize, oh no, Mark didn't eat dinner yet. That's mistake number one. Then I made another one by deciding it was a good time to go to the grocery store. See? Oh, you professionals are like, dude, you cannot be doing this to me right now. It gets worse. So when I'm sober, I shop at Whole Foods. Where are my Whole Foods people at? There you go. Clap if you think you're better than everybody. That's... That's been me for the better part of the last decade. I go to Whole Foods, but on this particular night, I got high and I was like, I think it's time to go back to Ralph's. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yep. Yep, Ralph's for my East Coast friends. It's like the food line or the Wegmans up in the Pacific Northwest. It's like the QFC. It's the normal grocery store, but I've been going to Whole Foods forever. So then I got high and I went back to Ralph's and it was like I was skipping into Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Oh, it was beautiful. Everything that I remember was there. The snacks, the desserts, the odorant that actually works. It's an amazing place. As soon as I walked into this land of miracles, I grabbed a balloon. It wasn't my birthday. I just wanted the balloon. And then I hit aisle six. And aisle six for you, Ralph's regulars, you know. That's a cereal aisle. And to me that night, that was the Asgardian Bridge to Valhalla. I remember all the cereals, Tony the Tiger waving me back. We missed you, bud. Because Whole Foods, they don't have a cereal aisle. If you're lucky, they have a lady handing granola on the way out. They have one sad shelf with a couple different cereals. The best stuff at Whole Foods is this stuff called Heritage Crunch. Sounds like it's from the Revolutionary War. Heritage Crunch? Heritage is another word for old. I'm not starting a new day with old crunch. I don't want to eat Heritage Crunch. I'd like to speak to the captain of crunch. If I may, Heritage Crunch sounds like Captain Crunch's racist grandfather. After you, boys, are done playing pirates. I got this flag. I want to show you in my study. Come here. And all of us, marijuana users, got some good news recently. President Biden, he repealed anybody who ever had a simple possession that's gone. You're pardoned. You're good to go. This is good news. It's good news. I don't necessarily want Biden himself doing the drugs. I love that every time there's an election cycle, every time we're looking at who the new president could be. The media always loves asking that question. Have you ever gotten high? You're smoked weed. I remember the first time I saw it was when I was a kid, and they asked Clinton. And Clinton was like, I don't know, maybe. Once you come back to my room, find out. And then they asked George W. Bush the question, and he did not understand it. And Obama was the first one. Obama was the first one who just flat out, admitted, and he shocked everybody. So have you ever smoked pot? And he was like, ah, yeah. Really fun. So Obama admitted he smoked weed. Trump claimed he never did. And I don't know if you all know, does slight difference in temperament. Now, I'm not saying Trump doesn't do drugs, but if he does, weed is not the one he's been enjoying. And you can tell, as the presidency started unravel, right? There's supposed to be like a peaceful transition of power. There's supposed to be a nice sit down between the sitting president and the incoming president. And it works like a relay race, right? Like, the president has a baton. They hand it to the next one. So here comes Donnie around the corner, and he's about to hand the baton to Joan. He's like, fuck you. Don't get it. One of the last things Trump did when he was in office is he took Air Force One out. You know where they were going? No where. They didn't have a destination. He just wanted to be in the big plane one more time. So my theory is, they got in the plane, they did a few laps around DC, they did a mountain of coke. Probably came up with a great idea for a fusion restaurant. And then the plane lands. And the last thing Trump did before he de-planned Air Force One for the very last time, I think Trump took an upper decker in the bathroom. Now some of you in this crowd maybe too classy to know what an upper decker is. Luckily for you, I went to college in North Carolina. So an upper decker is where you poop, not in the toilet, but you take the lid off the back, you poop in there, put the toilet lid back on, nobody knows where the smell is coming from. And I don't think the Biden administration has found it yet. And that's why Biden trips. Every time he goes up the stairs to Air Force One. I feel so bad for that poor bastard when he trips on the stairs, but I'm also kind of impressed at the athleticism because he falls up. I don't know which pill in the matrix he took, but he just keeps going. He's like a reverse slinky. It's an actually incredible thing. And we doesn't even really the cool drug for the kids, for the Gen Zs, the millennials, y'all like your shrooms now. Get shroom people. They have their fun little terms, like micro dosing. Like, oh no, I'm micro dosing. Like it's not like you're doing drugs still. Micro dosing. Like I'm not in alcoholic. It's a core Anita. Just a tiny little one. Shrooms is what happens when you give disposable income to a generation raised on Mario card. It's all these shrooms were good for your whole life. And I mean, my era is before that. Like my Mario didn't have a vehicle. If you're lucky, you had a dinosaur give you a lift in like one level. But I go all the way back to the original Super Mario Brothers, which was the best because it was so easy. They would just aim you in one direction. And this is your whole video game right here. If you ran so far this way, you can't even go back that way. Get your fat ass to the castle. The premise of Super Mario Brothers, a king's daughter gets kidnapped by a giant dragon. And he sends two Italian plumbers to go rescue him. The king got all his hands together and he's like, all right, we need to get my little girl back. I do not want to spend a lot of money. Ideas. And they're like, well, Navy SEALs, that's expensive. Marines are pretty costly. One guy raised his hand, hey, remember those two guys that fixed the toilet last week? Yeah, the one found the upper decker. We had no idea what that smell was. I'm a big sports fan. I love the NFL. I played college football on Xbox and had to retire concussions, you know how it goes. But even the sports games are good to play like Madden is so complex now. Madden, you can actually make yourself into an NFL player. You can make me into an NFL athlete, which is actually easier than going to the gym. Because like, I could be sort of Mara or I could win the Super Bowl right now. And it's weird being a sports fan my age, 42 years old. And you realize that now every ad is targeted right at you. Every time I watch a game, every time I listen to sports talk radio, every ad starts the same way. Are you past your pride? You're not at the energy you used to. I think it's me they're talking to. Are you a little bitch, Mark? Who sang that? Trying to hop us up on energy boys. Now I'm nervous every time I go work out every time I go to the driving range. I'm worried Doug Floody and Frank Thomas are going to jump out of the bushes, throw some pills at me. Don't take the bait, man. I'm too old to have energy. Energy's going to get me arrested. I'm going to go out after the show. You're going to see a bunch of you guys in their 20s and they have way too much energy. They're like, oh, it's Saturday. I got to fuck something or fight something. I don't know what it's going to be. And I was like that. When I was in my 20s, I wanted to date every woman I saw, right? Same thing in my 30s. In my 40s, I want to sleep. That's it. An energy? That's going to fuck up my nap. I love naps, man. I took the 5p end of that. I refer to naps like it's a train schedule. I took the 5pm backstage and that's my favorite one because the 5pm is where you go to bed and it's light out and then you wake up and it's dark and you're like, what the fuck happened? Where am I? Like, I thought about this. I love sleep so much. I no longer fear death. It's just a good snooze. So when you're at my funeral, we'll use the picture I posted. But don't, if you get to eulogize me, don't do the normal stuff. I'll say Mark died doing what he loved. No. Say Mark's dead and now he's doing what he loved. I try to make it to the gym when I can. I have a personal trainer because I work in entertainment and that's the law. Seriously, all you dreamers out there, moving to LA, here's how it works. You drive out to California, they stop you at the border, you surrender all your fruits and vegetables and they hand you a personal trainer. Sir, you got to give us those avocados and this is cricket, your trainer. Enjoy it. They're just so optimistic and positive all the time. I go to the gym and they're like, all right, Mark, today's leg day. I'm like, uh, leg day, how do you think I got in here? We're good on the legs. I have a demo of the movements for you which is a little intimidating because they show you how to do it properly and then I have to follow that. And they're like, Mark, here's how you do a deadlift and I'm like, think, and that's how a 28 year old does a deadlift. I'm 42. My deadlift is called two of my friends. Hey, you assholes want free pizza? Help me move this couch. Get over here. It's still going better than it was. When I first got out here, I didn't know what to do. I joined a gym called 24 hour fitness and it sounds like a good premise, right? I was open all day, all night. Problem was back then, I was chubby, I was robust, I was portally, I'm trying to think of other phrases that aren't the F word. We're not supposed to say the thing I called Mario and Luigi, I'm not supposed to say that. I feel like I can say the word fat. Most of my best friends are fat. So that was an accurate description of me at the time when I was out here. And if you're in my situation, 24 hour fitness is tough. There's never a good hour to go. You can either go in the middle of the night when it's just you and some nutcase wearing a spider-man costume right next to you. Put down the camera, Peter, I get it. Or you can go in the middle of the day, which is the worst time to go if you're overweight because it's always the good looking athletic, the winners in life on the treadmills. And then there's just a line of chubby people like we would have been in at TGI Fridays by now. What's the... I'm sorry, but I think if you're the biggest one at the gym, you can go up to anybody. Ah, yeah, excuse me. You're training for a triathlon? That's cute. Last night I got drunk and ate a birthday cake by myself. You're 5% body fat, I'm 5% dominoes. Off you go. Yeah, that's the phrase, man. Past your prime. And I'm not ready to admit that I'm past my prime yet. I will say this is as good as it's going to get. So, and you ladies thinking about it tonight's the night. And every time I like, I'm talking to a girl who's younger than me, I feel like a desperate stockbroker. Like, trying to talk her into a stock that I know is shit. Because guys, when you're in your 20s and investment terms, you're like gold, you're silver, you're precious metals, you're going to last forever. Once you hit 40, you're cryptocurrency. You know, like, I look good tonight, it could all be gone tomorrow. And you have to make do with what you have. We have pills for some stuff, we have surgeries for other things, but nothing's going to make these hands any bigger. I don't care who you voted for, these are trump hands. We can all admit that, right? So just tiny little, grabbing any pussy power, documents before you leave office. And if you look at it throughout the history of time, every dictator had tiny little hands. That's why they had to be a dictator. Every cold leader, tiny hands, every one of them, Jonestown, Nexium, Peloton, they all have tiny little hands. Just begging you to stay with them on this journey. Keep peddling the bike, Mark. Hands are going to stay this size, feet aren't going to grow anymore. I'll be honest, once you hit a certain age, this doesn't work. It doesn't work as well. I'm not ashamed to admit it. My reproductive area, it's about as effective as the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I know, it's probably going to be okay. I got a 66% completion percentage. Let's go in the bedroom. That was the thing that bothered me. I was all four of vaccine. I wanted a vaccine, but the way we rolled it out, this kind of thought was dumb because people think that Americans want free. We don't want anything free. We say we do. I want free healthcare. Then you got free healthcare. I don't trust this shit anymore. We want exclusive. Okay, we don't want free. We want exclusive. Think about it. You came to the show tonight. If everybody got a free t-shirt, you'd be like, look at this cheap piece of shit. But I could take this whole crowd to a basketball game and the mascot comes out with the t-shirt cannon, you're losing your goddamn minds. Give me the shirt. Give me the shirt. Next time there's a pandemic, I want a vaccine. Don't get me wrong. I want there to be a vaccine, but just don't announce it because we can't handle it. It's going to get politicized. It's going to get divisive. Make the vaccine and just put it in McNuggets. Yeah. You've accidentally McNuggets. The whole pandemic is going to be over in three weeks. And then when it's time for our booster shot, the McRib is back for a limited time only. I thought you retired. Well, Monkey Pog's brought it out of retirement, baby. You know, anti-vaxxers would find out though. They find out we're spiking the McNuggets with medicine. Maybe protests and outside Mickey D's. You didn't tell us what you're putting in the McNuggets. And McDonald's is like, we've never told you what we're putting in our time. You think the clown tells us what he's doing up there? We don't know. Go to McDonald's after the show. Ask him what's in a quarter pounder. They're like, oh, there's some brown. It's a little thing orange, I think. They always have their excuses. You know, their conspiracy theories. Some people thought they're good microchips. When they got the vaccine, they thought they were good microchip that wall greens. That's where we're keeping them, really. That's where the government's storing the microchips. At wall greens, right next to the self-checkout that doesn't work for more than 10 consecutive minutes. Let me tell you something. You got microchip that wall greens. Nobody knows where the fuck you are right now. You're safe. They always have the same reasoning. Like, I don't want the garments to know what I'm doing or where I'm going. Three hours later, we tell them. We're all the flow out wings. Get in here, self-checkout. I was thinking about this a lot. I don't think it'd be the worst thing if we microchipped you, man. I don't think it'd be the worst thing. Just go with me on this. Because currently on Earth, we have one species that we regularly microchip. And dogs look pretty happy. I have a dog. She was better than anybody in this room. She gets to sleep all the time. She gets to eat more. She gets to whole food shit. She gets to go outside. She gets to take a shit outside. The smile on this young boy's face when I said that. You're like, really? I could do that? Get microchips on. Yes, you too. Don't you just want to try that freedom once? Just go right out there and we'll show you a bowl of our. Just drop-trow and nobody gets mad at you. Like, oh, this is great. They don't get mad at you. They get mad at you for not picking it up. How great would that be? Oh, he's so cute. Bring a bag, asshole. I did that joke in New York and just pulling it out in the back. What about cats? I'm like, yeah, I know. We microchip cats, I guess, and cats are. I don't consider them pets. They're more like in-laws. You know, they kind of show up and they just don't really leave. And there's technically love there, but they're just really judging you. You feed them once. They just stay. I don't know. I did have, like, I was suspicious of the vaccine recently because I don't know if anybody else is going through this. I can't remember shit. Like, my memory is awful. And it's the kind of memory loss where, if you're looking for your keys, then you're like, oh, I was holding my keys the whole time. They're like, I keep finding my sunglasses that are on my head. Or how long have I been driving this car for? I mean, this is not good. And every time that happens to me, my knee-truck reaction is, that's the vaccine. Never once did I consider it might be due to the fact that I now do drugs every night of my life. That never came up in the thought process. You know, couple edibles, some beers every night. I don't know why my brains foggy. It's got to be that one shot of medicine I got eight months ago. But I did discover hidden benefits of marijuana. A hidden power to marijuana is that now documentaries last forever. Because I'll put on a documentary high. I'll watch 20 minutes fall asleep. The next night, I go to pick it up, and I'm like, I don't remember the last 15 minutes of what I watched last night. I think it's time to go back to one part documentaries. They're getting a little too beefy. Not every story needs 10 parts. I watch the 13 part documentary on whether a woman fell down the stairs or not. That's the whole documentary. She wasn't a famous athlete or an international conflict. We were just figuring out if she comes here, did she marry the wrong guy? I don't know. And I was riveted. I was like, did she fall? Was she pushed? Why do I care about this person? When I was a kid, I watched a documentary on the formation of the universe. One hour. With commercials. Now, there is some subject matter that dictates you need a longer time to tell the story. My favorite documentary of all time, Ken Burns is the Civil War. A wrestler called in 10 years, Civil War 1. I hope we can all laugh about that in a decade, but I don't know. I'm fascinated by the Civil War. I grew up on a lot of those battlefields, and it goes through everything. The Civil War documentary is comprehensive. You get the Battle of Fort Sumter, the Surrendered Appomattox, Captain America, and Iron Man duking it out. But the most fascinating part of it to me is the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. So as the story goes, Abraham and Mary Todd, they saw play that night at Ford's Theatre after a long day of vampire hunting. Can anybody name what play they were at? I have the best goddamn fans in the world. They're like, all right, we can't just yell at that. We'll raise our hand and hope he calls on us. All right, you. A guy that really wants to take a shit outside. What do you... What's... Are American Cousin? We were looking for Jersey boys. He was actually saying, Jersey boys. Oh, you're right. It was are American Cousin, and you can still go see Ford's Theatre. I grew up in DC. You can still go to Ford's Theatre, see the balcony. You can see next door where John Wilkes puts his nut in. It's a hard rock cafe. Right. So John Wilkes put out a big bowl of heritage crunch, and then he starts... Needle in into the hard rock cafe. It's a genius plot because nobody's going to hear a gunshot when we're rocking out to Death Leopard. So Booth jumps in, he caps Lincoln, and he was a known actor at the time, and you thought fuckers could get canceled today. He shot the president, and then being the, you know, the Thessapian he is, he made a show. He jumped on stage, broke his leg in the process, but landed, and he said to the crowd, six-sempor tyranists. Which is Latin for us to all tyrants, but I'm feeling not a lot of people in here knew that. And it's nothing against y'all, I don't know it either. But man, crowds were educated in the 1860s. This guy just shot the president of the United States, he jumps on stage, says Chittin' Latin, and they're all like, wow, okay, I get it. The other actors run stage like, do I yes and this? I don't know. I mean, put that in context today. If somebody broke in here and they shot me in the back of the head and said six-sempor tyranists, the cops would be interviewing y'all after the show. Did he say anything? I think he said something about Antifa. I really don't. You're a good crowd. I'm not talking about abortion. I don't want to do it either, but I'm a white man. It's my job to tell you ladies how to feel about your bodies. I don't have a uterus. Here's what to do with yours. Those who can't do teach. You know what? I'll back up. So, a little while ago, my Twitter account got hacked. My Twitter account got hacked. Everybody in this crowd knows Twitter. If you're watching this a few months later, Twitter was an app on your phone. Where you could get some information and you could realize that the thing you've loved your whole life is actually stupid. So my Twitter account got hacked and I verified, had the blue check mark before the bird had a yard sale. I had the verified. So it's my blue check mark. It's my name. It's my picture. But I couldn't get in there. It was a scam. And the scam posted from my account, which people trust. Hey, guys, I know times are tough right now, but I'm selling PlayStation 5s for 50 bucks. And I'm donating all the proceeds to charity. And this happened to be the day when Roby Wade was being overturned. And so on my timeline, a lot of women I follow, a lot of women I admire were saying very important things. One of the prevalent themes of that day was where are all the men right now? We need men to speak up. Men are being awfully silent. Here comes Mark, who wants a PlayStation 5 for 50 bucks? The skirts are dealing with something. Come on, boys. Let's play video games. And for the record, I am pro-choice. I think that's a pretty easy way to go about it. You're a woman. You're pregnant. It's your decision. I will also say that if I'm the one that got you pregnant, I know which team I'm rooting for. But it's not my call. That's the problem. Men always want to get involved. We look at everything in terms of competition, in terms of athletics. So we want to be on the playing surface. But in this particular Paul game, we're not on the playing surface. We're in the raptors just cheering for our side. You know? Good luck, honey. We don't want it. And I just hate. Anytime you have a debate about modern science, some asshole has to say, well, let's see what the Bible has to say about this. And it's like, oh, god, here we go. And like, I have nothing, I have a lot against the Bible. I shouldn't say that. Look, I think the Bible's fine. I think it's a great prequel to Lord of the Rings. Here's the problem. I just hate when religion messes with science, because it's never the other way around, right? Science never messes with religion. Nobody's ever been caught sneaking a microscope into church. Never hear a priest make a baptism. Like, I now baptize you in two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen. No, it's always the other way around. And I hate when religion messes with chicken restaurants. Y'all know exactly the one I'm talking about, because it's Saturday night and you got about an hour to get there. Chick-fil-A closes on Sundays, which makes no sense as a business, because it's not going to make any of us more religious. I know not the only idiot that has rolled up to a Chick-fil-A on a Sunday hung over. Like, oh, right. God, damn it. Nobody's going to Chick-fil-A on a Sunday. See that they're closed and be like, oh, well, I guess we'll go worship. I don't need waffle fries. I just need one wafer and some grape juice. That'll tighten me over. And Chick-fil-A is just closed on Sunday. That place looks like it hasn't been open in a hundred years. It's a horror movie. There's like tumbleweeds in the parking lot, window shot out, old guy in a rocking chair. We don't get many visitors, no more. And I'm not saying the Bible can't teach us some stuff about modern life. For instance, the very first Karen is in the Bible. Yeah. Very first book, Book of Genesis. You got Adam and you got Eve. And God said, okay, Adam, Eve, here's the deal. You can do whatever you want in paradise. There's just this one tree. I don't want you to touch. You're going to be a fool and Adam's like, God it. And Eve was like, I'd like to speak to a manager. I just feel like if you're going to make a law that covers women's bodies based on belief, it needs to be the belief that every woman subscribes to. So make abortion legal only when Mercury's in retrograde. I might have had one of my female friends write that joke. I don't know. I'm not believing that shit, but I did wait until it was out of retrograde to tape my special. So. Now, the real problem I have is the guys in the room. Many guys who are anti-abortion, I don't understand that. If you're a dude in this room and you're anti-abortion, you need to go to Disneyland. Because you'll be in there for what? Five seconds. Jesus, they're everywhere. I feel so bad for the families at Disneyland. There's two kinds of people that go to Disneyland. You have the families and then out here in California, we grow these weird Disney adults. And God bless them. I don't know where the money comes from, but it's going to mouse ears and turkey legs and they're having a damn good time. And they're just walking around enjoying Disneyland. And then you have the families and it's always the moms doing the hard work, right? It's always the moms. They've been training for this all season long. They have like nine fanny packs. This is a military operation. They're barking out orders of their kids, fast-passed churro, doughwhip, go, go. Where's dad? Dad's always trailing by 20 yards, pushing a stroller with nothing in it. There's no beer anywhere, really. And this is weird thing because every day at sundown, the families are trying to get out of Disneyland and that's when the Disney adults start coming in. And so you have this battle, the bastards, between the two. It's just an army of strollers versus a batallion of trust funds coming at them. And again, it's just like watching the families walk out of Disneyland. Here's what I propose. I think as you exit Disneyland, you should be able to take a left and go to parking or take a right and get a bisectomy, right then and there. Honey, you get the car. I got one more ride. I got to go on real quick. And make it part of the fun. You know what? Goofy perform it. Put a sign up, Mr. Toad, D'Arology. And you're getting the office. You're waiting. The seven door smart chin. Doc gives you the anesthesia. Here comes Goofy in a smock. A hook? You're done. Mickey's waving to you. Oh, we both talk like this. And it's Disneyland. So on your way out of the office, you get a picture of yourself getting a bisectomy. This is one of those weird corporations, though, that liberals and conservatives kind of hate at the same time. Over the same subject just for different reasons. Like last year, we got that Buzz Lightyear movie. And both sides hated it. Conservatives thought that Buzz Lightyear made every kid an American gay. Not sure where they based it on, but that's what the belief was. And liberals were like, where was Buzz Lightyear on January 6th? But you can't hate Disney. You can't. They own everything we've ever loved. Like for instance, for me, big Star Wars fan. We got Star Wars fans here. There we go. I love Star Wars. Favorite Star Wars character, sir. Who you got? It's Jar Jar Banks. Really? Hey, look, I am not going to hate on Jar Jar, but if that's your first round pick, how's your fantasy team doing this year? So if that's, he drafted the kicker in the first round. I'll give you a joke. So it's not Jar Jar. Who is it? Luke Skywalker. There you go. That's a born and bred hero. He's in my top five. I like Leia. I like Shoei. Who is my crochips? Um, but my favorite Star Wars character of all time, Yoda. We love me some Yoda. Not the baby. We all remember the last joke. Not the baby. I like OG Yoda. I like Yoda. And it's not because Yoda's wise. It's not because Yoda's powerful. I love Yoda because Yoda's 900 years old. 900. Yoda's a 900 year old man. Not one sexual assault allegation against him. Not one. He's been on the Jedi Council for 700 years. Never a secretary. Never a Christmas party. Never a road gig in Jacksonville. Legal she looked. Never happened once. You wait as a managing into Dan from Yoda in the middle of the night. Yoda says, up you? Yoda's on the straightener, a man he never got tag hash to me. All the jokes you're going to see tonight, that was the hardest fucking one to pull off. That would have mucked it. That's syntax. It's something special, man. And I am not a Jedi. I do know this about Star Wars. The fans are spoiled. Like you fans that are so spoiled. Because you have 12 movies. You have a new episode of ATV show every week and you still find flaws. You're like, I don't know. That speeder is bright pink, really? Is that what we're doing? Why don't you take the door in back to my era when I was a kid in the 90s when we had to read new Star Wars. Yeah. And we actually had to read it. Now you game of Thrones fans who claim to read the books. Game of Thrones fans. They love telling their friends they read the books. They buy the books, they put them on a night shelf, and then they listen to the books in audio form. You didn't read the books. You had them read to you, like an infant. My niece and my nephews, they're super into Harry Potter. They love Harry Potter. So much so that this past Halloween when the Ellis family went trigger treating together, we all had to go as Harry Potter characters. And guess who got to be the person of honor? Yeah. And niece, she asked me the day before Halloween. She's like, Uncle Mark, we talked about it. And in my head I'm like, shit, is this an intervention? And she's like, we want you to be Harry. And yeah, it was so cute. And I knew I was going to break her heart because I said yes, and I'll do everything I can to pull off Harry Potter. But she's seven. She's expecting the kid from the movies. She's not expecting middle aged burned out. He hasn't cast a spell in 30 years, Harry Potter. Still wearing his Gryffindor robe, it gets a high school varsity jacket. But Harry Potter, I'll give it credit, man. Adults love that too. And I think it kind of still works. Like there's some things that we all love to kids that just don't work when you're a grownup. He, man, great example. You would not find a better fan of He, man than I. I was the biggest He, man fan when I was five years old. Other things I enjoyed when I was five included eating my own bookers and having my mom wipe my ass because I don't know how to do it yet. But my buddy called me. He's 45 years old. He called me a couple of Easter. He's like, man, they're making a new He, man movie. How exciting is that? And I'm like, well, I'm an adult. So I just don't think it works, especially in modern times. The name He, man. It's a little pronoun specific, don't you think? Maybe call it He, maybe. A person? Sometimes characters just let you down though. Like the biggest let down for me was Batman. And I'm not talking about the movies, like all the movies are cool, but just actually knowing the character. This happens a little ways back. There was an animated show in the Batman universe about the character, Harley Quinn. And the writers put a joke in there about Batman. They said Batman was going down on Catwoman and Water Brothers nixed the joke. They said Batman doesn't do that. Yeah. Apparently Batman is the DJ colloid of superheroes. He doesn't go south of the border, okay? And it's like their official quote was, good guys don't do that. And if that's true, that means get the hand basket because I'm going to hell. I'm telling you, you ladies cheer and that's great, but it's really better for both parties, okay? Sex is fun, but that's where babies come from, so I'm nervous. And when you're having sex, sometimes you open your eyes at the same time. It's like, oh, hey, you're just, okay, I'll close first. There's just weird rules to sex. Like it's the most fun thing you could on earth yet. You're a creep if you smile during it. You know, just let me do my thing, you do your thing. Give me the canary, I'll go down below and then you ladies can focus on what you do well. You can work on the acting performance of your career. And I'm down there getting work done because going down doesn't, it's not like a talent thing, it's just a heart thing. It's just a pretty, gutty, every word you associate with white athletes. That's what going down is. You know, just try your best and just never give up. And that's why Batman's mopey all the time because he can't please a woman. Apparently, the world's greatest detective can't find the clitoris. So he's just at home with Alfred watching blue bloods night after night. Meanwhile, Joker's out there, Robin Banks having fun, eating ass, getting things done. You know, as you all let me talk more, you realize why I'm single. Which I'm not only do I love being single, I think all my married friends actually love that I am single because all the females that I'm friends with that are married, I'm their little experiment. You know, if they love trying to set me up with somebody and my dude friends, they adore me because I'll get a text like, hey man, what are you doing right now? And I'm like, well, it's 2.30, so I'm watching ESPN and then I'm going to go take a nap. And they're like, can I come over? Can I nap with you? Like every couple, sometimes you just need an outlet. I'm your wingman. Come on over. Yeah, remember what it used to be like because I don't know if it's going to happen for old Uncle Mark. I don't. And I don't really care about it because we all know that like person who they're in a serious relationship, they break up and then they're just not themselves until they meet somebody else. Like I have a friend, they broke up and then the next week they met somebody new, they're already saying I love you, they're playing a trip together, that's not my speed. Okay? I break up with somebody, I need to go to six, seven years to really think about what happens. You know, where she went wrong. I do like the dating event though. Like dating, it's an event for me. I get up for it, I get excited about it. First day with me, awesome. You have a great time on the first date. I have some funny stories. I'm charming. I can usually cover the bill. Second day, that's when it starts to go downhill. Second day, you're like, he really likes Van Halen. Third day, you're like, he fell asleep at the table. Can I leave? I don't know what to do. Yeah, and you know, I think it just doesn't make sense for me to settle down now when we're so close to interplanetary travel. Who knows when it could happen, but if you think when we can just go live on another planet, if you think I'm dragging some earthling up there with me, no man, I want to be like Star Trek. I want to live long, prosper and Captain Kirk some hot alien ass. That's the dream. My mom is thrilled that I don't have kids. So much so that I'm like a little offended. Because she'll say things to me that she will not say to her other two kids. My sister has one kid. Great. My brother's got two kids. Awesome. I got a dog and she's like, are you sure you're ready for that responsibility? The kids in general, they just like, I just feel like we're past the Golden Age with kids. You know, like the 1600s. That was... That was how you do it. The 1600s, you can have 10 kids. Two of them make it. Your father of the year. There was no pressure about modern society. There was no worry about school shootings or virtual reality. You had one rule back then. Don't talk to the person. Everybody had a farm. There's fun animals. Just that one, good boy. I had one, we think it's a witch. Don't talk to that one. The Quaker wrote, guys, said it, put a curse on us if you looked at it. So don't do that. Now, man, kids. I just don't find a lot of good reasons to have kids. I'm not sure. One of the ones that you used to hear is, oh, I need to propagate the species. There's eight billion of us on Earth. Earth was a fight club that Fire Marshall would shut it down. How the body is like, oh, I just kind of wanted to kick his acute. If you think kids are cute, you've only seen the first 10 minutes of grandma. The best though is one of my friends has four kids. He's like, I don't know, man. I just wanted something to give a legacy to me. He literally said, I just want something to outlive me. I'm like, dude, you wanted a turtle. All right, turtles are much cheaper. Kids will eat you out of house and home a turtle. One head of lettuce keeps it satisfied for like a decade. You want kids, but you're on a budget turtle. Yeah, it's a funny situation my family took is like, currently there's two single people left. There's me and my mom. And I do it okay, but my mom is out there. She travels the world. She meets interesting people. But sometimes it happens where you don't expect it. She started hanging out with a guy who lives up the street. And we've had that house for 30 years. He's been there for 30 years. We have both been in that neighborhood for so long. When I was a kid, I took his daughter to a couple high school dances. Yeah. And remember, boys, going to pick up your date, so nerve-wracking, because you're in your suit, your sweaty, you're wearing the doorbell. You know she's not answering. She's got to do her bell beauty in the beast, walk down the stairs. So it's the dad. He needs to open the door and he's like, you have her home by 1030 young man. I'm a kisser. So this past Thanksgiving I was home. And guess who came to pick my mom up? Yeah. Oh, I was waiting. It was 3.30 pm and I was just sitting in a rocking chair waiting. He rings a doorbell, I answer and he's like, hey Mark, I'm here to take your mom out. I'm like 1015 motherfucker. You have no idea how weird it is to call someone a motherfucker and have it maybe be accurate. She's seeing this other guy too who has Netflix. And I don't know what my mom does. I think they're just friends. But I don't know if they Netflix and chill or they paramount plus and snore. Whatever they do is fine. But she said he has Netflix. And when I tell you he has Netflix, I mean, he still has Netflix. Send DVDs to his mailbox. I shit you not. Did anybody know that was still an option on the table? They used to be the whole business model. Now it's just the one cubicle in the corner. It's like, well, we can't fire Todd. He's the boss's kid. Give him a bunch of those envelopes to play with. And I don't long for that era. I don't long for the era of getting DVDs in the mail. I miss the previous era when the whole family would pile in the car Friday night and you go to Blackbuster Video. That was a big night. Big, big night in the Ellis family. Because you drive out there and it was so exciting going to the video store with all this anticipation and you knew you were leaving with your fourth choice. Because we all have the same strategy. You go to the video store, you start new releases, you go A to Z and then everybody disfers this to their favorite section. My sister tried to run a horror movie. Oh, that's going to scare you a little brother. My dad went in action movie. Honey, it's rated R. Mark is trying to rent basic instincts again. That's not going to work. So then he is getting this debate and it ends 30 minutes later with, well, you know what fuck it? Just grab sister act again and we'll all watch that. We went to Blackbuster once. But it was like three towns over. So my town, Williamsburg, Virginia. We didn't have Blackbuster. We had the local video store, video update, which is actually better than Blackbuster because we had all the same sections they had. The video update also had the curtain. Yeah, the curtain, it was always way in the back and it was black with like glitter and weird stains all over it. That was the curtain that led to the adult film section. And you weren't allowed back in there if you were under 18. They had a mirrors or everybody could see who was in there and 12 year old Mark Ellis came up with a scheme. Yeah. So four person operation, me, my buddy is Jack, Brian and Doug. So Jack got a ride to my house. We rode bikes to Brian's and then we rode bikes to Doug's. Doug's dad was a Marine. So Doug took this shit seriously. He comes out of his house. He's 12 years old head to toe camo. He's like, hey man, I couldn't get the sword but I got a knife. We're like, what the fuck are you talking about? So here's what I came up with. My job was to distract the front court guy, right? You know the guy who's always judging you, he's got his picks. That he's sacred. It doesn't matter what you're renting, he's going to say it's not good enough. Like, oh, 2001, a space saw to see Kubrick's other space movie. Have you seen the moon landing? So my job is entertaining that guy. Brian, Jack, they were the lookout and then Doug was the most crucial part of the operation. Doug, GI Joe crawled back there. And he couldn't get back to the magical land of Oz, but he could reach his hand around the corner and he could pull a movie. Only problem was he couldn't see what movie he was pulling. So first time we tried, he pulled Edward Penis' hands. So now we got to watch the movie about a guy with five dicks on his hand, which ended up being one of my top 10 favorite film experiences of all time. Because we put it on at my house where we had all the good snacks and we're watching it. This is like two in the morning and my mom comes downstairs half awake just to get a glass of water. She walks through the living room like, oh, I love one owner, writer. Good night, guys. So then Doug pulled another one the next week. We got cocky and he pulled hot Asian and Asian six. Yeah. Do you know anything about that franchise? That's when it got good. That was their fast-fi. That's not the end of the mission. Now you have to go to another section and switch the tapes out with something we're allowed to rent. So he goes to the family section. First movie he sees, the adventures of Milo and Otis. Don't remember that movie. It's a dog and a cat and they go across the country together. It's a great journey. And the guy work and there are things we can't wait to get home to see this. And the next guy that tries to rent hot Asian invasion six, instead gets the adorable journey of a dog and a cat going across the country together. And it's just such a weird mind-fuck to think all those guys and I came up with that scheme with they have families. And me, I just moved out out to LA and I chased this dream and it's going okay now. But I mean there's a lot of misadventures you get into back in the day. And I used to work at the the world famous comedy store. I used to be an employee there and you do whatever they ask you to do. You park the cars, you clean up the puke, work the front desk. So I drank a lot. And I remember I got home one night and I was hammered and it was my little studio apartment, right? I've since added a whole bedroom to the empire. So whenever you get home and you're drunk, you're some level of one of three things. You're either tired, you're hungry or you're horny. And you don't know which one you are all the time. Sometimes you think you're one and it turns out no you were something else. So a couple of weeks prior to this, I had met a sex worker at a gentleman's establishment. If you're over 15 this room, I met a hooker at a strip club. And so I got her number and she's like, we should hang out sometime and I'm like, oh, we should hang out sometime. And so I get home from the comedy store. I'm hammered and I make two phone calls. And then I pass out. I called her and I called pizza hut. And then I fell asleep. So I woke up the next day. I had a bunch of miss calls and then I got two texts that morning. One was from her and it said, thanks for the pizza, asshole. And then the other one was from the pizza hut guy and it said, dude, anytime you need pizza, you give me a call. Nobody out pieces the hut by out pussy the hut that night. Yeah, but you get older in life and you think, oh, wait, there's more stages to this whole thing than we originally thought, right? Because when you're a kid, you think, oh, I'm going to grow up and meet somebody who don't get married, I'll have kids. That's the end. No, no, I'm here to tell you, if you're still single and you're my age, there's more to life. There's more phases than you were taught. I decided to knew one that I never knew existed. Nobody told me about this, but now I'm in the phase of my life. A lot of my married friends, they're getting divorced. My friends are coming back. If you love something, set it free. And you feel bad for the family or whatever, but you're also excited, right? I got my body back, sweet. But you got to be careful. That's not really your friend anymore, is it? No, it looks like your friend, but they've been through some shit, you can't understand. It's like you took your friend, as you knew them, bury them in pet cemetery, and now they're back. Like, hey, what's up, man? Hey, man, you got any of those PlayStation 5s left? I saw it. That's great. You got any? I do, since you really want to thank you all for coming out tonight. You guys have been a fantastic crowd. This was the exact scenario that me and every other comedian was envisioning when we were in lockdown. We couldn't perform in front of you all night after night. And you just think, when am I going to get to get back here? Because when the lockdown started, I actually was in Vegas, and I had to scramble to get a flight home. So when you're scramble to get a flight home, what era do you use? It's Southwest. Who the fuck said spirit? I need to go from Vegas to LA, and I don't want to go through Cairo to get there. Spirit isn't an airline. It's an escape room. No. You want to fly Southwest. So I flew Southwest. I have money. And I think my letter was like, gee, and I know they went that high. But I'm sitting on the plane in road 38, success. And I'll never forget as long as I live. Like 15 rows ahead of me, a guy sneezed. And for the first time in my life, nobody blessed him. Not one of the three nuns sitting right behind him, blessed him. And it was like a good sneeze, too. It was like that old man sneezed. Like they're really sick or they just found treasure. So he sneezed once, nobody blessed him. We all got silent. He sneezed again, and we murdered him. He's dead. And that story warms my heart for two reasons. One, I got to kill a guy. And two, a couple of months ago, I got to go back to Vegas for the first time since the Pont de Mique. And I got to work there. And it was awesome because Vegas was back and people were gambling. And the insurance for full nose was awesome. And I was reminded that there is a fantasy to doing stand-up that is not the reality. There's a difference. You have your fantasy of what you think the job is, and then the reality of what the gig actually is. So the fantasy of stand-up is that you're going to go on the road. And you're going to entertain audiences, and you're going to make a bunch of beautiful women laugh. And then one of them is going to come back to your hotel room with you, and you make love all night long. Hasn't happened yet. But I've only been doing this 17 years, so there's still time. The reality is you go on the road, you make a bunch of beautiful women laugh, and then you go back to your hotel room alone, and the sex is always happening right next door. I've heard a lot of people have sex. And it's fun now. But back when I was a young comic, it freaked me out. First time I heard it, I don't know how to react. Because when I was a kid, I never heard my parents have sex. I've been a wrestler a lot. Never heard them have sex. Occasionally you see dad take a leak in the middle of the night. Why is he wearing a cape? You know what? He's a wrestler. That's what I'm going with. So first I was on the road, and I had it. I was doing a gig somewhere in the Midwest, and the painting on my wall was vibrating. And what are you doing that situation? Do you call the front desk and complain? Do you ride it out? I was like, look, I'm going to give them 10 minutes, and then I came. So I'm like, oh boy. This has to go away to quickly. So then you just wait another 10 minutes and you bang on the wall. Hey, I'm ready to try again. Sorry about that. First time or. But now I'm a pro. I'm good. Best time I ever heard other people have sex. Which is a great way to start a conversation at a dinner party. Best time I ever heard other people have sex. San Diego Comic Con 2018. Oh, what a time it was. And it was so beautiful because it was nerds doing it. You know? And like the misconception about us nerds is that we don't have sex. That's not true. We don't have a lot. But when we do, you ever see a raccoon eat a filet mignon? It's not going to last long, but man, you'll remember that the rest of your life. So I'm in my hotel room. It's Saturday night. 3 a.m. I'm about to pass out. I hear the door next to me closed. And by this point of my career, I know the difference between like one person and like an excited couple. This was the latter. So these people get back to their room. And the first thing that turned me on that they might be doing something love making like. Was not the sounds of passion. First thing I heard. Music. I heard the faint strains of a classic John Williams theme song. These people got home from being at Comic Con all day. Eating hot dogs, reading comic books. And they said tonight's the night that we make love to Jurassic Park. Yeah. I got out of bed and opened a beer. I was like, this is going to be fun. I'm yelling lines from the movie. Hold on to your butts. Use a condom. Life finds a way. And I knew it was getting good. I knew one of them was about to have the moment because it was loud. The music was swelling on my nightstand. I had a glass of water and it started to ripple. And I tell you that story not to embarrass anybody. No, if you're in LA for the weekend, if you're going on a trip soon with your significant other, I want you to get in a hotel and have the loudest, most boisterous sex of your entire life. I just want you to realize we can hear you too. So make it fun for everyone. All right. Y'all have something that's going to make me laugh. Y'all see always works. Go board game with it. You sunk my battleship. I'm a nerds. Whenever I climb back, I say, Chewie, we're home. Make it competitive and you're winner. Ladies, don't do this thing you usually do, ladies. Don't do the O God. Okay? Oh God. Oh God. God can't hear you. I can't. Make it fun for me. Did you do your favorite fast food jingle right there? Bada-bada-bada! Go political. Epstein was murdered. Make it historical. Oh, right there. Right there. Sixth Semper, Tyranas! My name is Mark Ellis. Thank you guys so much. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a nerds. I'm a nerds. I'm a nerds. I'm a nerds. Currently there's two single people. It's me and my mom. Is that our color? That was so fucked up that you did that for my mom. It's like, yeah. I think my dad's up in heaven. Like, hey, don't talk about your mom being single like that son. Kill the lights. Get rid of the bed. You
Calling in sick for work? That's some of the best acting work we have at doing our entire lives. I was writing on a sitcom last year. I needed a particular day off. You know that way you need a particular day off and you're like, I could ask for that day off. But if they don't give it to me, I'm still not going to be there that day. So I'm going to have to go with a call in sick. It's going to have to call. It's a burden. It's on your own personal calendar. I got a day I got a call in sick. That's the day I got to do my three day acting toilet day force. Because when I call in sick, I don't just call in sick on the call in sick day. I start acting sick around the office two days prior to the call in sick day. I'd say you have like it'll be like a few days before you're going to start pretending you sick. It's the work front that's going to hotel in this happen one time. Like I am when he's like, we're going to be alone on Sunday and I was going to call in sick Sunday. It's just going to be me and you on Sunday already took a look at the schedule. We're going to be getting slammed. So make sure you're ready. And my head I go to him yet. No, absolutely man. I'll be ready. I'm going to be ready. I'm going to be double ready. You have no idea how slammed you're going to be on Sunday. You feel bad but you can't tell him. He always want to be like, yeah, I just want you to prepare for the storm. I'm talking calling and sick on the phone. Well, that's what I do three days prior to the call in sick day. I start acting a little sick. Little things a little cough here and there. Normally I drink coffee but instead I have tea. Do a hard dip with the bag until someone sees and looks and let me see this. Somebody's like, you're drinking taping? I know you have coffee usually. I get it now. Some of my throat. I know. Some of it's going down. And scene. What time I was acting sick though? And the guy's like, well, man, you sound bad. You should probably go home. I think you're getting sick. I'm riding my head. I'm like, no, no, I'll be sick Wednesday. I'm fine today. Wednesday. Wednesday. I don't act much while I'm all really in movies and TV. I did a show once and a director apparently was at the show. He wanted to meet me in the green room. Like he's a fan of yours. He's a important guy. I had very little time. I couldn't even Google him. So I walked into meet the guy and he's like, hey, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Big fan of your work. That's what you say. That's what you say. He's like, thanks. Because I'm a real big fan of you when you're stuff and he goes, do you do any acting? A lot of acting. Like, what's the last thing I may have ever seen you act in? So he said, I just want to be like, hey, this room, two minutes ago. I said, I'm a fan of your work. I don't even know who you are. And you bought that. So we're good. I got it. I get out. I don't think because of your accent. That's why I don't really do a lot of acting. I don't mind. I mean, I have a very thick. Could you tell me, can you tell them from Kansas, sir? I don't mind ever my New York long island accent. It is what it is, baby. But let's be honest, you know, the minute you start talking with it, this accent. Nobody other thinks, oh, it is a genius. I wish I could lose the accent sometimes. That's all. Like, my wife and I went to get a mortgage on the house. We had to get a bank loan before we walked in. My wife goes, when we go in there, try not to sound old Gumbah. That was the note. Don't sound Gumbah. Right away the bank lady comes up. She's like, good afternoon. I'm like, hey, how you doing? Yeah, that's just a walk away to get some. My wife looks at me. How you doing? How you doing? Ah, what do you order in a Peshraway sandwich at a deli?
Alright, let's talk about the Bible. Yeah, the original Bible, the Torah, not your shitty remake. Yeah, I'm not talking about your all-girls-ghostbusters version of the Bible. Talk about the OG shit. Yeah, I was raised Orthodox Jewish. I don't know if you're not aware of that. It's Frisbee Jew, you know, that kind. Second highest level of Jew. Once upon a time I was sitting Jew, or as I called them mortal combat Jews. Yeah, whenever you see you, I just go finish them. No, no, no, no, no, no, I know what you're talking about. It's great. The ones with the, you know, the sideburns, the long, the curly fries as my black friend calls them. Yeah, my friend Miss Patch, who came to visit me in New York. She never seen one. There's very few acidic Jews in the black ghetto of Atlanta. She saw our first weird talk and she just goes like, She was like, ori. She didn't say my name, but she's like, ori. Is that an Amish? No, I mean, yeah, more or less, yeah. It's pretty much the same shit. She goes, what I mean, that's curly fries. And like those are not curly fries. She goes, what they do? And I'm like, first of all, the grammar on your people is on another planet. And by you people, I don't mean black people. I mean non-Jews. Yeah, Jews are racist, but we don't see skin color. We see IQ and income level. That's all I've got to say. Yeah, goi. That's all you guys are. Have you heard that word? Goi. It's Yiddish for non-Jew. Yiddish is like Jewish abonics. Goi means non-Jew. And just so you know when you hear it, you think it's fun and friendly when they're saying it to you. It's not. They're shitting on you too. Goi is a derogatory word. Probably my favorite derogatory word. Yeah, because most derogatory words, they sing a lot, one-racer culture, make them feel bad. Not goi. Goi is the most inclusive of all the derogatory words. So you know how popus that is to have as your term for the other? That means to them it's one tenth of one percent of the world. And then eugh. Various shades of goi. Yeah, dude, I was raised way religious. So I went to a seminary called the Ashiva in Jerusalem for two years after high school. So you go to study if you want to become a rabbi. Uh, spoiler. It did not take. Anybody here raised religious? Somebody kind? Yeah, what were you guys doing, shall we say? What? Jehovah's Witness, hell yeah, dude, the fucking Harry Potter of Christianity. Who else? What do you got? Baptist? What? Wesleyan. That's a new one, dude. I honestly never heard of that one. Is that some kind of Christ? Okay. You fucking Christians are hilarious with your separations. Every other religion is just one thing. Just Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, and there's fucking 31 flavors of Jesus. Lutheran and Baptist and Southern Baptist, which is just like Baptist, but with slavery, I think. So funny. And Catholics think they're the best wines, too. Yeah, they do. They look down on the other ones from an outside perspective. Catholics think they're way better than the rest of Christians. And I'm like, based on what? Besides most child race preer, like what else is contrafire? It's weird. They ask a devout Catholic. I get older. Devout Catholic. I ask if they're Protestant. They'll get mad at you. They'll be like, well, nothing like Protestant. Like, nothing. What's the difference? And they'll hit you with some crazy. Like, we believe Jesus carried the cross way up top. Yeah. And they think he kind of dragged a little bit. It's basically a different religion. You crazy Christians and stupid separations. You guys still religious now? No. Okay. That's good. If you are religious, that's totally fine. It is totally fine. If you say solid chance, you're going to hate the next 68 minutes of your life. So those of you raised religious of any kind. Do you ever think of what they taught you when you were little? Now that you're grown up? Guys, it's all darker than you remember it. It really is. I mean, let's start the beginning. It's the only way to do this. Adam and Eve, you guys all that story? Okay. If you know all that story, this is all going to go over your head tonight. Here's what happened. In six days, God created the world. On the seventh day, He rested. You guys remember this one. And then later, God went to Adam. He's like, Adam, how do you like it here? How do you like the Garden of Eden? And Adam's like, oh, dude, I love it. It's awesome. Plenty of sunshine, tons of animals to fuck. This place is sweet. I was like, wait, bro, are you fucking all the animals? And Adam was like, not all yet. He made a lot of animals. He got to give me some time. By the way, I killed a frog on Tuesday. Yeah, his eyes were picking on his belly. Split it right open. My bad on that one. And God was like, fuck, dude, stop fucking the animals right now. And so Adam was like, who should I fuck that? And God's like, you're a good question. Fair enough. And he's like, tell you why I'm making another person for you to fuck. Humans should fuck humans. So Adam, with no concept of women, right? They're never the woman ever in history before. So when he heard another person was coming, he was just like, sweet. Another dude, I can fuck in the butt. I assume. And God was like, no, you assume wrong. It'll be like a dude, but it'll have like a, like a front butt. And you're gonna fuck the front butt. Adam loved that idea. He was like, sweet. I could fuck the front butt and the back butt. God's like, no, no fucking back butt. I will never change my mind on that. Adam's like, why not? He's like, that's where shit comes out. I don't like your fucking where shit comes out. I think it's disgusting. You can't fuck where a piss and blood sometimes comes out, but not shit. Oh, I mean, Adam's so angry. He's like, why would you make shit coming out of such a good fuckhole? God's like, where else could it come out? It's like, dude, bottom of the foot. I've been thinking about it. Wouldn't be a way in a place. He's shaking out really easily, wiping his abriests. Every puddles of a day. It should be bottom of the foot, dude. And God was like, fuck, yeah, that would have worked. Maybe a week was rushing it. What was the time crunch on that? I never understood that. It's an important project. Take your time. There's nobody waiting for it. This literally nobody waiting for it. So he made Eve. And to make Eve, you guys remember how I made Eve? The rip. Yeah, he got some memories of this. Yeah, he told Adam I got to crack off one of your ribs. I'm sure Adam was like, why is that? The new process for making a thing. Is from scratch no longer available? Did you lose powers, dude? If you're tired, you can take a nap. That zebra's been eyeballing me pretty hard. I got time. You can get it. You can get it. You can get it. You can get it black and white. But he goes, no, I got to crack off a rib. So he cracks out on Adam's ribs. I fuck. Whatever. I bring it out. He makes Eve out of that rib. And that's the reason my rabbi's always told me that's the reason that men have one less rib than women have. Like, they're all way back to Adam and Eve. Yeah. Then I grew up and found out that we have the same matter ribs. There's a lie. They're told little Jewish kids. I don't even know what they had to gain. You know how embarrassing it is to find out you were wrong about that at 41 years old. People were like, why would you think it's been a different amount of ribs? I don't know when I was nine. So I've got a beautiful dance of told me. So after Adam and Eve and Moses and Noah, a few other Bible stories that Jews and Christians kind of share, you know, at that point, kind of split off. Well, no. We stayed right where we were. He split off. You guys wrote an unauthorized sequel. In fan fiction. But just you added a superhero. I don't know where. You have all these miracles. You got to speed on miracles. I'll give you that. You got to speed on miracles. We crushed you motherfuckers on holidays. We got a lot of holidays. What's the biggest Jewish holiday? What do you think? Son of a gun. Very good. Goi. Idiot stupid. Wrong. Don't goi. Don't like all of them. People think it's Monica because it falls around Christmas and we do presents and stuff. Just so you guys know, it's one of our lowest level holidays. Monica is not even our top 40. For real, it's on the level of like, arbor day for your people. It just feels big because it falls around that time. Presents, by the way, is not even really part of Hanukkah. That's us copying you. Presents on Hanukkah is a modern, western civilization part of the holiday. My dad grew up in Romania before the Holocaust. They didn't do presents back then. That's here in America and England. It's all these Jewish kids. It's all their Christian friends getting presents. And they wanted in. Yeah. And when Jewish kids want free shit, Jewish kids get free shit. So they went to their dad's like, Dad, how come Christopher gets presents and I don't get presents? And their father's like, This is it. More or less that. So now we do presents. Eight days of presents. It's an eight day holiday. Oh, some people think it's eight times the presents you guys got. It's not. We have the same amount of parents you have. We just space them out over eight days. We get better presents than you. You know, because we're far richer than you are. I don't know, kind of white trash presents you've always got. We got like a grilled cheese sandwich wrapped in a shopping bag. You know, what did you guys get? Like sock full of pills? Host car from your dad, bringing it to your mom's handwriting. But yeah. Same amount of presents though. It's supposed to get one present a day for eight days. And then if you have like nine or ten presents, you just double up a day or two. So one year, I didn't have eight presents. I only had seven presents. My mom didn't know what to do to get me every day of presents. Instead of just getting one extra present, you know, like wrapping avocado, you dumb bitch. Instead, her fix was to split a present into two and wrap each half separately. Like I wouldn't know. Like I open up day one's present. I was like, oh, it's skateboard wheels only. I wonder what's in Tomorrow's flat oval box. She said, you'll never guess. I'm like, it's for sure a skateboard, mom. I'm the second smartest race in the world. And this is very easy to figure out as it is. Korea. Here's a story of Hanukkah. I'll tell it to you. So you can talk about this in December with your bosses probably at work. A long time ago, the Jews got kicked out of Israel, okay? One of the many times that happened over history. We are historically, we are the weakest race in the world. Anybody wanted Israel just fucking took it. For real, Greeks, Romans, people from Alabama. Like it doesn't matter, dude. Anybody's like, get out of here. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. All right. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Don't give me 30. So fucking defeated. I hate it. Ugh. Here's what I don't really do with impressions. Here's my only impression I do. It's a sound of the soul of a Jew. Ready? Yeah. All our stories are about survival. Whenever about succeeding. No, we said, like, watch out, the Jews are coming. Yeah. Oh, Palestinians, we got them. All right. We broke our losing streak on that, for sure. Dude, I saw this free Palestine march last summer in New York. And they were all like marching at a big free Palestine sign. But the Palestine part was covered. People were like in front of it. So I couldn't see that part. So I just saw the first half. I'm like, run across the street. What did I give? Oh, no. Like, this is the worst place for me to be. Oh. I'm so sorry. They're all staring at me. I didn't know what to do. I just started scrambling. I was like, oh, I'm just headed to a little Palestine to get some Palestinian food. They're all like, there is no little Palestine. And if you ask Jews, there's also no big Palestine. There's no big Palestine. Yeah. So it's the Greeks. The Greeks drove us out to the Hanukkah story. We were gone for about 100 years and we came back. They laughed. They were like, this place sucks. They took off. So they laughed. And then they really, they fucked up our temple. Our main church, pretty much. They like messed. I don't know what they did. They knocked over chairs and they, yeah. They spray painted dicks on the walls. But the main thing they did was they used our oil canals. It was to keep lit all the time. That's oil candle. And they only had one day's of the oil left. And new oil was eight days away. And they're like, what are we going to do? How are we going to keep lit? And the Jews are like, I don't know. Fuck it. Light it up. Let's see what happens. And somehow one day's of the oil lasted for eight days. And that is when Jews learned how to be cheap. A miracle of honor, everybody. Yeah, that camel's the miracle of honor. Dumbest miracle in the history of organized religion. New Christians, man. Your miracles are the dead. You guys got great miracles. God, when I start, when I, so I left my religion, I switched to a secular college, University of Maryland. And I met all these Christians. And they told me about, about Jesus. And I was fucking blown away. They were like, he walked on water. And I was like, that's impossible. I've seen water before. So sell it to somebody else. And I'm like, yeah, it's a miracle. Like, oh. I'm like, he didn't get wet. Like, I mean, maybe since flashback on the sandal. But I don't think Jesus was waterproof. You know, if he dragged his foot, yeah, probably a little bit of water. But for the most part, pretty dry. I was like, damn. Was that his best trick? Like, oh, no. He's not his best trick. His best trick, my fart. He died and he was like, nah. And everybody's favorite trick was turned water into wine. That dude, man, and the people, for sure. I heard about that. I was like, what kind of wine was it? And they're like, are you literally the first person to ever ask that question? What a nitpicky, chewy thing to worry about. You get free wine in a water and you're still complaining. And you're like, well, I don't want to dry wine. I don't know. See if Jesus could do a malt back. Just ask him. But then they're like, what about you, Ari? What's the juice big miracle for the holidays? I'm like, oh, okay. Well, we had this candle. And it lasted hell along. Yeah, our miracles were more like you had to be there miracles. Yeah. People came into the synagogue and two days later, it's like, is that fucking Kimmel's look on? One more day, that's a fucking miracle. I swear to God, that's a miracle. One more day. That's a one day candle. Jesus just like royes. And you're like, what the fuck? I believe Jesus came back now. He would turn sand into Molly. Yeah. That it would be the best, Molly. You know, if somebody's like, hey, I'm doing me, like, well, you got to test it, man. There's fentanyl going around. You can't just do whatever. Where did you get this from? Like, from Jesus Christ, the Lord and Savior. Yeah. How good would communion be if you were hitting you with a fucking Molly tab? Like, look, come on. God. By the end of the sermon, you'd be like, this guy cares about us. Yeah, Hanukkah is not our biggest holiday. And it's not Black Friday. I heard that, too. Yeah. Pass over. You're not, this is a big holiday, but it's not our biggest one. Pass over commemorates when the Jews left Egypt, where slaves in Egypt, I don't know if you guys knew about that. We recovered. What a fun story that is. Here's the basis of the story. Some woman, you know, she was a slave and she had a slave son named Moses. She raised like a slave. So she just took off, fuck it. Half-court shot. She was like, I don't know, I'm gonna think outside the box here. How about we just chuck it in a river? We'll put it in a little basket. And we'll throw it into the crocodile infested Nile River. And hope for the best. And man, she switched it. Baby did not agree by crocodiles or tip over. It went right to the Pharaoh's daughter. The Pharaoh's daughter, the king's daughter. I was like, I love you. I'll check our around, baby. So she raised it like it was her own. She raised this Moses. I don't know how he knew his original name, but she's the same name. Who said it? It's Lucky Coencinus on that. Betchy was 1920 years old and went to his grandfather, the Pharaoh. The king, he was like, hey, motherfucker, I got news for you. Much of grandson. And the Pharaoh was like, yeah, my daughter was never pregnant. We know. She didn't ever do that. Plus, you're balding with glasses, so... I think you came from slave island over there. That's my favorite part of the story. The Jews were slaves in Egypt. Egypt was a superpower. And their labor force, their manual labor force, was the weakest, most complaining people in the world. I mean, there's nobody softer than Jews. I think the pyramid's supposed to be houses and the Jews are like, it's too hot. Just pile it up. What a terrible, terrible choice for slave. By the way, Egypt is in Africa. There's better options out there. I'm just saying, who do you want picking up stones for you? To Kenbei Mutambo or Gilbert Gottfried? It's so wrong, Egypt. That's why countries fall in a part right now. Let me tell you everything you need to know about you. I don't know where to start. I never know where to start. Let's start with women. Women in Orthodox Judaism are second class citizens. Yeah, you're not a full part of religion. But, by the way, I can feel you turning on me. I didn't make any of this up. It's better than a lot of religions. Like, you can't beat your wife in Judaism. But if you do beat your wife, they'll be like, don't do that. You're just not really a full part of the religion. Like, if this is a synagogue, it'd be all the men down here, and the women will be up there behind a fence. Like, and about looking at us, participating. What are you guys doing back there? Like, shut up. We'll talk to you later. So, those laws associated with being a woman, especially a married woman. If you're a married woman in Judaism and you're on your period, you're considered unclean. Yeah, which, that's actually... I'm not a problem with that spiritually, but physically, that's actually a very nice way of describing what's actually happening. Unclean as far. I mean, like, legitimately, if I put two giant buckets on the stage, and one giant bucket said, clean vaginas. And the other giant bucket said, unclean vaginas. And then I handed each of you a bleeding vagina. And I said, put that anywhere. Which bucket do we all know would be overflowing with vaginas? So, you're unclean until you stop having a period, then you have seven days of no blood, and then you got to a ritual bath called a mikva, and then you consider cleaning again. And it's seven days of no blood in a row. That means if you get spotting two days out, fucking... Yeah, clock starts over, bitches. Yeah, it's like microwave popcorn. It's got to be the full three seconds, so it just not counted. And I was like, pop, one, two, pop, what pop, what? Pop, what pop, what? Pop, what pop, what? Two, pop, what pop, what pop, what pop, what pop, what pop, what pop, what? Pop, what pop, what? Pop, what? Pop, what? Pop, what? Two, three, yes. All burnt. That's a vagina, it's a Judaism, just so you know. It's a microwave popcorn in body parts. And while you're unclean, you can't touch your husband, and your husband can't touch you. Oh yeah, you can't even sleep next to each other. You gotta go sleep in the corner, like the bleeding whore that you are. It's every month with you. So this law, it's called Nida, this is the reason, this is the sociologically, this is the reason that Orthodox Jews have large families. It's not only so you can fill up our minifants. There's another reason for it. It boils down to this. How long it appears last? What it appears to go for these days? Five days, okay. She's heavily disagreeing with you in the back. So what do you think it is? Seven, set the mansplainer? All right, let's flip it over. It's five to seven. That's why I thought that was gonna be a woman saying the answer to that. I know. Five to seven days, I believe she said. Plus seven days of no blood. That's 12 to 14 days, okay. Plus another day or two to go to the ritual bath. It's not like 24 hour fitness. You know, the only answer in the spots. So now we're talking about, right about 13 to 15 days after such a period is the first time you're allowed to touch your husband. It's also when you are the most fertile in your cycle. Your ovaries are right at the bottom of your pussy. And you haven't touched your husband in two weeks, and he hasn't touched your supposed super horny and right then, God's like, ha ha ha, go! I mean, there's no chance, dude. There's no chance. Imagine the husband's home washing dishes, comes, come out of his ears, fuck, hate this religion so much. She's gonna boot his sputus fuck all the time. All the kids are like, daddy, just fuck off, daddy's not gonna move like that. God, fuck, hate this shit. You can't beat your kids in Judaism, just so you know. That is a lot. You can't beat your wife, but you can beat your children. And right then, the woman walks to the door, you know, the guys all cranky, just fucking pent up, and he's just like, where have you been? She's like, ritual bath, and he's like, oh yeah? Why don't you go get that sheet with the hole in it? There's a rumor just so you're out. There's a rumor that Jews have sex through a hole in a sheet. And it's not true. But it's not not true. So it comes from, it comes from, some racist made it up a long time ago. It comes, I'll tell you where it comes from. Jews have this like sort of prayer poncho thing called seat seat. It goes on, it's like a t-shirt, but it's like made like a poncho. It's like, I have no size, and it's got these white tassels. Something you'll see that, white tassels coming out of it at the bottom, the cold seat seat. And the white tassels are for like, in times of trouble, we would tie razors to the end of that. No, I'm not afraid of fucking bubble of safety. But anyway, I guess some lady was like washing the families to seat, and she was hanging them up the dry, and some racists walk by. I do say what you want about racists, they're not the best people in the world, but they are very creative. Some of them walk by and they saw one hanging up, and they're like, I bet they fuck through that. And it just doesn't, what an even a bad thing, the hole is like that big. So I'm like, yeah, spread that. But then it changed, it morphed, the rumor morphed, into like a regular bed spread with a little hole cutting the middle of it. And here's how strong the rumor was, I thought it was true. Up until legitimately two years ago. I guess they thought like a woman was supposed to lie down naked, and you cover her up with a sheet, like she's dead. And you line the hole up right over her vagina, and then you got to get in there, you know, and like through the hole. Do you guys remember the game Operation? Yeah, it's just like that. But it's still using tweezers, use that sweet D, hate it, fuck it. Yeah, I think actually, I don't know, it might be that way. It might be another way. It might be that the guy holds a sheet like over him. You know, just puts it over there and just has a dick out of the hole. Like like a walking glory hole. Just a dick, I'm like, You know stick, Boone! I don't know. I always thought it was the former, but it might be the latter. Yeah, oh, sorry, but they're not Jews, for the boys. Former and latter means first and second. The reason for the sheet that I always thought was twofold. I thought it was just because these are like super religious people, super pious people, and they're studying the Torah and the Talmud, which is like the Gomorrah all day. And they don't want me distracted, you know? Anybody with a wife or a girlfriend, you know, you think about her naked sometimes. So they're like to combat that, they're just like cover her up with the sheets. You don't want to look at her, she won't be thinking about her. Don't be distracted. And then the other reason is, there's a commandment to be full and multiply. In order to do that, you have to have an erection. And Jewish women... That's the best way to say this. It's not ugly, it's not ugly, that's not the word, that's not the word, it's not ugly. Here's the word I'm going to use. Inbred. Yeah, we're in inbred race, everybody. The boys and the girls. We've only been fucking ourselves for like 5,000 years. So if you don't get outside genetics, shit starts to get weird. As people ask me, is Judaism a race or religion? I'm like it's both. I'm like, well how can it be a race? I'm like, because you can pick a Jew out of a lineup. If you have eight men, you're like the Woody Allen one. Obviously you, come on, come on, let's go. It doesn't look like other religions. You can't pick a Catholic out of a lineup. Unless they're in the middle of raping a child. I mean, you would have to get so lucky with the timing. I guess what you could do, you could have a lineup and then release a child into the room and then lock the door. And then you just gotta play the waiting game. You gotta wait for the one to start shaking and sweating and like talking to him. Keep it together Jeremiah. You guys raping that? I'm not, I just wanna know if you guys are gonna rape that. I'm not gonna rape it. I might even think about raping it. You guys are gonna rape. Hey, can I smell his butt? Is that a love? I've been making fun of that Catholic priestess scandal for like 20 straight years. I can't stop making fun of it. I have Catholic friends. They get mad at me about it, but fuck off. My buddy Steve, he's Catholic, he's a comic. I made a Catholic joke once and he got off stage and he was, he had nothing but, you know. So I got off stage and he was like, What do we have to do to make you stop making fun of Catholics? And I was like, one thing. It's just that one thing. Are you guys not getting the message? Just stop raping children. Do you have a game plan in place to improve? Can I spit ball with you a little? Can I suggest? I don't know, right or wrong, but start raping adults for a while. See how that works out? It's 50, 60 years. I'm like that. And then eventually, maybe no rapes at all. When I think we get all agree, you know you're fucking up as a group. And raping adults is a step in the right direction. Yeah, the only problem is now every time a Jew fucks up sexually, all my friends are like, Well, well, well. Guess you guys aren't perfect either. Yeah, like fucking what's it's a Jeffrey Epstein? That was about, Epstein is a Jewish name if you don't know. If you don't know before, now you're no. You know, Jeffrey Epstein is he was a, he ran an underage sex trafficking ring. Yeah, had his own private island. And he did it. Bill Clinton went there, but just to play golf, I think he said. There was no golf or book Clinton lived, so he went to fuck child island and get a sweet nightholds it. Anyway, they're like, what about Jeffrey Epstein, Ari? He's a Jew, and I'm like, that's fair. And I'll answer that from a Jewish perspective. Here's, here's what Jeffrey Epstein goes to show you. It's that no matter what industry Jews choose to go into, we will rise to the top of that island. He's the number one name in underage sex trafficking. Anyway, the point is Jews have a look. That's my point. Everybody's got to look. I mean continent to continent, people look way different in South America than they do in Africa. Candle, they look different. Even country to country people look different. I've been on tour all the way to Europe. People looked at, I was a dude, I was in Berlin. Four days in Berlin. Hottest women in the world. I've been to Sweden and Brazil. I thought they used to be the hottest, it's German girls. They're fucking tens, dude. Every one of them. And the dudes too, every dude there was like six foot five and chiseled. I just walk around Berlin for four days, they're in the same beautiful men and women. And for the first time in my life, I was like, yeah, I get it now. I guess I never looked at it from their point of view. Germans are perfect. And Jews all look like we're dying. We are, we're falling apart, man. You need outside genetics, their shit starts to get weird. Same as looking at the royal family in England, they're all like, blah, love your leader. You know? They're all half-tards, eating their own shit in the corner. Same as Jews, we're falling apart. Every Jew has the same fucking Jew pattern baldness. You know, that's what God's like. Try to get laid, do something, cover it up if you have to. I don't know. We're falling apart near sightedness. I didn't raise the guy's surgery, I'd still have glasses. Yeah, Dr. Weinberg did a great job. We're on the Rodic, we're like, Taysac's disease, fell on a part. Feed a glass of whole milk to a Jew. Watch him reign diarrhea for 40 days and 40 nights. Absolutely falling apart, because we're inbred. It's kind of like, uh, do you guys know what pugs are? The dog breed pugged the most inbred of all dog breeds. We've ever seen a pug get excited and then struggled to breathe. Throw a ball through a pug four times in a row. Listen to the sound of him, John. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah, that's what Jews are. We're the pugs of the human world. Anyway, the point is, we have a look. So every Jewish woman I've ever had sex with, this has been like 10, 12 of my life and everyone, for a moment, or the whole time looking at her, but at least for one moment I'll look at her and she looks exactly like my aunt Ruth. And my boners like no fucking way. So to combat that, I always thought they just were like, well, why don't you just take a sheet, cover her up. Yeah, they just fucking multiverse of holes and you're hucking there. By the way, here's what I study. There's two types of Jews. I'm only talking about one type. There's Ashkenazi and Sphari. So when the Greeks drove us out or the Romans are one of the fucking thousand times we got driven out, we got pushed in different directions. And some of us went north to like Poland and Romania and Hungary and places like that. And some of us went east to like Syria and Iran, Iraq, places like that. Those are called Sphardic Jews. So there's my grandmother called them animals. She's like, they don't cut their hollah, they're taric. They don't have them in our house. And those people are tougher. They're tougher Jews because they got some Arab in them and they're just like tougher. They never had the Holocaust, too. So there's no victim mentality there. The Holocaust never got to Syria. So they were all like, what? Why are you victim? Just fight back. You just wouldn't understand. But I'm talking about Ashkenazi Jews. What do you want to choose? That's a type I'm talking about. So let me tell you what we did in Seminary in Shiva and Jerusalem. All we did was study the Torah and mostly the Talmud, the Gomara. I'll use those words interchangeably. It means the same thing. And we prayed. Three times a day we prayed. It's a lot. Most of them go five times a day. You got us on that. Christians play like twice a year. And the Talmud is really just a series of what-ifs to help codify the law. So the Torah will say something like, like, thou shalt not kill. You get put to death if you kill. But the Talmud is like, what about self-defense? And you're like, yeah, good question, Talmud. Good question. So here's to my favorite what-ifs from the Talmud. And these would still be done today. My favorite too. Okay, what if you have insects with your wife and in the middle of it, she starts a period. You know, that could happen. I know women, whenever I've had sex with a woman and she's like, oh, shit, it's not my period. Then we was getting embarrassed. Which is weird. Like, ooh, it's not my period early. But I'm always like, oh, did you? I can't even put on him. It's a cow. It's a cow. No. And chicks always getting embarrassed by it. They're like, uh, sorry, don't get embarrassed. At least from my perspective, I'm always like, I love it. You know, I started my period. Like, that's right, you started your period early. Because I hit that back wall. My dick starts your period. My dick is your god. My dick is your mood. Makes us feel powerful. Don't feel bad about it all. So, uh, what if you start your period early? I would say, you know, just stop fucking. No big deal. If I was the ancient robbers at a time, or keep fucking, you already got the sin, you may as well enjoy yourself. You know, it's like if you get a parking ticket, you don't move your car. Park for free for the rest of the day. That's not what the rabbis of Gamara say. They said, uh, no, you're not doing anything wrong until you find out you started your period. And then when you're inside of vagina, you can't pull out. Because pulling out is a stroke. It's an enjoyable stroke. So, where are you gonna go? It's like, it becomes like a Chinese pussy trap, you know? So, this is what they say to do. This is what they say. I think in your, uh, your diet or mama karma, one of those. But you're fucking, right? And then that, she goes, I start my period. You're supposed to stop, look up, think of the glory and all of God. Until your manhood subsides. Yeah, you have to let your dick exit of natural causes. Oh, what a fun bonding moment for you and your wife. For her to feel you go soft inside of her. And how confusing, for you to have a dick point of you, you're just plugging away, you know? You're just like this. And then all of a sudden, it just stops. Hello? Hello? Little movement, please. Little movement here. I'll definitely stop thinking about God. The twig, the twig, the twig, the twig. All right. Well, probably gonna get out of here then. Here's my favorite, here's my all time favorite, what if from the tall one? Uh, it's about, it's about dietary laws. We have kosher. You guys have heard that word, right? kosher? Yeah. Certain things we can and can't eat. And that's what we call kosher. Muslims have halal. Christians just go buck wild. So you can't mix meat and milk. No, the mix meat and milk. The reason for that is God is a cunt. Can't even go into it. But like, uh, so I never had a cheeseburger. Tell us 23 years old. Never had a cheeseburger. Yeah, it's weird. Weird upbringing. You know? The closest I got was I had a hamburger and then six hours later, I ate a slice of cheese and then I was like. I had a couple of cheeseburgers coming out, but never go into it. Also no, no pig products of any kind. No pork, no bacon, no ham. Not a lot of it all. Um, actually, it's fun because I took my nephew for his bar mitzvah. I took him to a New York Ranger game. Um, bar mitzvah is a Jewish coming of age ceremony. You've heard that. It's like Mexicans have keen scenarios, I guess, for a little girl's. Uh, it's when a, Bar mitzvah is when a Jewish boy becomes a man. And that's when he can read from the Torah for the first time. And they'll let him on his own, a victim family out of their homes. Uh, you know, all by himself. Um, and so for his bar mitzvah, I took my nephew to a Ranger game. My, my orthodox Jewish nephew and, uh, doing first intermission and went and got concessions. And I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. And he was like, uh, uh, I'm like, I don't know what to tell you to do. When you're 19, you get fucking come out of this dumb cult. But until then, I told your mom you'd be good. So enjoy your French fries, loser. But you got to understand he's never seen bacon before. 13 years old has never been to a non-Cosha restaurant. Why would he? He's only friends with Jews. He's only going to hangs around with Jews. He's never seen bacon. He's never smelled bacon. Never touched bacon. And he just had questions. Look, I was already the cool uncle, you know. My fuck hookers, I do drugs. A dude bacon? I think he was just like, I'm Galari. What, what is bacon taste like? And I'm like, oh, it's the greatest thing in the world. How do you even explain bacon to someone's neighbor? It's like, you have no jumping off ground to understand this. It's like explaining for you. You know, or hardship to a millennial. He was like, my mom said it tastes like roast beef. She's a liar, dude. Your mom's a liar. It's my little sister. I knew it a long time ago. I thought she stopped lying. But now I know she's still doing it. He's like, why do you think she's lying? Because she's never had bacon. And I've had both bacon and roast beef. So I'm the expert. I'm a real man. I'm a real man. And I've had both bacon and roast beef. So I'm the expert here. And he goes, well, so you don't like roast beef. You're missing the point completely. Roast beef is fine, dude. But next to bacon, roast beef is like making out with Madonna now. So we have these kosher laws. And so here's my favorite, what if in the tall one? What if you're making some soup, okay? Let's imagine a big vat of soup in the town square. In Jesus' times Jerusalem. Can you picture it? Some guys making this fucking cauldron of soup. And one of these gois. One of these shifty fucking gois. He's just kind of like milling about, you know, just hanging by nearby. What's that goi even doing here? Nobody wants him here. Just shifty, you know? Just bringing down property values. I hate when they're here. And he reaches his pocket. This can't be good. What's his goi going to? He pulls out, yep, some ham. No one's looking. It's breaking. Don'ts the ham right in the soup. He's like, fuck off, Jews. Fuck it takes off. What if that happens? They're eating the soup or not. That's what the tall one was. That's legit. What if from the Gamar? That I studied for three weeks. I was a shiver in Jerusalem when I was 19 years old. I get the other ones. I really do. What if you kill somebody by accident? What if you stab a period into your wife? Sure, sure, sure. What if a rogue goi? Lose his goddamn marbles. Brace to your Jew security. And commits just the saltest act of terrorism of all time. It's a hate crime. Pure and simple. It's a hate crime. But no loss of life. But ooh, what a possible loss of soup. What would it do if it looked up in poly? So if that happens, the Gamar asks, then what do you do? What do you do with the soup? Can you eat it? Or can you not eat it? What do you, not the Orthodox Jews? Everybody else. What do you guys think? Eat it? A couple hell knows. What? Take out the ham. All right, you're thinking. Think it. That's what the Gamar does, by the way. Just teaches you, like, think it out. Logic this out. What can you do? Maybe run it through a sheet. Maybe whatever. You know? But all they did, the ancient robins just discussed it. And come up with the answer. And you're all wrong. You're all wrong. You were never going to get it. The answer is, for sure, you were never going to get this. The answer is, it depends on the ratio of ham to soup. Yeah. And that number? And I don't know why. That number. Actually, if anybody knows it, on the count of three, say it. One, two, three. 60. Yeah. 160. I'm not making it up. Yeah. A lot of you Christians are like, wait, what's going on right now? Did R.E. have 47 audience plans? 160. The law is called Beto Bishisham, the waste of the 60th. And if it's less than 160th, you know, if it's 164th, ham to soup, then the ancient robins are like, hey man, this was soup a little better ham. I never heard nobody. Yum, yum, eat it up. I'm going to get this. I'm going to get this. I'm going to get this. I'm going to get this. I'm going to get this. I'm going to get this. I'm going to get this. Yum, yum, eat it up. But if it's the last water, or a little more ham, it's 159th, ham to soup, then they're like, dude, that's obviously ham soup. Pour it out on the street. Don't give it to the nachos. I don't incentivize them to do it again. Throw it out. Here's the cool thing though. Here's what me and all my friends like tapped into. We were 19 in this issue. We were like, there's the coolest part of the law. The ham in the non-ham soup, if it's 167th, whatever, ham to soup, it's no longer considered ham. Yeah, it's lost its hamness. So you can eat that ham. And that, my friends, is a loop hole that we were all looking for. Yeah. Yeah. Jews do love loop holes. That's what makes them so good. That's what makes them such great taciturnies. We find loop holes when we exploit them. We really do. You know how the women wear the wigs? Loop hole. You ever see the women's wear the wigs? Because it's, okay, you can't covet your neighbor's wife. And they say one of the things you covet is their hair. Hair is an attractive quality to a woman. So you have to cover your hair if you're a married woman. So these Jewish women who were just as smart as Jewish men, they went looking for loop holes. So they went to their rabbis. They covered up our hair with a baseball cap. And he's like, yeah, whatever, do anything. And they're like, can we cover our hair with someone else's hair? And they're like, where are you going with this? No, we proposed to cover up our hair with some hair we bought in China. So it's not us they're attracted to. It's Sung Lee from Shanghai. And the rabbis were like, well played. You can't use electricity in the Sabbath. That's what you know how to do. If it lights on, it's on. If it's off, it's off. From Friday night sundown to Saturday sundown. All shop is long. You can't use electricity. However, you can get a goi to use it for you. You can't ask outright because that's cheating. But you can hint strongly at it. So maybe you have an orthodox Jewish family in your building or your neighborhood. And maybe they talk to you for the first time ever. And they're like, this is odd. You're like, hey neighbor, how you doing? I lived in the next door for the last 25 years. I haven't said how do you ever. Well, it turns out it's very hot out and we left our air conditioning off. And you'd be like, okay, turn it on. I'm glad you brought that up. I cannot turn it on because my God forbid it. However, for goi, we're to do it for me. By then, I can be a nice cool breeziness. That happens on the shop. What you should do is, just go over there and turn it on for them. Be nice about it. And then you'll be known as a shop of scoy. And that is the highest level of goi. Yeah. In fact, actually, if you have next door neighbors or are with their Jews, just go over there and be like, how's your light situation today? I'm part of an orchestra out of my back. Can I help with anything bothering you? Hand-tongued? Don't love you, dude. Don't give me tons of hollah. So anyway, back to a beatual bushing. Back to the waist of the 60th. Me and all my friends were like, that's a loophole we've been looking for. What if one of these gois comes to my mom's kitchen? You know, maybe the Amazon delivery guy. And he's like, hi, Mrs. Chaffir, I need you to sign right there. I'm trying to align if you don't mind. Yeah, just sign. Just right there the line if you don't mind. Hey, what are you cooking back there? Oh, is it some soup you fucking bitch? You know, makes a break for it. We should know his pocket, first pocket ham. But honestly, we thought you guys had ham on you at all times. We didn't know any gois. We didn't want to know any gois. We just thought you guys were like, just in case some juice soup appears. I'm gonna be ready. Fucking dunks it in the ham, fuck off, Jews, you know. And then, case off. Me and all my friends, same exact day trip. None of us were like, I'm gonna go fight that guy. Well, why? You'll lose. There's no reason. No, we all the same day trip. We're going for that measuring cup. And if it's less than one 60th, we're eating ham soup tonight! Yeah, what did you guys do about when you were 19? Same shit or like, different shit? By the way, okay, so you guys, I know I'm painting this picture of Orthodox Jews being like, very instiller and like different. But like, we're not that different than you. It's like just like one step down. You know, we did normal shit. We listened to top 40 music. We could watch movies, regular art movies, even. No nudity, but violence was fine as long as it was gois dying. It was cool. I played basketball as in a basketball team. My league was three Jewish schools, a deaf school, and a Sidwell friends. Yeah, but you had to play with your Yamagon. The girls had to play with skirts with sweatpants underneath. Yeah, but I played with the Yamagon. And what I would do is I clip my hair, my clip on the Yamagon, just one clip. So we were like, move around a little. I'm six foot three. I was at tallest Jew in like nine years of my school. So I was a center. So there's no Jews aren't known for their verticals. So what the fuck am I gonna do? So I get the ball in the post, right? And I go like this, and the Yamaka would like move. And it would put like defenders in a trance. And they would follow the Yamaka. Drop step to the left. The easy doof. Yeah, you gotta use what you got. You gotta use what you got. Yeah, we're like you. Just like one step off. You know, like, okay, like Christians, you know, you don't have premarital sex. But you do it. You just not allowed it. And Jews were not all a touchwomen before marriage. But we, you know, we still did. It was like bad kids. We'd meet girls in the woods behind school. And we'd like hold hands. But as we were doing it, we're like, What a fucking slut. Oh my god. Who would marry her now? It's you, but one step off. That's all. Let me tell you about Yom Kippur. It's our biggest holiday. It's our both somber day in the Jewish calendar. It's a day of atonement. It's part of the Assyria of Aetua, the 10 days of repentance. From Russia, Shana to Yom Kippur. And yet to pay for forgiveness the whole day on Yom Kippur. It's a fast from sundown to the next day sundown. Super somber. God's judging you for your sins. He's deciding on your fate. This is one of my earliest memories. This is me as probably a six-year-old, maybe, first grade. Guys, it's gonna get weird right here. Just so you know. First grade. My dad, before Yom Kippur started, he was like, hey, come with me to the front lawn. We're gonna say his prayer called Kapparot. And he brought with him to say his prayer, a chicken, a live chicken. And I was like, I'm gonna name it big name. Yeah, my dad said, oh, we will not be naming this chicken. Yeah, and I should've said, Dad, what's this foreshadowing mean? Here's our Kapparot works. You say his prayer over and over again. And then symbolically, as you say it, your sins are supposed to kind of like wash off you a little bit. But they don't evaporate the sins. They gotta go somewhere. So, this chicken. Yeah, it's a sin chicken. And it eats sins. I know, I get it. It's very strange. We're not the only culture that does you like that. There's other cultures that are similar stuff. There's a tribe in the Amazon, Central South America. Every three years, villagers come together. They put their sins on a goat, and they fucking kick the goat off a cliff. Yeah. Yeah. Catholics, you tell your sins to a rapist behind a counter. And then... You know, he knows whatever he wants with it. So let's not judge what's weird or less weird. That's all putty fucking out there. And Jews, we got a sin chicken. So six years old, first grade. We're saying Kapparot, we're saying his prayer over and over again. All my sins, you know, my god's it. Fucking eat it, sin chicken. I punch my sister, I stole a pencil. Eat it, sin chicken, you love it. Slurping up. My dad's over there doing his Kapparot, and this chicken's just fucking godless. Fucking cover in this bitch and sins, you know. It's like a buccacchi of regret over this fucking slut's face. God, come on, just Bible talk, you guys. That's all we're doing here. Just regular Bible talk, I've done this before. And then we were done, and my dad was like, all right, symbolically we're white, clean of sin. I was like, oh, it's so cool. Can we go back inside? Yeah, we can go back inside. But before we do, I mean this chicken's got to pay for his crimes. What? Big name? What did big name do? He goes, no, there's no one here by that name, first of all. I already told you that. Second, well, he knows what he did. He punched his sister, he stole that pencil. He gossiped. All my stuff. Look, man, Jews are excellent lawyers. And this motherfucker's gonna hang for his crimes. Yeah, so he reached down in front of me. Six years old, I was screaming for him not to. I was like, no, no, please. And he reached down, he grabbed his chicken by the neck. And if I come down, he didn't snap the neck. He picks it up by the neck. And just start fighting. Oh, yeah, way worse whatever you guys pictured five seconds ago. Far, far, far by bear. Whatever you were thinking is like the way I did not see it coming at all. You know it was more surprised? Big name. You should have heard like, what the fuck? Who's that guy? He was that chicken eight minutes earlier, how are you gonna die? No way, I guess it's correct. Big name, how are you gonna die? That old age, I think, probably old age. He's Jewish, treat me great, you know. He's never guess I'm gonna die by swinging over a Hebrews head. It is some northern African voodoo ritual. The brother was not only my family, wasn't like we were the weird ones. If you drive on this street, see after him before young Kippur, a teen ex-New Jersey, a Skokie, Illinois, or a cat-mill, Maryland, or wherever you guys keep your Johnny Cash Jews. You'll see dozens of them last-rowing poultry in front of their horrified young sons. Then he finished, he threw it down right near my feet, not dead. Just hurt bad. Like knocking him recover bad. You know, taking a wing, trying to get away. Like, blah. Blah, blah, blah. Just trying to get home to see your eggs one more time. Blah, blah, blah. And then you can't even chicken afterwards. Now I'm gonna have the chickens. Cause it's got our scissor on it, so you can't eat it. So, you know what we do with it? You're not, I mean, you're for sure not gonna like this, but... We give it to poor people. We don't tell them about the scents. They were like, here, we have some chicken. Eat it, eat it. No, it's chicken. Go ahead, eat it, eat the chicken. Eat the chicken. Eat the chicken, it's good. Eat it, eat the chicken. It's good, eat the chicken. Yeah, so here's the weird part. Oh. Yeah, that's not the weird part at all. That's not the weird part. That is weird, that's not the weird part. Here's the weird, I took it for granted. Here's the weird part. I went home again for Russia Shana. It's part of the 10 days of repentance. Russia Shana did a Yom Kippur. It's called the Assyria Gimitruva. And I went home again, probably seven, eight years ago. And at this point now, I'm way out of the religion. Okay. When I was like, I guess 22, 23, I had a Christ of faith. And I realized, I realized I didn't believe in God. And that's like a pretty important part of the religion. Actually, it was when I was in that Ishiva, that seminary in Jerusalem. I, um, okay, so I left a light on above my bed, or reading light on above my bed in the dormitories. And it was just in my eye on Friday night, on Shabbat's night. I couldn't fucking sleep. And it was right in my eye. I was getting so fucking frustrated that eventually I was like, fuck this, I'll just, I'll turn it off. You know, and right when I went to turn it off, I was like, some people walked by my window and I'm like, fuck, I'll get in trouble. There's no goiies to help me, you know? Not in Jerusalem. So I was like, fuck. And I didn't turn it off. But then I thought about later. I was like, why would I care if people got me in trouble? You know? I should care about God. And then it hit me and I'm like, eh, why don't believe in God? Fuck. So I'm like, I'm out. I'm done. I went and got my first non-coacher meal, Taco Bell. Yeah. No. Do not clap for Taco Bell. Ever. Oh, I was so like overcome by guilt. I threw up after I ate it. But now that I'm looking back on it, I realized it was not the guilt at all. I just thought that, then. I thought that was real food back then. It's Taco Bell. Never ever eat there. So I left. I had to leave. I had to, my Orthodox Jewish Holocaust survivor father. Yeah. That I was out. Yeah, he didn't. He wasn't stoked. I get it from his perspective. You got to understand. Like, he just sent me to Hebrew school for 12 years. I'm like $15,000 a year. You know, Jews don't love wasting money. I don't know if you heard about us. And then you shave a seminarian Jerusalem at like 30 grand a year for two more years. And then when I got out, I was like, Dad, I need to talk to you about something important. And he's like, you want to become a rabbi, don't you? And I'm like, oh, quite the opposite. I want to tell Dick jokes to drunk people all over America. And he's like, he was mad. He goes, I saw my name believe in God. He goes, even a dog believes in God. You're lower than a dog. Which did hurt. That's how I looked it up. I'm like, what researcher you're quoting on that? So we're fine now. We're totally fine. But I went home again for Rosh Hashanah. The other part of the Ten Days of Repentance. And before it started, he took me to the backyard. And he goes, come to me and say his pair called Tashlach. He brought a loaf of bread with him back to his creek in the woods. He starts tearing off pieces of bread. Sans and prayer, throw it in the creek. And I'm like, what is this? Because I'm out. I don't remember any of this, right? And he goes, oh, well, what we're doing here is we're putting our sins on the bread. And then... And these fish, these sin fish, they eat our sins. It's swim away. Yeah, and dude, all these memories started flooding back. And I was like, wait, is this like that chicken thing for when I was little? And he goes, yeah, good memory. Exactly. They're interchangeable. You could do either one. You were on the option. When I was six years old, you could have fed goldfish with me. And instead, you killed me, Lee. I was like, in hindsight, it was not the best idea. Yeah, but getting out of the religion, man, I thought I'd be like, I thought I'd miss a sense of community and stuff. But now I got my first blow job, and I'm like, oh, hell, yes. I loved it. I experienced new things every Saturday morning. I'm fucking flicking on and off lights. I'm like, uh, you know? In college, I do have LCD. I'm like, making up for lost time. Yeah, but I'm way out now. But there aren't still Jewish stereotypes that, well, maybe you guys know them. So I'm sure you've heard them. You know, big dicks, great lovers. What have you guys heard? Go ahead, throw it out. Jewish stereotypes. What do you heard? Big nose. Cheap. Cheap, sure. A lot of people said that one. Okay. Stinky. Terrible, what? Terrible eyesight, not bad. Moronic? Oh, neuronic. Okay, that I will allow. What? They like to haggle. Yeah, these are all correct. A freight of cats. That's just one Jew you met. No. They control the weather. We do not control the weather. We are working on it, but we're not there yet. We are making plants. Brooklyn, bad at basketball. How about smart, funny, any of the good ones at all? Creative. You guys all want negative, for no reason at all. I don't know. I'm not here to take the wrong words. These are all true. Everything you have said is true. Cheap, big noses. That affects my life. And by the way, we are cheap, but that's only compared to you. You understand? I didn't grow up with you. So maybe I'm cheap compared to you guys, but I'm not cheap compared to Hyman's Shlomo. You know? So we were aware of the stereotype, so I told you we watch movies and stuff, but we just had fun with them. We're very funny people. We just had fun with it. We had this game in high school, we played, called Get It Juice, and the way you play was, if you had a few pennies in your pocket, you could start the game. Yeah, you guys can all play this if you want. Actually, you get fired for sure, do not play it. Don't play it, I'm wrong about that. But any three pennies or more, so any between classes, if you were like, you know, I got some, as everyone's in the hallways, you just go, get it, juice. I just throw it away, and look. Oh, come on. I got a penny, I'm a cheater, I got a penny. Yeah, our rabbis are like, absolutely not. You cannot play that game anymore. Yeah, and now it comes out with a cheap of the big noses. Every time I'm going to party with my comedian friends and cocaine is going around, like as soon as it gets to me, all my friends are like, well, I guess we're all done with the cocaine now. The guy with the biggest nostrils, the less free shit the most, just stepped up to the plate. Come on, guys, come here, some slack out. Here's a modern Jewish stereotype. Jewish women, terrible of blow jobs. It's a real thing. Food me wrong. LAUGHTER Pushy, Jews are pushy, that one I hate. That one's the one I see the most. And that's sfartic and Ashkenazic Jews. We're both fucking pushy, dude. Then there's scusole batches that's happened to us, you know? The Holocaust, that's pretty much it. The honestly not much is going wrong for Jews. But when it does go wrong, it goes off the fucking rails. Actually, off the rails would have been a really good thing during the Holocaust. And we're just saved a lot of lives. But they are pushy. Do you want to tell us Holocaust footage on the history channel? It was showing like, because it goes like shark week and then Nazi month. And so I'm connected to the Holocaust. In a way, my dad's a survivor. My grandfather was a liberator from a death camp. He was liberated from a work camp. Him and his two sisters and his mom survived. Every other great one uncle survived. And like 30 others were murdered. So we're connected to the Holocaust. We heard stories about all the time. So I'm watching this line of Jewish men starved and like going into, I think a gas chamber. I think that's what it was. So they're going to their death and they're like slowly lined up. And I'm thinking like, dude, if my dad's a village was invaded a week earlier, then that's him. That's his grandfather, you know? And this guy's like slowly moving forward. These other Jews are like coming into and the first Jew was like, I was here first! They're so pushy! So, all right. By the way, you guys, I'm focusing on Judaism just because it's my religion. It's the one I know most about. You probably know most about that. But I'm just one religion in many religions, right? So what I'm hoping you guys do tonight in this whole weekend month and shit, go home and examine your own crazy shit from your own religion. Because I just don't know all your crazy shit. But I know you have crazy shit. Everybody does. I just know very little of what's that one kind of Christian that fucking drowns those people. And you're like, that's normal. Baptist, yeah, what the guys? That's not chill. I saw it in a movie at 21 years old. It's a fucking religious leader in a wet t-shirt contest in a creaky Kentucky. And then he's standing there up to his, and somebody rushes him. He's like, y'all blow! It's like Jesus. It's like, y'all. It's like, oh, I've just cheesed him. It's like, kill Bill, where he's like, who's gonna come at me? And then he just ups it. He's like, hand me a baby. And I'm like, what? No way. Turn this up. I know where he's going to hand this guy a baby. I'll always be like, my name is my name. I thought they were going to start throwing babies out on my fucking Trump in Puerto Rico with a towel. And he gets a baby, I don't know what he say, he was like, you know, whatever. But power of grace goes, oh, I got you. Oh, I got you. Hello, Majal. Yeah, so you guys got crazy here too. But none of what you got is as crazy as this thing. This comes from Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism. There's a book in there called The Zohar, which is the most out there mystical book there is. Like, it's out there. And they tell you not to study it, because it's about ghosts and the afterlife and shit like that. Most of Judaism is honestly just how to live your day-to-day life. Like how to love your wife. We do respect our wives. You just can't participate. But you got to respect your wife. How to love your wife. You know how to keep kosher. What happens if a goi ham's up her soup? You know, all that stuff. And The Zohar is like, why bother? And a drove men insane to study it. Like, so they say you're not supposed to study it to your 35 and married. But I saw it on a shelf in my eschiva in Jerusalem. And I was, you know, Jews are inquisitive. We're nosy on two fronts. And I was like, nobody's looking. I'm like, fuck it. I'm cracking it. I opened it up. I thought ghosts were going to fly out. Like one of those Harry Potter books. It's just a book. It's just a book. So I read it. And I read one passage before they found me and stopped me. And it was about masturbation. I got lucky. So you know how you're not supposed to masturbate in like every religion? There's not one religion. Like, no, go for it. It feels awesome. Why wouldn't you do it? Of course masturbate. Look how long I made your arm. I could have got any design. I went from scratch. I went exactly, thought I'm on top on both hands. Come on. No, don't touch it. Every religion is like, don't touch it. So in The Zohar, it says that when you are masturbating, when you do masturbate, what happens is, on the genomes to you, a demon woman comes into the room. You know, I know. And she rides you. She fucks you. You can't see her or feel her. So calm down in cells. And she rides you. And then when you calm, it goes into her and she gets pregnant. And then she, yeah, this is all real shit, dude. Well, whatever. I mean, none of this is real shit. But it's as real as Adam and Eve. And she rides you and she gets pregnant. And she goes off to this nether region. It's not heaven or hell or earth. It's just like this in between. Kind of like stranger things to the upside down. And she goes and has your baby. And the next time you masturbate, she comes back and she rides you again. Might be a month later. It's probably like 20 minutes later. And every single time you masturbate, the same demon lady rides you. And every single time she gets pregnant, she might be Latina. It's tough to say. They didn't really have that. They all test it. But at the science point, that's what they were saying. And all 13s, you're just whipping out these demon kids. Just kids, kids, kids, kids, kids, kids. So you're 20s, kids, kids, kids, these demon kids, you have. Oh, and it describes the kids. And they are fucked up. Yeah, not only because they grew up in a single parent household. Yeah, that can mess with any child. It's worse than that. They're mutants. Describes, they're half demon, half humans. They're all like the form. They got like one short leg, one short arm. Like 18 eyeballs going on their side. Oh, and they hate you. Yeah, because I guess somebody told them, if you just waited and fucked a regular human, they could have been a regular boy or girl. You couldn't wait. Could you generate pieces of shit? You saw an inside-out sock on the floor. And you're like, I'm gonna make a little demon baby right now. Yeah, by the way, none of this applies to women. You guys can drill off all you want. Scott Frey. Yeah. Enjoy your first taste of female privilege. But for the men, what we're producing is these fucking demon babies. Like, ah, I hate daddy. Somebody else like, what are you talking about, daddy? Like, yeah, I hate daddy. I hate him too. Ah, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like. And then two more pop up because you couldn't sleep on a Monday. Oh, what is this? Daddy did it. Ah, I hate him. Ah. All-theory-thirties, kids, kids, kids, kids. Your whole life just whipping out these demon babies till you're 90-something years old, you know. You're like, I ain't gonna masturbate when I came. I ain't gonna masturbate in your 15 years. My Parkinson's will help me with this. And then you get one drop. One drop doesn't matter, kid. And then you die. Ever write dies, right? At some point you die. You wake up and see afterlife. And then you're like, what's that, that's what I knew it. I knew it was an afterlife. Is that heaven? Can I get in? They're like, well, this is what they tell you. Like, you can come in. But before you do, you have to go meet your kids. Yeah, they make you meet them. And you'll be like, what kids? They don't have any kids. And they'll be like, you're so many kids. My favorite part of the job. Dude, it says here in college, you made 11 per week for four and a half years. So, it points to this house, the demon lady's house. You go over there and you knock on the door. The demon lady opens the door and you're like, hello? And she goes, oh, hello, me, sir. Oh, me, sir. Are you here at the meet your kids? Yeah, I guess so. She opens the door. And there's an army of them. You have no idea how many times you masturbated. It's so many. And they're all just walking around like walking dead. You know, it's everything. And then one of them finds, like, daddy? And they all look like, daddy's here. And they also come and ask you like, why, daddy? Why can't I be a real little boy, daddy? I want to live, daddy. We live, I can live, daddy! Yeah, it's a fucking horror movie. Very unsettling. Here's the cool part. That is negative. Here's the cool part. You don't have to take care of them. Yeah, you still got to go to heaven. Just for real ruins of vibe, that first week. You know, you meet your loved ones, your grandparents. Like, are you, like, I need a minute, guys. So anyway, let's take one last one that you guys, that we overlap a little bit, choosing Christians. And actually Muslims have this one too. Almost every religion has this. The flood, great flood. You know, you guys remember that one? Where God fucking killed everybody. He's way worse than COVID. He's COVID to 9-11th power. Fucking bad news, man. So now, at the end of the rain, God sends a sign to let us know that there will never be another great flood. Do you guys know what that sign is? The rainbow, yeah, you guys remember this. The rainbow. The rainbow is God's way of saying, hey, sorry about that one time. I overreacted for sure. You guys are wicked, but I went way too far. I'm sorry. So here's some pretty colors. Even Stevens. Yeah, now I don't know if you guys know what God's round everybody. They're wicked. The world's full of wicked people. But it was a specific kind of wicked. Does anybody know it? Saddamie is right. Saddamie is the answer. There's a few different discussions of it, but Saddamie is a big one. But fucking, if you don't know what Saddamie is, the world's full of butt fuckers. And God hates butt fuckers, everybody. Yeah, I do not. I have no problem with all butt fuckers. I have butt fucker friends. I voted for butt fucker rights in California. Yeah, it was not called that on the ballot. But it would have been less confusing. Yeah, I've been a butt fucker actually. Yeah, like 10 times. Nine times on purpose. One time, Doggy Style and Miss Happy. Yeah, I was like, this feels different. Yeah, does it feel different? I bet it does. Yeah, but I'm not God. God does not like genocide. But he hates butt fucking. You know, genocide is like, I'm not even getting involved. I'm kind of nudged here on that one. But okay, butt fucking is like, I'm going to do something about this. And back then, in Bible Times, there are whole cities devoted just to butt fucking. For what? The whole city is devoted just to butt fucking. For real. Sodom and Gomorrah. Have you ever heard of Sodom and Gomorrah? And what do you think they did a lot in the city of Sodom? They did Sodom, you guys. They did so much butt fucking. They named it after their town. That's how you know something is big in a place. What do you mean by that? Buffalo wings. We all know where those came from. You know, in Hamburg, Germany, there's these flat beef patties on a bun. They make delicious hamburger and flat beef patties. So everybody knows it from here. Yeah, hamburgers. And then two towns over in Cheeseburg, they put their own spin on it. I'm stupid as joke I've ever written in my life. I'm generally 20 years, I'm about fucking moron. In Sodom, they're just butt fucking all the time. Like, we're the best butt fuckers around. And they're like, what should we call this? Everybody knows we started that here. And somebody's like, how do we call it Sodom me? And he was like, yes. Sodom me. I'll butt fuck to that. Huh. Guys, we're not butt fucking. We're Sodom me. Oh, they excelled at butt fucking in Sodom. I don't know what they did in Gomorrah, but I guarantee you, who's some dark shit. Yeah, the last thing you want is to get Gomorrah. But here's today all the flood, the Great Flood. It's about a thousand years before Salah Mammurah. And back then, it wasn't one or two butt fuck towns. They were all butt fuck towns. And God hated it, man. It drove him crazy. He paced him down in his god house going, he's fucking butt fuckers. It's not what I want for the butt. The only fucker who pissed him blood comes out. And then Mrs. God was like, come to bed. There's no Mrs. God, by the way. I didn't make that up, but if there was, she'd be like, just tell them how you feel. You're so smart, baby. So he went to all the towns, right? He went to the whole world. He told them. Guys, could you please stop butt fucking? They were just not receptive at all. They were like, we'll never stop butt fucking. This is who we are. You're actually been culturally insensitive, to be honest. Get with the times, man. It's negative 8,000. A lot of people fucking butt fuck at this point. I think it's like, really? All you butt fuck, the gay man. We all butt fuck. Get over it. Oh, actually, it's not true. It's not true. It's not one guy up on the hill. Old Noah. Old vaginal only Noah. That's a recall. It's fucking nerd. He had her butt fucks. All he ever does is just raw dog in the pus. Oh, disgusting. Disgusting. They ridiculed Noah. They made a life of living hell. They really were really mean to him. They made a register as a sex offender. Can't be around our good butt fucking kids with that crazy, satanic raw dog in the push that you're pulling. So Noah lived by himself on the mountain with his pussy having wife. That's what God found of. And he goes, Noah is just like, Noah, is this true? That you just raw dog in the pus? And Noah is like, by the way, guys, I hope you understand. I'm paraphrasing a lot of this. I don't want any of my thing. There's a word for word translation tonight. The facts are all there. The linko is updated. I would say considerably. It was more like, it was more like, when is that? Oh, come on, come on, go on. You'd be like, you'd be like, uh, the Lord say it unto Noah. The dust I not tap the ass of I never heard of. But Noah's like, dude, I like the vagina. And God's like, is the vagina great? You nailed it with the vagina. It's your best invention by far. I hit it off, God don't know it. On the love of pussy. For real. That's all he talked about for like two weeks. You know that creepy guy in the bar? There's a god love pussy so much. You like, dude, fucking stop. I don't know you. That's God of Noah. That was a whole relationship. I traded pussy stories, a pussy secrets. At that point, God was like, hey Noah, you ever tried a wet vagina? And Noah was like, dude, wet vaginas are my favorite kind of vaginas. It slips right in. You just got to lick it a little bit. And God's like, uh, borderline behavior. Maybe don't ask, don't tell on that. I'm just a pretty gross. And then this is my favorite part of the story. This thing makes sense to me as a kid when I first heard it. I guess God goes, well Noah, on a kind of our experience, just raw dog into the pussy. Uh, you should be a zoologist. Then anyway, then you know what happens to start raining. And I always remember the story as God told Noah to keep it quiet. You know, keeping the DL so they don't feel boats or anything. But I remember it wrong. I had to go look it up. I was, I'm not tripped to Berlin. I also ended up going to Israel first time in like 25 years. And I was my oldest Shiva. And it's exactly the same. My old rap I was there. It's like late 80s now. Sort of a memorandum baby, but not really. He was like, what do you do now? I'm like, I'm a stand-up comedian. And he goes, that means nothing to me. All he wanted to know, he goes to you, he's still used to teaching. And I was like, actually, yeah, lately. Quite a lot. And he goes, do you want to learn something? I'm like, yes. So we went to the bait measures. We opened up this passage and we learned it. And it turned out God told Noah to warn everybody else. Because he loves his creatures, right? So he wanted to save him. Not all religions stupid. Like, it's a good lesson. Like, especially in this day and age, and everyone's like, you have views different than mine. Like, write them off. God would say, no, no, go talk to them and try to get them back. Just write them off. You know, so that Noah, he told to do that. I would love to have heard that conversation. You know, Noah, a good man going into the town. I was like, guys, I need to talk to you. And they're probably like, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay. Fuck off, dork. Oh, what are you going to talk to about? Who am I going to do? For China's. We're not interested. Sell it somewhere else, loser. I know, it's just like, why do you guys hate me so much? I'm like, because you're dick smells like pussy, faggot. Real dick smells like assholes, you fucking queer. What the fuck out of the town? I don't know what she's like, fuckin' whatever, fine.

But then it came raining more and more until they all drowned. All the butt fuckers. They all drowned. Even the two-year-olds. Enjoy church on Sunday. If you're going. It's what you're praying to. Child murder or God. So then with all the butt fuckers gone, God was like mission accomplished. Never have to do that again. So now we sense a sign to let us know. We'll never send another great flood. And that sign. That sign is the rainbow. The rainbow, the number one gay sign in the whole world. The rainbows on every gay flag across the globe. Every gay bar.

That's so dope when I went to college it was four dudes in a room like maybe from like here To here it was four dudes it was awful we would all wake up with boners and look at each other And we would be like this isn't what I thought college would be Everybody has to shit nobody wants to go first Fucking hated that I hated my roommates I remember one of them found out he had the biggest dick in the dorm And then all of a sudden he was making all the decisions all of a sudden It was like I think we're gonna go bowling tonight and I was like all right big dick Brian yeah whatever Yeah I used to jerk off when they were there fuck them I don't give a shit Yeah fuck them I won every night they had no idea sick I was jerking off when they were fucking typing awesome I did it at night I didn't do it during the day I'm not a savage Yeah I wasn't like four o'clock like hey what's up bro? Ready for study hall like it was like at night No I like to help people this is how you jerk off if you're sharing a room with somebody Very simple you get a very big bag of Doritos doesn't have to be Doritos I just always go with Doritos Get a big bag of chips okay and then you start crinkling it around we get non jerking off hand right creating some sort of an ambiance And then while you're doing that you jerk off Yeah they cancel each other out my room was just thought I had a snack every night They're like pete each Doritos every night for like a half hour doesn't share with anybody And then when he's done eating he goes oh fuck fuck oh fuck yes So first day at college I had this class and there was a mentally challenged kid in it And I have no problem with mentally challenged kids that would be very weird if I did Like if that was my beef If I was like peace and love and fuck mentally challenged kids wait what's up with this guy The problem I had was I was also in that class Yeah so like one thing came to my mind when I saw the kid I was first like oh and I was like oh What is that? I was like am I mentally challenged like is this Is this how they're going to tell me they're just going to throw me in hope I figure it out No I wouldn't be surprised I was like maybe I'm like one of the better ones or something Maybe I'm their leader I had no idea By the way I see a lot of people getting sensitive because mentally challenged people are very sensitive to top people I understand completely but to make you feel better I have a mentally challenged cousin And I asked her if I could do these jokes and she was like so it's completely funny She's very supportive loves me okay She wasn't like oh she was like I know the difference it went up I remember I had a sit behind this mentally challenged kid You know because we were in alphabetical order just so happened we had the same close last name I got to sit behind him And I was like this is like karma this is what I get for cheating on every test in high school God's like cheat now have fun drawing dragons on your test I never get this is a true story I'm like not that good at comedy this is like a real thing that happened I'll tell you we had movie day in college I'll tell you yeah teacher wheeled in a cart and was like it's movie day and I was like sick And I was like wait it's college why I never got this the teacher picked far as gum okay It's a true story and I'll never forget this before he starts the movie he goes all right class who here so far as gum I swear to God the mentally challenged kid just goes I did sir and that's my favorite movie and I laughed so fucking hard I laughed so hard and then I looked around nobody else was laughing Even the mentally challenged kid was like are you fucking serious right now it's a nice dragon Been trying to smoke less weed If you were in this front row of shorts you know it's not working out very well I don't want to quit I'm not like a pussy I just want to smoke like at night I just like to not be high all the time it's hard but I feel like you know I can figure it out eventually It's not good like when you don't smoke weed for a little bit like it's crazy like you have feelings You know like something will happen and I'll be like hey I don't I don't like that As opposed to like seven years of just being like it is what it is Swag or whatever I think I smoke weed subconsciously like I don't even know I'm doing it I'm serious Like I think I smoke weed so like if I fail in my head I'll be like well I was high so what did you expect? You know what I mean but if I accomplish something I'll be like and I was fucking high Woo! So it's like this I always win in my head This Christmas I had a couple weeks off I tried to go to rehab for my mom as a Christmas gift But it's weird I tried to go to rehab because I wanted to smoke weed less like I didn't even want to quit Don't tell anybody that in rehab by the way So I didn't have enough time to think about it I was like I'll go to rehab so I asked my friends I you know people who know about this stuff and I was like where should we go? What's like the best place they were like you should go to a rehab facility in Utah Without even thinking book the flight Did you know when you book a flight to Utah there is a layover in Denver And I was sitting in the airport like is this part of the fucking rehab like do I is this level one? Do I have to get past this? Also did you know that there's rehabs everywhere you don't have to go to Utah? I found that out because I got there and I was like hi my name is Pete Davidson They're like oh wait you're from I was like I live in Manhattan and like oh have you heard about our facilities in Manhattan? I was like no I heard about the one in Utah So weird thing going to rehab when you want to smoke weed less like not even quit Because people are there for crack and meth and I'm there because like I want to know what food tastes like That's what happens by the way when you stop smoking weed for a little bit You're like oh some food isn't that good? First thing you do when you get into a rehab is you check into detox I didn't know there was no such thing as detox for potheads So I should have known something was up because I was in a line waiting to check in And everybody in front of me was shaking and I wasn't And I felt uncomfortable it's like fuck that I'm not gonna be the odd man out In rehab so I started shaking myself I was like oh I kicked in later you guys fuck holy shit I remember this guy was just like hey guys I'm Joe I do crack I died And then he was like but they brought me back Ha ha obviously and I was like ha ha ha ha I don't know if that's funny And he was just like this is my last shot everybody was like thank you thank you Joe And I didn't know you thanked him after so I was late I was like oh thanks Joe And then everybody looked at me and I was like They had all these weird rules very very weird rules like they were like I wanted to watch crank 2 the guy there was a bunch of people in the rehab I was like yeah you ever see crank and the guy was like oh yeah it's one of my fears I was like ever see crank 2 he's like no I was like how long have you been in here And I like in order to watch crank 2 you have to fill out a form like if you want to watch something I was like crank 2 And they were like no you can't watch crank 2 Because this drugs in it this sex in it this violence in it you know What if someone watches it and then it makes gives them the urge to go do that again and it ruins their their program I was like that makes no fucking sense that would never like if that's the reason why you're gonna withdraw like you shouldn't be in rehab anyway That's just how I feel like I doubt I'm ever gonna be in a rehab meeting ever again And someone's like hey my name's Max so it's my second time back crank 2 I love smoking weed I'm probably never gonna stop to be honest with you Yeah and I'm not doing it for an applause that's just I have problems I need it and it makes me feel better So I got like I love smoke I love smoke weed and driving it's my favorite Yeah I love being high when I'm driving I'm like I don't mind traffic I'm like oh company Alright I'm like we're all in this together you guys You ever make friends in traffic that's the fucking best pull up to a stop go to the guy next to you like The guy next to you is like I love smoke weed I don't think I would have any friends fight and so smoke when we I wouldn't I wouldn't have any friends I've been friends with my friends for seven years I don't know anything about them when we got along very well Just been like seven years like and that's it You hear that new song yeah it's dope our whole friendship it's fucking amazing I love smoking weed to watch your movies it's my favorite You ever get so high you like watch the credits And you're like who directed this he did a good job I think that's what IMDB was created for people just get high and they're like where is this guy from? And then you're like oh there he is he was in the Patriot One of my favorite movies to watch high is Jaws Jaws is one of my favorite movies because it was made in the 70s So when I watch it it looks like a movie Does that make sense it probably does it but when I watch a movie now I'm like oh that could happen But because it's in the 70s I could tell I'll give you a couple examples like I love the way they talk in Jaws They talk very differently like this is seen where Richard Dreyfus wants to ask the mayor if he can cut open the shark to see if that little Kittner boys in there I'm glad you left because it always makes me laugh No I'm serious it always makes me laugh. I think it's just a visual of like what if the little boy was actually in there You know like what if he like cuts it open and all of a sudden the boys like He's like he was in that chief That would be hilarious I just like the way they talk in Jaws There's a scene Richard Dreyfus wants to ask the mayor if he can cut open the shark and he's like hey could I cut open the shark see if Little Kittner boys in there and the mayor goes I'll be damned if you cut open that shark and I see that little Kittner boys Spill out all over the dock and I'm like that's fucking sick Nobody talks like that anymore if that scene was made today that whole scene would be like hey can I cut open the shark? You're like nah fucking do it later Don't want to get the dock dirty and shit Also, I was watching Jaws I found out a scene that doesn't actually belong in there. It's not proven I just watched it and I was like I felt Here's the scene so Richard Dreyfus finally is cutting open the shark And this fat guy comes out of nowhere and he's just like hey Hey What type of shark is that? And Richard Dreyfus goes it's a tiger shark and then the fat guy goes what? That scene shouldn't be in the fucking movie It makes no sense. I was like what is that Spielberg's uncle? What is that? It's probably his uncle He's like Steve A you're gonna put me in your movie? He's like yeah, can you say a what? He's like can I fucking say a what? Come on Another movie I watched high I actually really like I watched the vowel recently I Love the vowel If you don't know what the vowel is it's a chanting Tatum and Rachel McAdams and they're married and in the first scene They get in a car accident and luckily she goes through the windshield and Oh, yes, my favorite part and it's in slow motion so you get to enjoy it No, fuck that it's always the guy going to the windshield and I was like oh it's a girl. I said I'm Nicholas barks. I see you I'm invested She goes through the windshield she ends up losing her memory. She doesn't remember that she's married The movie should have been over right there. That's it Should have been a short film about some bitch. You should have wore a seat belt. That's all I needed to be Instead of that the rest of this movie this poor guy Trying to make his wife fall back in love with him because she don't remember him That would never happen I mean maybe a wood but I tried to put myself like in that situation wherever I watch the movie and I wouldn't be able to do it If I'm being completely honest like if I get married to you and you become a vegetable like you're a vegetable now And I'm on the run Because I'm not a vegetable That was me honestly and I walked into my wife's room and I walked in the hospital I go to my wife's room and I was like oh my god honey are you okay? And she's like who are you? I'd be like oh wrong room my bad Sorry to bother you man I would call on my friends me Guess who don't remember I tried I said hello I've been thinking about what I want to do with my life Trying to figure it out First thing is to find a pair of pants to fit Like I have a belt on and they still fit Like that's ridiculous No, I started wearing skinny jeans because I heard it ruined your come when I was like sick bring them on Yeah Big supporter of skinny jeans They ruined your balls It's great brand that should be the commercial should be like two people fucking coming inside and then I'm just putting on skinny jeans No bag no problem. I was wearing skinny's I Figure out what I wanted to do I want to do commercials I Want to be a spokesperson I don't want to do movies. I don't want to stand up anymore I really just want to be like a commercial guy Like an AT&T guy they're like hey you need a fucking phone like I'll be that guy forever No problem. Hey, you need a fucking phone But I'm talking to my friend some people hate spokespeople Some people do not like spokespeople at all You know like whenever I'm watching TV and my friends over my house And if I'm watching TV and and flow the progressive lady comes on Immediately the person I'm with is like, oh this fucking bitch. I'm like why I mean I agree But like why why do we hate her so much? My friend was like that what you want to be you want to be flow as like I'm sure she has friends like I'm sure So she's not alone on the weekends And I was like look at Jared.

What if some I Been uh, I watched a lot of porn like I could post the throwback Thursday photo of me jerking off and um Like I do I watch a lot of porn and I noticed something. I don't know if you're an avid porn user But online there's no new porn unless you pay for it So I've been watching some of the classics No problem I could watch some classics Yeah But I noticed something that I don't like in porn because I've been watching the same porn's over and over I'm noticing new things You know like this is something I really don't like I don't like when male porn stars moan Yeah, what the fuck's up with that? It's like you're a professional act like you've been there before Yeah And you know as a male porn star like guys are jerking off to this so why would you moan so loud? You know how distracting that is Have some fucking respect for your fans seriously Oh, I was watching this porn the other day and I was like oh yeah fuck Fuck yeah, and I was like what a fucking weirdo. I'm like you shut the fuck up so I can fucking come please you fucking weirdo I Don't make any noise when I have sex zero gentlemen Nothing please. Thank you the whole way through I don't even make noise when I come when I calm I'm just kind of like Yeah, like I just had an epiphany or something like oh my keys they're my jeans like that's how I come Don't forget to turn the oven off. That's how I literally come You If I'm drunk I'll yell out one thing when I come I'll tell you what it is Okay This is one thing I'll yell out when I'm drunk when I come this is the one thing Okay, I don't know if any of you are familiar with the film 101 Dalmatians You There is a scene In 101 Dalmatians when Jeff Daniels this puppy gives birth Okay, and this lady take care of the puppies She's like there's 14 puppies One of them died there's supposed to be 15 but there's 14 And Jeff Daniels being the goddamn genius of an actor that he is Out of the corner of his eye notices the 15 puppy that they thought was dead is starting to wiggle. So it's alive And he looks at the lady and he goes no Not 14 15 15 puppies So I yell out when I come now Which is a huge step up from sorry So Anybody here have a do shrooms Like I'm afraid to do drugs because I love them Like whenever I'm about to do a drug I need to do it with a friend that way like if I die he dies too For some reason that would be so much better for my mom to find out Like if two of us died it's not as bad as just me. Does that make sense? No, I'm serious because if I just died my mom's like what a fucking drug addict But if it's me another friend I'd be like that bad influence Ryan Always said he was no good for my son I pick my friend Ryan to do shrooms with me my friend Ryan some of you might know some of you might not He's just six foot five two hundred fifty pound black dude from flat bush Brooklyn Okay, he's been a jail bunch of times for real shit not for like hopping a turn style like murder Okay, he didn't do it and Yeah He's nice to me So I before I do a drug I usually google the best and worst thing that could happen I Probably not a good idea But again, I'm not a smart person. Let me tell you how not smart I am okay This is how not smart of a person I am I thought Chicago was a state until a week ago Not done only reason why I found out Chicago is not a state is because I was in Chicago doing a show came out Said wonderful to be in the state of Chicago Nobody said anything Nobody said anything till the end of the show so I did a whole show with state of Chicago confidence That's how fucking stupid I am So I looked up I was like what's the best thing that could happen to you on shrooms best review I saw was I did shrooms I saw the world and I feel like I'm a better person now and I was like That's a great review 200 likes nice reliable Worst review of shrooms don't do them jumped out of my window 500 likes I was like fuck I have two windows so there's double either chance So I got Ryan in my apartment and I got a guy a man to come over to install shrooms Child locks on my windows And he got to my house and he's putting in the child box and he's like oh my god This is so sweet. What's the baby do and I was like there's no baby me and him are doing shrooms So we do shrooms and then nothing happens for about an hour And you know when people do drugs or drink and they and they just brag about how not fucked up they are And it's the most annoying thing ever To me it really bothers me whenever someone's like drank 14 beers. I don't feel shit And it's like oh, maybe you're autistic then because you should be fucked up completely to be honest with you So we were getting a little mad that it wasn't working so we turned on this movie With Al Pacino and Christopher walkin. It's a new movie. So just know They already look scary I'm on my phone for like 20 minutes just scrolling and you know how when you scroll and it look the little loading bar comes up So the next page can come up there was no loading bar. There was just pages coming up So I was just like oh wow my wife I is sick like I was very into my wife I was like net gear 32 kill it right now fucking flying through everything no loading bar It's very excited Ryan goes yo Is Al Pacino orange And I'm scrolling and I looked up and he was but it didn't bother me I went back on my phone. I was like yeah, he is really bothered Ryan because now Ryan was hiding under a snuggie shaking And he said yo bro call me when this is over So I was freaking out. I was like already the safest guy that I picked to do shrooms with is already hiding under my snuggie Fucked I sort of panicking and freaking out. I can't do this alone, you know I can't do anything alone So I told Ryan I was like listen I'm gonna go downstairs tell the door man. We're very high on shrooms in case anything happens To which Ryan goes why the fuck would you do that? And I said so he knows I It makes no sense but at the time it made so much sense to me He's like why would you do that? I said why the fuck would he do that so he knows Guy with the questions So then I got in the elevator it went down one floor and it stopped the alarm went off And I was freaking out. I was like fuck I'm fucked. I need to get out of here So I started punching the elevator trying to open it. I was freaking out. I was staring at my fist I was like if it ever would happen it would happen now Wolverine come on one time Wolverine one time didn't happen obviously. I wouldn't be here right now I got downstairs Okay elevated doors open. I was too afraid to get out because I was afraid I want to go back up Makes no sense but at the time huge fucking problem Like I was like what if it don't go back up So I just stuck my head out to the door man. I was like hey, it's Pete Third floor if anything happens me and my friend Ryan will really high on shrooms And he looked at it like this and then the door just fucking closed His face I got back upstairs into my apartment two windows open no Ryan So So what I said I fucking knew it. I knew this would happen 500 people liked it And then Ryan goes yo my bad about the windows. I'm in the bathroom I was like all right Okay Now normally I don't care what my friends are in the bathroom for over an hour And I don't ask what's going on in there But we were both on shrooms and it was over an hour So I was like hey Ryan what the fuck's going on in there and it was like bro you gotta get in here Ryan's been a jail So I was like is this jail Ryan Or is this my friend Ryan that we all know and love I Get in there. This is a true. This is exactly what's going. He's naked in his boxers flexing Having the fucking time of his life just flexing. He's like, uh, yeah, uh-huh. Yeah Yeah I'm like, what's up bro? Like what's going on? And he's like I'm the Hulk And I didn't know what he was talking about. I was like what do you mean you're the Hulk? He goes don't you see? I'm green I'm the very first black Hulk And he kept flexing and I was like I don't I don't get it. He was like look in the mirror This is the only time that I tripped. I looked at Ryan like this looked at him into the mirror He turned green into the mirror and I was like oh my god you are the Hulk congratulations. This is sick So then I got a little cocky and I was like perhaps I'm also the Hulk And I took my shirt off and I just looked very sick. I was like I need to get out of here I Ryan gets on the couch or watching we're about to watch the rest of this movie the second we hit play It's a scene where Al Pacino comes out from behind the corner and goes hello And we were like fuck that. That's the scariest thing I've ever seen about life. So we shut it off It's horrifying seeing a 75 year old orange person go hello was fucking terrifying So Now me and Ryan are both high on shrooms shirtless under our snuggie just shaking holding each other And then my mom text me okay my mom sends the worst possible text you could send when someone's violently high on shrooms She sends me a peat just wanna let you know. I'm so proud of you I love everything you're doing you make such smart decisions and dad would be very proud And then I just started crying I was like oh man my mom's all proud I'm on shrooms I wasn't even the Hulk like it was just this whole fucked up a bad day And then Ryan goes shut the fuck up And you know when you're crying and your friend don't care it makes you cry more When you're like uh and your friends like uh and you're like like Please care So maybe cry more I was like what do you mean like who does that means like bro seriously shut the fuck off I'm gonna punch you in the face I was like why can't you just be my friend why can't you just be there for me and he's like Because I miss my mom too and then he started crying and then we both held each other and cried Under my snuggie and then the shroom trip was over and then Ryan did the funniest thing I've ever seen anybody do Um he took the snuggie off and he dabbed his eyes with it And then he looked at many one He'll pee shrooms Incredible Thank you thank you very much So We'll do some 9-11 jokes and we'll get the fuck out of here. How's that sound It's hard to transition into anything. I don't have I don't know if you noticed anything about my comedy But this it's not many transitions It's very like dick fuck dead like it's like very straightforward easy listening comedy Like you know, it's not the Kendrick Lamont. I'm very French Montana of comedy Like after every joke I should just be like So Yeah, my dad if you don't know he was a fireman. He died 9-11. He was very good dude Uh, and I have a lot of jokes about it and if you don't like the first one you probably won't like the rest What's cool about your dad dying on 9-11? Is The free parking is also oh for one scurball That's not the only good thing about your dad dying come on Now the cool thing about my dad dying and being a fireman was like now I get all this fireman gear So whenever I smoke weed in New York City I wear it Yeah, so now people just think I'm a shitty fireman But I'll be so high I'll forget when people come on to me and be like you're a fucking disgrace and I'm like you're a fucking disgrace I'm like oh shit, I'm a lieutenant. I forgot I'm very sorry have a good day ma'am I Didn't really care what my dad died it didn't bother me very much because I was seven you don't understand things when you're seven You know if it if it happened now I'd be in a world of trouble, but I'm actually it's weird to say this I'm a lucky it happened when I was seven. I know that sounds weird, but it's a it's the real thing Like I remember my dad died and my mom was like your dad's dead, but we got you a PlayStation 2 and I was like yeah cool I was like that seems about even That's pretty fair Oh, I'm serious. I really didn't care. I was like I'm gonna push my mom down the stairs and get a ps3. I was fucking ridiculous It's my new life of murder and toys What's weird is my grandma on my mom's side my mom's mom she uh her birthday's on 9-11 and she never liked my dad Oh Kind of fishy isn't it I always wanted to ask her I always wanted to be like hey grandma On the low Did you make any wishes No No, every year my grandma's birthday comes around and she's like I'm not gonna celebrate. I'm always like why It's something happened I want to get a tattoo. Uh, I want to get my dad's initials um It's a very like Italian statin island thing to do I feel like Italian people are almost like waiting for someone in their family to die So they can go get a tattoo I'm serious. You haven't been to like an Italian funeral awake and the son of whoever died as like the prayer card going down their side You know how the fuck did you do that already and it's like healed I um I want to get my dad's initials, you know I want to get a tattooed on me. I feel like it'll be very cool Uh, but I found out recently. I can't I don't know why I never noticed it. I guess I just never pay attention But my dad's initials are smd Yeah That's why we named the special smd But smd also has other meanings like for instance suck my dick That's the more popular meaning Believe it or not So my friends are like you can't get that tattoo because people will think you're an asshole You know and I agree. I'm like you're right. I shouldn't But then I thought about it. I was like I should I was like I could only win I was like if someone has the balls to bring it up to me Oh, I will win like so fast Like I will never lose. It's so dope think about that. I'll have it on my neck Fucking having a good time girls come up to me and they're like you're a fucking pig. All I gotta do is be like Actually, it's my dad's initials and they'll feel so bad. They'll probably suck my dick Hey guys, you've been amazing. Thank you Thank you for coming out. Thank you very much Oh Tego's Singah's come back here, come back here, come back here. Come back with my phone.
This is the last party festival. Kevin Hart presents KELOLAND CHIABAND. I'm the divorced father of teenage boys. That's who the hell I am, man. Let me tell you something. The worst thing about fatherhood of boys is waking the asses up, man. If y'all ever tried to wake a teenage boy up, it's epic. This game of thrones like, man, lives is on the line. They just stayed dead. They don't swim. They don't sleep. They comb. You understand me? It's like they cryogenically frozen in the science fiction movie. It's like they're traveling through space. It's like aliens too waking them up, man. I got to say, I got to literally set my youngest son on fire to wake his ass up. And I'm known as like, it's four ways people wake up in life. It's four ways people wake up. These are the four wake up stages. You got the coma wake up, which is my youngest son, where they just, people just look at you with dead eyes. Like, they're looking through you. You wake them up. They're like, are you up? How many fingers am I holding the head? I don't know where he is. That's one way. Another way is the panic wake up. Okay. When you wake them up, they always panic down. Like a lot of women wake up like this. When you wake them up, oh, Lord, is everybody okay? How the kids doing? Lord Jesus, what's going on? How the kids are? How the kids are? How the kids are? How the kids are? How the kids are? How the kids are? How the kids are? How the kids are? How the kids are? How the kids are? Lord Jesus, what's going on? How the kids are? Okay, what kids are you talking about? You don't even have kids. What were you dreaming about last night? Oh, Lord, the kids. The ship turned over. Like, what were you dreaming about? The third way is the cranky wake up. A lot of people wake up like that. Like, they hate you and life when you wake them up. Even though they asked you to wake them up, they still cuss you out for waking them up. And they ask you. It's so sweet when they ask you. Like, listen, I got to get up at 8. I cannot over sleep. Please, if you could just find it in your heart and soul, the humbly wake me up. Please, I'm begging you. Thank you. Can you do that? Oh, praise God for your soul. Thank you so much. Humbly though. They go to bed. You happen to wake them up like, oh, that was so sweet. You wake them up like, what the fuck you want, man? You told me to wake them up like, what the fuck I said? Make it out of here, man. Then they go sit on the bed for 10 minutes. Like, yeah, get out of my room, man. Yeah. And then you got the denial sleep. That's me. That's the eye fault of sleep. Like, when you wake me up, I'm the person that acts like I was never sleep. I try to dive into a conversation that wasn't even happening. Like, you wake me up, yeah, yeah, cause they don't have those taxes overseas. The taxes are different. What you talking about, Tony? Yeah, I agree, man. Cause some of the time it's my life. I was like, what's wrong with you? You know, I'm on the phone. I don't know. I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone. Cause some of the time it's my least favorite season as well. You wake me up. Oh, McDonald's actually has the best fries in the fast food chain. You all year, wouldn't talk about that. Excuse me. Like I said, man, I got boys, man. And I'm single. But I'm technically not single. Cause my son has a girlfriend. So I'm paying for his dates. So it's like I'm dating. I'm basically the executive producer of his relationship. That's what the fuck I'm doing. You know what I'm saying? I'm the executive producer of my son's relationship. I just hate all my kids too, man. They just got it made all around, man. Like I was watching my kids eat cereal other day, eating breakfast while watching Netflix at the same time. Let me tell you something. I grew up in the 80s. That wasn't an option for me. Okay. We couldn't even go in the living room to watch TV while we ate. We had to eat first, then watch TV. Cause we only had one TV downstairs, okay? And you damn show what needn't in the living room. So we just had to sit there and eat, and we had nothing. You know what the best show on TV was for breakfast? The back of the cereal box, season one. The back of the goddamn cereal box was my Netflix. You be eating your cereal, you turn that box over, you be like, okay, all right. You read that whole thing. You read that whole box from top to bottom. Just, okay, okay. If it was amazing on there, you did the maze, you was like, okay. And if you was a two bowls of cereal cat like myself, I would do the maze backwards on the second bowl. Look, I almost switched it up on this one. Okay. Best show on TV back then, man. I'm a foodie for real too, man. I love food, food is life. Food is life. Food is my vice. People ask me what's your vibe, because I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't gamble, I don't do prostitutes, I don't do happy ending massages. People are like, what's your vibe? Because people don't trust you until you show what the vice is, okay. I'm like, food is my vice, I better respect food, because food is killing people by the millions out here. Poor dies respect my vice out here. Food is my joint, man. Food is better than sex to me, man. Because I'm single. I don't know when I'm having sex again, but I know for a fact, I'm eating again tonight. Guaranteed. Guaranteed, raw, unprotected eating too. I'm gonna probably eat with strangers tonight. That's how risky it is out here, man. Food is better than sex. If y'all don't agree with me, food is better than sex, man. You can talk about food with anybody. Anybody, strangers, kids, whatever. You can't talk about sex with anybody. Like, I can run up to a stranger on the street and be like, who got the better piece of New York and Chicago? Go. And we'll be talking for 15 minutes, arguing with them. I can't run up on you. All right, man, what's your, the dog and style of mission there? Which one's better? Oh, you slapping me out here? This is crazy. Food brings people together. Sex tells people apart. It ruins families, friendships. Fellas, how many times have you heard this from a woman? I don't want it ruined in the friendship. First of all, ladies, let me tell you something. We don't give a damn about the friendship, all right? We'll take that chance. If we lose you as a friend, all right. All right, all right. That's too bad. We wouldn't even friends that long. Man, we friendship, but you're talking about. Food has a holiday. Sex doesn't. Thanks, given. Food. You can pay day off to eat. You can't take the day off with sex. You come in the next day, you getting fired. Hey, where was you at Thursday? Oh, man, I was having sex, man. It was sex day. You fired. Food is better than sex, man. You can swap recipes with your grandmother. You can't swap sex moves with your grandmother? That's disgusting. Can't call your nana up. Nana, what was that move you used to put on granddad? Oh, that was the back with swivel kick, baby. He climbed max every time we tried it. I was like, what's wrong with you? I was like, what's wrong with you? I was like, what's wrong with you? I was like, what's wrong with you? I was like, what's wrong with you? I was like, what's wrong with you? It's normal to have sex every time we tried it. Call me, and let me know it would work for you all. I'll be in myiedzieć, man. That's disgusting.
And sometime we'll show you the joy, love of Classifications, and all that accident happens We can't just come into freinds anymore說 and then cut it. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you. Oh! Thank you very much, Minneapolis. I am going to say some things tonight that by the end of the show are probably going to offend everybody here. Woo! Woo! I want you to remember that. If you find yourself starting to get tense, so I want you to just keep two things in mind to make the pills easier to swallow. The first thing is, really, at the end of the day, who the fuck am I? I'm just some random dickhead who admittedly doesn't have all the answers. Trying to figure things out as I go. I'm a curious person, I try to evolve, so my opinions change over time. So there's a good chance that a couple months from now, or maybe even a couple hours from now. I'm not going to like some of the things I say tonight. And the second arguably more important thing to keep in mind is, who the fuck are you? No matter who you think you might be, I assure you you're also just some random dickhead. Who doesn't have all the answers, trying to figure shit out as you go. And I think if we could all keep that in mind more often, we could be less triggered as society and calm the fuck down and deal with each other with a little more humility and grace. We're all just trying to figure things out. Or maybe it's too late for that. But the best way to make society a little more tolerable for those of us who remain will be to give every American a one-question quiz. Do you actually believe that a secret, satanic cabal, is controlling society from the shadows? And anybody who answers, yes, you know, we kill him. You sacrifice him to Satan and we start over. I'm just bit bummed, I don't know. Weird times are living in very conspiratorial times. I never thought I would get this bad. This is how off I was. When I recorded my last special, I had a couple conspiracy bits on there, making fun of flat-earthers and people who were worried about the lizard illuminati. And I remember being worried that if we didn't hurry up and edit that special quickly and release it fast by the time it came out, conspiracy jokes would no longer be culturally relevant. And then Q and I was like, get the fuck out of here! Hold on to your apocalypse horses. We're just getting warmed up, my friend. Didn't you hear the new one? Jesus just sent in Trump to save us from the devil. Jesus did that? Did grabbing by the pussy guy? That's who Jesus is. To have gone to the shoulder was like, get in there Donnie and fuck up those liberals. You can only hope. Interesting twist. My favorite conspiracy is from the last couple of years, are the ones that revolve around Bill Gates. A lot of Bill Gates concerned. A lot of people worried. Like after the COVID vaccine came out, there was a contingent of people online who were like, do not take that fake vaccine. Bill Gates made that. One of my first thoughts was, that's impressive for a computer program. Like I always knew he was smart, but got down. And interesting move for him to take his hands off the wheel of running a multi-billion dollar international conglomerate for a couple of days or whatever to head down to his laboratory and tinker with his evil beakers. Cook up some poison. They're like, yeah, don't take this vaccine. It's not real. It's poison. It's part of an agenda 21 depopulation program designed to kill millions of people. When I first heard that, I immediately thought this can't be real. Because that is simply too good to be true. That's a dream. I would love to put Bill Gates in charge with mass extermination event. He's a smart guy. I feel like he's getting rid of the right people. I think we should encourage him online to start a hashtag movement. Just let Bill kill. Release the Kraken. I just think of bills in charge. We're not going to be losing anybody important. We're not going to be losing business leaders and professors and doctors. We're going to be losing people who live in that sweet spot where Holocaust denial meets meth. We don't need those people. Robots are about to take their jobs. I think we should have a new Holocaust. Hear me out. A different one. A fun one. We're only going to kill Holocaust deniers. When they're all dead, we're going to act like it never happened. Hey. Finally, a Holocaust. We'll go about. There are a lot of conspiracies. A lot of conspiracies around the vaccine. I don't believe all of them. I make fun of a lot of conspiracies. I love some of the vaccine related ones. I don't think they should be mandated. There's a reason to be skeptical. Some people think that's crazy. Seriously? You don't think we can blindly and implicitly trust Big Pharma? What would they stand to gain from lying to us? I don't know hundreds of billions of dollars of corporate profits? When have they ever done something like, I don't know, collude with the FDA and intentionally manipulate data to do the exact thing you're talking about? I don't know. The opioid crisis. Shut the fuck up, conspiracy freak. That was a couple days ago. They're different now. We can trust them. I don't think we should trust them. There's a reason to be skeptical. That being said, most of the people I know who have chosen not to get the vaccine while there are good reasons not to do so, they have not employed those reasons. They've tended to fall in one of two camps. My observance. There's the live for your die. Don't try to make camp. Or the, I've never cared about my health before, a day in my life. But now, I'm a nutritionist camp. The live for your die argument is pretty simple. It's just, I don't want the government telling me how to live my life. And I appreciate the sentiment. But I do want the government kind of telling us how to live our lives. To some degree, because if they don't tell us how to live our lives at all, that's anarchy. An anarchy is for fucking psychopaths. Might sound fun as a fantasy, not in real life. Anarchy would only kind of work for young, fit dudes with no kids to worry about. Living in an easily defendable compound, who are very proficient with weapons, have a large supply of ammunition, ton of dry goods, tons of access to clean water. And even those guys after a few weeks are going to be like, this is fucking crazy! We should have police or hospitals or something. I just saw a bunch of guys I used to play softball with, and now there's some kind of, they're in a barbecue rape gang. I don't even know what that is. But that's what their flag set. It'd be real dystopian, real quick. Now we gotta have some rules. Rules is how you have a society. It's how you have civilization and nice things. It's the social contract. The bad part of the social contract is that we too often have to follow the illogical and manipulative laws passed by self-centered, ego-miniacal, just dipshit to care more about election cycle optics than to do about the average person. And that sucks because those people are cunts. That's not the fun part of the social contract. The fun part is to no longer have to live in caves and shit on rocks, and hunt deer with sharp sticks, and always worry about a larger biped coming over and taking our food and fucking our partner and or us. And I think the pros outweigh the cons overall. And whether or not you've taken a vaccine, I don't know how more or less free it makes you. You know, whether you took it or not, you're still a follower. Everybody in this room is a follower. If you weren't, you would have died long time ago, probably in a car wreck. You can suck my dickstop sign. I stop when I want. No one bosses me. Just blowing through intersections all willy-nilly, like some misguided William Wallace. The lights always green when you're fused to kneel. Freedom! Nah, that's crazy talk. The nutrition argument is my favorite one though. I'm not going to put something in my body, but I don't understand. When I've heard some version of that, I just think, I think I have a gas station hot dogs if you have. It's like, shut the fuck up. There's nothing more American than putting shit in your body you don't understand. We're a nation of consumerism and processed food. That's what we do. You know how much fruits and fruit loops? Not a drop. Put down the hatchet goes because cancer never takes it so good. I love to put things in my body. I don't fully understand. What is that? Probably Molly? You look trustworthy. My body's a temple and your god is Ronald McDonald. I never cared about your health. I hate now that jokes like those get politicized oftentimes. I buy certain segments of society, very lazy binary thinkers. You have an opinion on one subject that might read political and they think they know you. They want to put you all the way in the left or all the way in the right. There's no other option and just fill in the blanks and what you may believe elsewhere. I just, oh, okay. So you think there's some validity to science, huh? Looks like you want us to follow some laws. All right, boot liquor. I bet you want to take our guns too. Don't you? You call me piece of shit. What are you talking about? I didn't say any of that. Actually, I'm a gun owner. I like to go do a little target practice. If I'm going to be honest, sometimes I do like to pretend that the targets are people I don't care for like yourself. Relaxes me. Oh, so that's you are going to have your pew-pews feel like a big man. Home of phobic right wing nut job. Home of what? Because I like guns. I don't like the gaze that's insane. Now, I'm very pro LGBTQIA+. I think, you know, people should be able to love. Whoever they want to love. But don't fuck kids. Love adults. Whoever they want to love. That's all good. Oh, so that's you are. Liber legend. And no rules for anyone. You and Tifa motherfucker. What? No, I like some rules. I'm pro law enforcement, pro military. Yeah. What the fuck are you? You're not playing the game right. You have to be Fox or CNN. That's it. Now, you can hate both those options and I do. I just not a big fan of the Republicans or the Democrats right now. Fun will be completely honest. I don't feel like either side represents me. I feel like a lot of people think that. For me, you know, like with the left, there's just too much concern about the most easily outraged members of society. Right? You can take anything too far including empathy. I don't want to, you know, just marginalize anybody. I also don't want to walk on egg shells in this weird tense, puckered up society where everyone's worried about saying the wrong thing. Because that's a great way to suck the fucking joy out of life for everyone. And on the right, there's just too much religious thinking for me. Don't like religion and politics. Never will. For one very simple reason. Right? For me, the reason is no one can ever agree on what SkyDaddy wants. It's just all over the place. That's the problem. Like just with Christianity, there's over 45,000 different denominations of just this one religion in the world today. Over 45,000 different groups of people who think another 45,000 plus different groups of people, reading the same book, worshiping the same God, are fricking it up a little bit. And that doesn't include the rogue outliers, just random dudes in their cabins around the world who think they're the only one who gets it. I'm so sorry, no one else understands your glory, Lord. I wish more people could get it, like my landlord, my ex-wife, if they could cut me some fucking slack. I don't have a job because I'm focusing on your glory. Basin laws on religious thinking, like you might as well just base laws on which rooster wins in a cock fight. It's absurd. And if you don't like that because maybe you are a religious person, you don't think that's fair. Well, would you like it if we had a politician who was not necessarily religious but spiritual, who channeled the spirit world to make major decisions? Because for me, it's the same kind of thing. I don't think many people would be comfortable with that. Some politician coming out and be like, all right, everybody, we're going to war with Russia. I know it's a big decision. And at first I was against it. But last night, I held a science. And I was able to channel the spirits of George Washington and Julius Caesar and some guy named Todd. Julius and George and Todd told me to push that fucking button, so here we are. And I know some people will be offended by that comparison. They're like, you just presented an extreme example. And most people who are religious are moderate in their beliefs. That doesn't make me feel better. Like moderate versus extreme in that spectrum. To me, that's like saying, like, hey man, I don't appreciate you questioning my decision-making abilities. I don't make all my decisions while I'm high on fucking crack. I smoke crack on Easter and Christmas. And the rest of the year, I just kind of think about hitting that pipe. I do understand that anyone who didn't care for my first analogy did like that a second. Except that. And the left, just worrying about the most fragile members of society. I'm all for empathy. I'm all for compassion. I just don't want to be overly sensitive when it comes to language selfishly, because then I can't do this fucking job anymore. Every joke I tell has a victim. I mean, that seemed like it, but they're all offensive. If you break them down, even the ones that don't seem offensive. I'll prove it by trying to tell the same bit twice. I'll tell it the first way, just as I normally would, not worrying about someone's going to be upset or not. And then I'll try to tell the same story again, but making sure that no one could be triggered or bothered by any of the language I use. And we'll see which kind of comedy you prefer. Which makes me a little nervous here. You fucking soft Minneapolis motherfuckers. We'll try it anyway. Way number one, right? A lot of times when I'm standing in a line, I find myself getting very frustrated, because I feel like the other people in the line are fucking it up to some degree. They don't have the distance right between themselves and the next person in line. That's how you do a line correctly. About three feet keeps it nice and tight. Not to lose, not to crowd it. You get more than three feet. Now you're causing a lot of unnecessary stress and confusion for everyone behind you. They're not sure they're in line anymore. They're falling into different states of existential crisis. What is a line if there's no rules? What is life with no one respects lines? Who am I? I should take my clothes off. Shit on the counter. We should fucking burn this place. Nothing matters. Anything less than three feet now the person directly in front of you is overly concerned with being murdered. And that's not fair. Maybe you want to stand three feet apart, but you're not spatially inclined. All right, well I've come up with a training regiment for you to help you get it. Every time you go in public until it becomes second nature, just carry around a heavy old school wooden yardstick. It's a nice visual representation of three feet. It's about like this mic stand if I push it down to the middle. It's about like here. I'm just walking around with it. This is weird, but it's not illegal. And it's an excellent confidence booster. I feel way more confident now than I felt ten seconds ago. Less worried about these people in the front. And then when you get to the back of the line that you want to be a part of, I want you to stop and assess the situation. Put one end of that stick against your waist. And then just march forward, slowing, skipping. Until you tap that last person in the back and that's when you stop. And they're going to have questions and concerns. What the hell is wrong with you? Just stand your ground, don't let them bully you. Just calmly explain yourself. I'm trying to get better. And if they still hassle you at that point when you have to beat him with that stick, you don't let them impede your personal growth. But three feet, not inches. That's very important. Don't pull a spinal tap. Don't be that close to the ass of the person in front of you. Don't be so close to just a casual hip stretch. You're just trying to open up your root chakra. Now you're rubbing your mayor of fun town up against their not-now button. Don't be ringing their not yet, Bell. Not yet, go round to the front. See if you're welcome to the living room and spend some time there. Get to know the family, find out what they like. Come back in 45 minutes, find out if that back door escaped open enough, Bell. That last part was confusing. Don't even worry about it. You're not ready for that joke. Your loophole is pure. I didn't think that was too offensive, right? No one died. But every part of that bit was offensive. And frankly, I'm ashamed of you for laughing at it. I'll try it again in the second way where I'm not going to possibly bother anybody with my language. A lot of times when I'm standing in line, I get really frustrated. Because I feel like the other people in line are fucking it up to various... Who, apologize for the profanity? I do know that a lot of our vulgar vernacular has a very kind of misogynistic history and bringing it up is very traumatic for a lot of people. I apologize. I should have said freaking. No, I shouldn't have. Replacement words are actually more offensive than the very vulgarity they represent by forcing you to complete that traumatic circuit in your head. And I apologize for putting that on you. I was going to talk about space and line, but really, who died and made me the king of lines? No one. If I have a problem with the amount of space other people need in line, then I need to see therapy for my anger issues. Maybe some people need more than three feet because they have social anxiety, which is very real. Maybe some people need less than three feet because they're lonely and crave human contact. And I'm going to push them away. Why do I build such walls around my heart? I'm ashamed to admit it, but I was actually going to advocate for you to carry a large stick around in public in a menacing fashion. How triggering for the victims of stick attacks. No, sir. I mean, no, ma'am. I mean, no them. It's just too complicated to talk that way. I would rather burn you motherfuckers alive than have to do comedy like that. But these two parties we have, and we essentially do have a two party system. How did we get stuck with these two ideological dumpster fires? And I hate that the two party system seems to have created a sports rivalry, mindless tribalism vibe in American politics. Which is great for sports. Mindless tribalism is built for a sports rivalry. That's what we're supposed to get that out of our system. Be part of a team, cheer, boo, have all that emotion. Do it in a place where the stakes don't matter. That's the beauty of sports. Right? It doesn't actually matter who wins or loses. Right? The results are actually pretty trivial. Right? It's easy. You don't have to think much about it because it doesn't matter. You just go, you root for this jersey, you boo for that jersey, you high five this tip shit, you drink this beer, you have a great fucking time. Go fight win. Right? Because it's not like if your team loses, your property taxes go up. There's nothing real right in on it. You're not like, come on, one more touchdown on my brother Gary. He can marry his boyfriend. Let's fucking go. This means everything. Oh, it doesn't mean anything. But in politics, like the stakes are actually important, but people treat it like a sports rivalry. You know, I feel like a lot of the people doing the loudest yelling, especially online. They don't even understand their own party's platform. It's not about logic for them. It's about being part of a team. They just want to cheer and boo. Induce them, Yelly. Why do I root for team Democrat? Well, because they're tolerance. And I am very tolerant. No one has ever been as tolerant as we are. We have the most tolerant team of all time. We tolerate literally everything. Except anyone who even slightly disagrees with us on one issue will fucking burn your shit to the ground. If you don't bend the knee to tolerance. Go fight, win. Why do I root for team Republican? Well, for starters, because I don't hate America. Lib Tard, listen to fuck up. I love this team, because this team loves everything I do. Aggressive bumper stickers. Kid Rock. Flags on the back of my truck. Feels like I'm in a parade. Very emotional. And I feel like this supposed culture war we're having with these two teams is largely media manufactured. Right? It serves politicians and mass media to have these simple narratives and put us into two voting and marketing camps. Doesn't do much good for families and neighbors and friends. But it's great for, you know, those kind of systems. And I just don't buy it. I just don't think that there really is a culture war because if there was these two teams, then most of the people you meet should be on one of these two teams. But I don't find that to be the case. I find most of this to be somewhere in the middle. We all of our card art beliefs, take a little from here, take a little from there, build our own individual identity. And you don't hear enough about that on the news because it's not a sexy, simple narrative. But I know people who identify as Democrat, who are also gun owners and pro law enforcement. I pro law enforcement, but you never hear about that on that side. Maybe there's people who have thought about how they might feel a little hypocritical. If they were adamantly against both those two things, and then somebody broke into their house, and they were unarmed and scared. And they had to call the people they supposedly hate, and really hope they bring the weapons they also supposedly hate. Because who else is going to call in that situation? They're vegan pacifist friends to come over and verbally deescalate shit. Don't kid yourself. Everyone wants to show for us sometimes. I also know people who identify as conservative, Republican, who are pro choice. You don't hear about that a lot. Maybe there are just people who used to be pro-life, but then one night they had to change their heart. One night they forgot to pull out like everybody else and shit got real. And they got harder to stand on that moral high ground. And they were just like, oh my heck, I'm in quite a pickle now. How did I get here? I do love Jesus, but if I'm going to be honest with myself for a few seconds, I did love that pussy a little bit more. I just felt so good, I didn't want to leave. Now what do I do? On the one hand, yes, Jesus does love all the little children this I know. But on the other, he also forgives, so maybe fuck this one. Another brings a comedy crowd together like abortion. Another puts the F in fun like fetus, right? Speaking of abortion, what kind of handmaid's tail shit is going on in this country? Glory be to Gilead. Blessed be the fruits. Starting Texas, this old wave of legislation. When they decided, these guys down there decided that there be no abortion after six weeks, even in cases of rape and incest. And no matter which side of the argument you stand on, doesn't that feel a little unfair that it is always dudes, deciding to regulate women's reproductive rights every single time without exception? And it never even feels like the right kind of dudes. Like a lot of times when I see a politician who is staunchly pro-life, one of the vibes he kind of gives me, one of the thoughts I have is, he doesn't eat pussy. Because it scares him. He's skittish about it. Fills him with all these shameful dirty thoughts and he wants to punish and regulate that pussy. Crazy thing to me about the Texas situation is the guy who signed the Bill into law, Governor Abbott. I don't know how much you know about him, but he's been paralyzed from the waist down for over 30 years. Is that absurdity or irony? The guy who signed the most controversial sexual consequence Bill into law in decades can't stand up and fuck. Feels like a dick move, a limp dick move, technically. It just feels unfair because he's never going to have to deal with the consequences, never going to blow back on him. I feel like the moral equivalent would be if I was Governor, and I signed the Bill into law, raising the angle of the handicap ramp from about five degrees to around 60. And then if anybody gets upset, I can just be like, I'm gonna fuck like a walk. Not my fault, you want more careful in that trampoline? I know that one gets sad the longer you think about it. Do you know how he got paralyzed? He was jogging. He was out jogging randomly, so over 30 years go down in Texas, and he was running under a large oak tree, and it randomly just split in half, and half of it fell on him. True story. Even God hates this motherfucker. I mean, that's a sign. That's a sign. I know for a lot of people, it doesn't matter what jokes they make about this, because it's not a joking issue. It's a matter of life. Right, and six weeks was chosen because that's when a fetus begins to develop a brain. And that's true, and that's a powerful emotional argument. But it's not a complete argument. Yes, fetus does have a brain at six weeks. But not a good one. It has a little bug brain. No more capable of advanced intellectual decision making than say the trillions of sperm cells lost in buttholes every year, but no one talks about that. That is tragic. What a dirty trick. Shot into a dark tunnel to complete their one life mission. And find that sweet, sweet egg. But see nothing but shit, literally. Spending their final confused moments in lube and numbing cream. I can't feel my tail, John, I'm scared. That's how you lighten up a heavy topic, butthole jokes. It's old cat skills trick. Penny Youngman taught me that one. Huge butthole guy. I know this is a very emotional topic for many. I feel like it becomes overly emotional for some because the pro-choice side of the argument is chronically misrepresented. It gets presented as a pro-obortion argument, which is very different. You can be morally opposed to abortion and be pro-choice. You just want to enforce your morality on the body or circumstance of a stranger. It's a pro-freedom argument. Let people choose for themselves. Pro-obortion highly unlikely, you're ever going to meet somebody who's legitimately pro-abortion. That's a serial killer. With an especially dark target demographic. Imagine how horrific that would look in real life. That would be like, there's some lady that you've known for a while, and you know that she never wanted kids, like, adamantly against kids. You haven't seen it a little while. She goes back in your life very visibly pregnant. And you're just curious. You're like, oh, hey, Susan, I... Congrats, I guess. I didn't think you ever wanted to have children. And then she just says something cartoonishly evil. I don't. Mama just gets so hungry. Then you notice a row of tiny skeletons on her necklace. Just... Mama's trophies. Yeah, that was dark, even for me. I know. Also not real. That's some 1950s propaganda poster shit. Last thing I'll say about this is I do think most people on the pro-life side of the argument have their heart and the right place. They're fighting for life, hard to find something more noble than that. I just think it tends to come from a religious place, which again is not supposed to enter the political arena in this world. But everybody at right? But everybody I know who is staunchly pro-life, right? Their belief system boils down to some version of, because God said, thou shalt not kill. Like, yes, the Christian God did say that. But also said, so much other shit that no one ever pays attention to. And that's what's frustrating. Because I'm a student of the Bible, and God said that in the old Wizard D. and D. section. Which was supposed to have been replaced by the Newer section in particular to the Gospels. Messages in there that everyone ignores. Like in the book of Matthew, one of the messages chronically ignored it says, if you're hand-lead you into sin, you're supposed to cut it off and cast it out. I see a lot of fucking hands here tonight. I bet a lot of those fingers have typed out porn hub with the equivalent more than once. How serious are we about these rules? And then people say, well, that part's interpretive. That's not literal. That's interpretive. No, should all be literal or all be interpretive. So people can stop bending, you know, little parts to their kind of wills and agenda. So maybe if the new stuff is interpretive, well, maybe the old stuff is too. Maybe the tone of the commandments got lost on the righty. Maybe they weren't so authoritative. Maybe they were actually delivered, you know, more whimsically. Something like, thou shalt not kill fucking Will and Nilly? Well, yeah, sometimes a motherfucker has to die. Serial killers pedophiles left their bodies, hit their floor. Left their pockets, hit their floor. Last book of drowning pool. You know, when I was putting together new hour material, I thought that that last piece would be the most offensive. Now it's wrong. This next piece is. Which was confusing to me at first because I understand what that last segment of material is polarizing. But this next section, I was like, what's wrong with it? But then I remembered how emotional and illogical people can be with animals. You start talking about killing cute innocent forest creatures and people get uptight. So I don't hear many comics do bits about hunting because it makes people too sad. But it shouldn't. Hunting is a kindness, really is. Everyone should be in favor of ethical hunting. I don't care if you're a vegan animal rights activist. You should cheer when a deer takes a bullet to the head. You really should. If you don't, you're thinking with your heart and not your brain. You're not thinking about what happens when the bullet misses. I'll tell you what doesn't happen. That deer doesn't scamper further into the forest to have a dizzy jamboree with his closest pals. Just so, bam, no cesarees, no simple bell, no cesarees. Now don't forget about your worry and your strife. Do you have a lot to be strifeed about? Hunting is a nice thing to do to animals. Do you remember that last time you saw a really old deer out in the woods limping around and joining its golden years? Nope, because they don't exist. If a hunter doesn't take a deer out, something worse will. A more aggressive predator or starvation or disease. I've seen hunters do a lot of things. I've never seen them do something as cruel as what happens in so much of the rest of nature. I've never seen a hunter shoot a deer in the lake. Instead of taking a second to fire a second quick kill shot to put the deer out of its misery, instead just set that rifle down. Smile, here we fucking go, deer. Just decide to toy with it for a while. Just chase it down as the deer limps away in terror. Maybe grab it by the antlers, punch it in the head to stun it. Take a bite out of its neck. But then not kill it so it can enjoy warm blood a couple hours later. Hunters don't do that, but bears do. People don't get mad at bears. They're like, yeah, they're part of nature. So are we, and we're way better than bears. I used to try and tell a story about one of my first hunting trips early on when I was doing stand-up. And I stopped, because I made people too sad. But now I've been doing this for a long time and I don't fucking carry more. You should enjoy this story. It's a happy story. If you find yourself start to get sad at any point. Just remember it has a happy ending. The deer was delicious. I was 12 years old and I was hunting with my grandpa Ward. Papa Ward taught me how to hunt. He's a great dude, good hunter. Yeah, he's a great guy. And he liked to do a kind of hunting that a lot of other hunters do frown upon. It's illegal in a lot of everywhere. It's illegal everywhere. He called it truck hunting. It's a really nice way to hunt. It's very comfortable. You just drive along the road and you try to find a deer on the same road that you're on. And ideally, you just kind of shoot it on the road, throw it in the back of the truck and keep it moving. There's no hiking, no weather, no tree stand bullshit. Your climate control, comfy seat. You got the radio. There's a small chance you'll shoot another motorist, but hey, life's risky. And we're looking for white tail bucks on this old logging road in Central Idaho. And we're not seeing anything. It's almost lunchtime we're about to give up. They're probably better down for the day. But then right before we call it, it was beautiful. This majestic white tail buck comes from the brush underneath road about 70 yards down the road. It just comes up from the brush, stops in the middle of the road and looks at us and stays there. Like it knew what we wanted it to do. And grandpa slowed the truck to a stop. He's like, Danny, get your shot. Get your shot. So I start to get out of the truck and line up my shot. As I'm doing that, oh my god, so much better. A doe now comes from the same brush where the buck came from. Comes up onto the road, stands right behind the buck and stops. They know each other. My husband and wife, they're a mating pair. I know, it was beautiful. I take a second to admire it before I start to get my shot set up again. And then before I pull the trigger, it was so incredible. Twin Fonds. I write, how lucky are we to win this mess? The whole family's there, dad, mom and the kids. They're staring at me, I'm staring to dad through the scope of my rifle. And I felt like we shared a moment of mutual respect. Before I pulled the trigger and it was best case scenario. I shot him right in the eye, literally blew his brains out on his family and they scampered away in tear. Don't focus on that part. Focus on the part where dad died a clean painless death. I felt like if he knew what was happening to him and could have communicated to me before the bullet hit him, he would have said, you're a great kid and you're doing the right thing. Thank you for the kindness. I feel like his kids as they scampered away with his blood on them, if they would have understood what was happening, they would have been like, I'm gonna send him my dad so well. But for some reason this story makes people sad. I even had one lady one time say to me after hearing this story, she said, what that do you ever do to you? Well, I'm glad you're sitting down because there's more to this tale. I used to try and tell that first story on stage, but I never told this next part. I've never talked about this on the podcast. I just haven't been ready. The wound was too fresh, you know, but I've done a lot of therapy and I feel like I can discuss it now. But I used to have an older brother. His name was Richard Bartholomew. I knew him as Dick, Dick Becommans. A very true story. His older brother and growing up I worship Dick. For me the son rose and said on Dick, and that dear we found that day was no accident. We've been tracking that dear. It was revenge killing. Because six months earlier that same dear raped my brother, Dick, to death. Oh, you didn't know they could do that. Wait the fuck up Minneapolis in your liberal bubble with your fake news. The whole report on an epidemic of dear rape deaths. You have it known terror until a horny buck is kicked in your front door. Which can take two to three hours because it's less of a kick and more of a steady whittling. With their little hateful hooves and they whittle and they whittle. And they build the tension and they rip off your pants. Which can take a couple of days because they don't have fingers or thumbs. And it's less of a rip in more of us just a kind of a clumsy slapping really. A lot of people get tired of being slapped and they take their own pants off to get it over with. Which leads to a lot of victim shaming which is not okay. I feel like a lot of you don't believe this story. I get it. It's a lot taken. I bet I know what you're hung up on. I bet you're thinking like, okay, so let me get this right. So this deer gets in your house and Dickie B is naked on the floor. At least from the waist down. But he's laying down. How would a deer with this limited range of motion and flexibility be able to kind of missionary position your brother? Like wouldn't he have to say help out maybe stand up and seductively present himself to be mounted? Yeah, he did do that. It's called Stockholm syndrome. People fall in love with their captors. Doesn't make a less tragic. I still feel like a lot of you people don't believe this story. I get it. I get it. I bet I know what you're hung up on now. I bet you think, okay, even if all of that happened, which is insane. How would it? How would the deer kill your brother? I watch a lot of nature documentaries and I have the exact size of a deer penis memorized. And I know for a fact they cannot kill a human grown male through sodomy. Okay, he didn't die literally. He died figuratively when he left our family to start a new life in the woods with his deer lever, which was tough for me to emotionally process. R.I.P. Dickie B. M.S. your brother. I know that was a lot. I want you to know that I know that was a lot. I know that joke's not for everyone. I run a lot of these stories by my wife, Lindsay, before I tell them on stage. And I told that story to Lindsay before I ever told a to an audience. And I believe her exact feedback was, that's fucking dumb. Tough but fair, okay? Maybe that's not the funniest story you've ever heard, but I don't just grade new comedic top. I have two topics on just humor. I have two categories. How funny is it? And how original is it? And maybe that's not the funniest story. But I dare you to find another comic out there telling a long form story about his fake brother being fake raped by a fake deer to fake death. Passing value for me. I was just trying to talk about hunting and I got sidetracked. I was just trying to talk about it. You do have to be careful though talking about animals. People get so sensitive. Like a lot of people don't like it if you admit that you just don't care about a lot of endangered species. Because they don't. I like some. I like the strong ones. The weak ones are supposed to die. That's what nature is always done. But we just get too sad now. We get too emotional with animals. We become like weird hoarders. Don't touch that sloth. I might want to look at it in 30 years. No, fucks lost. Let them die. We're wasting a lot of money on sloths right now. They could go to cancer research or ending homelessness. They wouldn't keep surviving if we didn't keep subsidizing them and propping them up. I don't believe they ever survived on their own in the first place. Have you ever fucking seen a sloth? There's no way that thing's important to the environment. If we let them all die tomorrow, I promise you we're never going to regret it. We're not going to panic 20 years from now. I'm like, oh no! What have we done? Look at these trees. They have way too many leaves on them. If only we still had a creature that could eat a few of the leaves but never that many because it's so slow and pathetic. But now we're just stuck with this lush foliage forever. A lot of people get real worked up about sea turtles. We're going to save these sea turtles. Sea turtles raped my brother to death. My other brother, I do. You step through your brothers. Now I like sea turtles. I do. And they're important. They're important to the environment. They're not just cute. They are important. I do hope we can keep sea turtles around. But here's the thing. I'm going to be honest with you guys. I feel like I'm in a safe space. It's not the most likeable thing to say. That's how I feel my heart. I don't hate sea turtles. I just don't like them as much as plastic straws. I have sensitive teeth. I didn't ask for it. It's my cross-bear. And I like an ice mocha. And if I don't use a straw, the ice... Oh, it will hit my teeth and it is very out cheese. Oh, you betcha. And some people are like, why can't you just use a paper straw? Because those aren't real. Those are practical jokes in straw form. Those are brain aneurysm starter kits. But I hope we can keep sea turtles around. I'm not going to do anything to try, but I hope you guys do. There's actually only one endangered species that I'm truly just rooting for it to finally be just totally dead. Just extinct. That's a northern spotted owl. Fuck them. They've done enough. We don't need them anymore. Right? They've caused enough problems. In the Pacific Northwest, up to 130,000 logging jobs gone, not replaced to save this owl. Right? Little towns like mine destroyed when the sawmill was not rebuilt. By conservationists who want to save this owl who are just thinking with their hearts and not their brains. Because all of that was done, they're still going to die. And everybody where I grew up knew that many years ago. They're like, why are we wasting this money? There are other better owls in the same woods. The look almost identical to this piece of shit. That we don't have to do anything to try and keep them around. Right? The spotted owl, it just outlived its time. Had a good run, now it's over. It just refused to evolve. It's just too pathetic and needy. Like it only wants to nest an old growth Douglas fir pine trees. That's why you can't log around it. It only wants these old trees. The branches have to be broken and the right angles towards the top. And then this little fucking dip shit will be grudgingly nests there. I get to live there. Ugh! And then it wants 20 square miles of hunting territory around this tree where it'll eat one kind of mouse and one kind of squirrel. Unless a competitive predator also wants that mouse and squirrel. And then this thing basically gives up and dies. I'm even wanting now! I don't even think it's strong enough to make a proper whew! I bet it sounds more like a whew! Stop it! Yeah, now this thing is being taken out by nature. Right? Doing what we were unwilling to do. In the funniest extinction event I've ever heard of. Mother Nature has chosen to send another owl into kill this owl. Last couple decades the Eastern Bard owl has started to migrate from the East Coast to the Pacific Northwest. Never did that before. No human intervention. It's like it just heard, finally, through the Al Greyfine. But there was a bunch of easy territory in the Northwest being poorly guarded by a bunch of emo sad boy owls. A bunch of weak anemic owls, depressed, living in trees, you know, troubled relationships with their parents, unrealistic romantic expectations. Still painting their fingernails black and listening to dashboard confessional. Who I do actually like. And these Bard owls, these things are hardy. They are strong. They'll nest anywhere. They'll live in the Charlie Brown Christmas tree. They don't go fuck. They'll eat anything. They're not picky. They could probably live mostly on Skittles Rappers and Mountain Dewcans. And they're powerful. They're hardy. I don't think they make a whew! Either it's more like a Rick Flair like a whew! Whew! These Bard owls are coming off the top rope. And they're not just pushing the spotter out of their territory the last couple years, environmentalists figured out that they're actually literally fucking them into extinction. They just figured out that the male Bard owl can successfully mate with the female spotter owl. And his genes are so much more dominant and expressive that the baby owlets are essentially all Bard ow. These motherfuckers are sky Vikings. And some people get sad about this story. I think it's a great cautionary tale for our species to learn from. If you want to continue to thrive on this planet, we have to work hard, adapt, evolve, or we're going to get fucked on off of it. Whew! Now, feel a Bard ow. Alright, I don't want you guys to think I'm a psychopath when it comes to animals. So, do like... Now, I want to share a nice animal story. Because I also can be an emotional illogical thinker when it comes to certain species. Like dogs. I am definitely a doodles. I'm a weird dog person. For sure. I love Penny Pooper and Ginger Bell so much. And I love them so much. And my wife Lindsey loves them, you know, too. But I've actually become the weirder dog person than her. I never expected that. Going into it. Like, I was more worried about her when we got them. And I tried to discuss some ground rules. I'm like, okay, we're gonna get some dogs. But they're not gonna ever sleep in our bed. That's just for us. We don't need to buy them a ton of toys. They can't count. They don't know how many toys they have. And we're never gonna dress them up because they're dogs, not little people. I don't think I made it five minutes into the first night of trying to create train Penny before I was the one who broke. Like, she just kept whining. And I was begging Lindsey to let her sleep with us. She's dying in there. She's failing to thrive. Now I let Penny and Gigi pick their spots on my side of the bed first. And then I just kind of work around them to sleep. And we have two giant toy bins because I don't think our precious babies should ever have to walk too far to get their favorite play things. And we've invested heavily in dog hoodies because they are adorable. Like having two furry college kids with tails running around your house. And then lately I took my level dogs to a place that not even Lindsey and the kids are comfortable with. It was one night when it was just the dogs and Lindsey and I at home, I'd had quite a bit to drink. And I was holding Penny like a baby. I like to hold my dogs like babies. I don't know if they like it, but I like it. It's hard to read their expressions. I don't know if it's love and adoration or panic and terror. And I was eating a burrito. And I had a really weird thought. I was like, I wonder if I can feed Penny like a mama bird to a baby bird. And that was the reaction that Lindsey had when I said that out loud. She was like, please do not do that. That's so gross. I'll never want to kiss you again. And so I was going to set Penny down. But then I just looked at her precious little face and her little teddy bear eyes looking at me. And I felt like she was trying to communicate with me. Baby bird is hungry mama bird. Baby bird is starving. So I took a big bite of burrito and just kind of half chewed it up and then dangled it up my mouth and let her kind of lick it off my teeth. And I know that's gross, but it was also the most maternal I've ever felt. Lindsey was horrified. And then she told the kids. And they were horrified. So naturally I started to do it in front of them when they were over at the house. Because I wanted to see the reaction in real time. And they hated so much. The only thing they hate more is me talking about it publicly because it's going to get back to their friends. And I don't really want to embarrass them. I've tried to back off on material about the kids last couple years because they're an awkward social age. And I want to, you know, the repercussions of that. But I do want to take the mama bird baby bird thing a little farther. Because Monroe is 14 and she's never dated anyone that were aware of. She's never brought anybody home. But she will eventually. She'll bring somebody home. And I used to think it would be funny to be the stereotypical cleaning the shotgun debt. Kliche, you know, it's pretty played out. And also way funny or to be the baby bird debt. Oh my God. What a great moment that be just some awkward teen, all tense and, you know, nervous to meet Monroe's father and trying to be on their best behavior. And then they come through the door and I'm just waiting for them 10 feet behind the door. Just baby birding penny just. Are you willing to love my daughter? I love my baby bird. She'll be furious for months, but I'll be laughing about that on my deathbed still. I want my defining moments. Right enough to talk about animals. I have some more groundbreaking, very important political thoughts to share. When you're out in a area with a lot of other people like at a big outdoor concert or at the fairgrounds and you're looking around at the rest of humanity, are you comforted or horrified by understanding that they also get to vote? Like do you look around and think like, yeah, this is great. We're in good hands. Or do you look around and think, how is the ship not already sunk? I just think it's crazy that you don't have to know anything about politics or politicians to be able to vote. Like nothing. You should have to pass some kind of test. I think a fair test would be you have to match a photo of the politician you're voting for to their name. That's it. Just photo to name. Like you don't even know what they look like. There's no fucking way you understand anything about them. And I bet a lot of people will get that wrong. Right? You'd be like, no, that's not Biden. That's an autopsy photo of a 117 year old man. That photo was taken six weeks after he died. No, that is not Trump. That is Emperor Palpatine. That's a dark wizard. That is not Hillary Clinton, but you're very close. A lot of people get that wrong. That's a mug shot of actor Gary Busey. I know that's a silly joke. I wrote that in about 30 seconds late one night when I was just looking at pictures of Gary Busey and I was like, holy shit. Uncanny. But I just I do worry about certain people's decision making abilities. Says the guy who wants to baby bird his dogs. Some people decision they're like they're so objectively bad and just over and over. I'm like, I don't know that they should be voting. Like I'll give an example of who I'm talking about. There's a social media influencer Stephanie Motto. You may not recognize her name, but you probably will remember what she became infamous for. She made over $100,000 one year selling jars of her farts. Right? She far into a jar, seal it off and get a guy to pay up to $2,000 to buy that jar of farts. And business was so good there was so much demand she ended up in the ER. Thought she was having a heart attack. Nope, just a lot of gas in her chest, which is what happens when you turn your body into a fart factory. And the doctor tried to get her to retire, which she wouldn't, which she got smarter in the fart game. Started to fart less, but actually sell more fart jars in a way. Now what she would do is she would fart into a jar, seal it off, take a picture of this jar and then sell a limited number of digital photos as NFTs. And now she got guys to pay up to $200 a pop for a picture of a jar they hope has a fart in it. And you know these are jerk off photos. That's what those guys are doing. They're beating off these photos. And they say you're not supposed to kink shame, but what the fuck is wrong with these guys? Who broke them? What series of bad decisions led to you only been able to come to a picture of a jar you hope has a fart in it? I just picture the saddest demographic for these fart jar. Just some dude, he was able to buy it with the birthday card money he got from his grandma. And he's sitting in the room that was supposed to be his mom's cross stitch studio, but he refuses to move out. And the door is locked and he's in a dark room. The only light is the computer monitor. Just a picture of an empty jar. And he's sitting in his gaming chair and he's got his sweatpants pushed down to his ankles. And his Pokemon shirt rolled up to his armpits. And he's got his bruised and battered cock in one hand. A dick that's never known a woman's gentle touch, only the cold callous grip of an angry in cell. And his other hand, he has his phone, he's DMing Stephanie Mato. He's like, you promised there's a fart in the jar, right? I don't want to come to an empty jar like an idiot. I just think maybe that guy shouldn't be a little vote. Stephanie Mato should be president. She's a genius. If you can sell jars of maybe farts, sky is the limit for your entrepreneurial activity. I don't know, maybe instead of having some people not be able to vote, maybe just people's voting power should differ from one another. Maybe when you turn 18, you get one vote. But then you can get more votes if you make better decisions going forward. AI bots are something just monitored your life choices. And you can go down to no votes if you make terrible decisions. Maybe you learn CPR because you're a good person. You just want to help others. Yeah. And then one day you're out at the park and you see someone in this pond in the middle of the park, they're drowning. And you risk your life to save the life of this stranger. Why are they even swimming in this pond in the first place? But you run out there and you swim out there and you bring them back to short and you breathe life into their lungs. That's beautiful. You get 15, 20 extra votes. But what if like a month later, same park, you get caught beating off in the bushes when now you have no votes. You're all over the place. You're too inconsistent. We have no idea what you're going to do in the booth. I can't trust you. Also, we should change the criteria for who gets to run for higher office because there's almost no criteria right now. It's crazy. Like to become president, you just have to be at least 35 naturalized citizens, resident for at least 14 years. You could also be a felon. You could have a variety of felonies. You couldn't vote for yourself, but you could run. Yeah, that's true. You could be a level three sex offender and technically become president. You could be the first president not allowed to live in the White House because it's too close to a school. That's technically possible. You can actually murder somebody and become a senator. Again, couldn't vote for yourself, but could run. In one random scenario I thought of, I think murdering someone is the best way for you to become a senator. Check out this long con. I've thought up. You don't have to be 30 to run for the senate. That's pretty young. Let's say you're running for senate, you're 30 years old, you get close. You get down to the last two or three, but you know you're not going to win. If you really, really want to be senator someday, here's what you do. You publicly execute your main rival. Right? You're going to get in a lot of trouble. You're going to go to prison. But if you have a good lawyer, no priors, and behave yourself while you're in prison, there's no way you're getting more than 30 years. Now you're 60 years old. Pretty young for a politician. You get out and you run again. And this time you will win. Who in the right mind is going to run against you? You'd have some wild ass campaign slogans too. Vote for Cummins, because no one has to die. Not again. Also crazy that there's no educational or prior work experience requirements for the highest political offices. Like running the biggest economy in the world could be your first job. You don't have to know how to read, count to five, nothing. There's no equivalent for that in the corporate world because it's really fucking stupid. The corporate equivalent would be if a company every four years, they gathered every employee in the warehouse, and took a vote to decide who's going to lead the company the next four years. Does it matter what your position is? Anybody can be president. Companies would fold left and right. Good job guys, you did it. I'd like to welcome the new president and CEO of Advanced Biotech Nanotechnology. You may recognize him from the cafeteria where he's worked part-time for the last three weeks. Bob Anderson, better known as Hot Dog. Hot Dog Anderson, start sending out those resumes. Thank you. That's what I was hoping for for Hot Dog Anderson. The crowd in general never likes Hot Dog Anderson as much as I do. You get it. Well, I hope none of the material I told tonight upset you too much, especially the political stuff. And if it did, I hope you can just kind of grow up and get the fuck over it and stop being such a crybaby. Thank you so much for that right now. We have too many people that just want to wallow in their own echo chamber and just refuse to hear any other dissenting points of view. And that is not a healthy way to have a society. There's always going to be a lot of different opinions. The best way to have a healthy society is to have compromise and discourse. But we don't do that right now as a society, right? We just scream at each other. We're in a relationship of sorts. And so we should communicate and talk things out and work on it. Like no relationship counselor worth half a shit, seen a couple having trouble, would advise them to do what we do as a society right now. No one would be like, hey, all right guys, stand on other sides of the room and fucking scream at each other. Plug your ears. Don't listen to the person. Never back down. Never apologize. That's what we do. It's crazy. I wish we had more people like my grandpa Ward. He was great hearing other people's opinions. Right, he lived in this tiny little town in Idaho, Riggins, for his entire adult life. And he would have this weekly breakfast with these other guys where they would discuss politics, religion, everything for the last few decades of his life. He was a Democrat, not religious. They were Republican. They were religious. They disagreed on so much. They argued. Things got heated. But at the end of the breakfast, they would still respect each other, shake hands, and agree to meet the next week. And when he was on his deathbed, yeah. And when he was on his deathbed, the last couple of weeks of his life, and he was too sick to go to the diner, those same guys were the ones who came to him and kept those talks going. Right? And finally, after all those years, when he was near death and no longer worried about consequences, he fucking killed him. He had enough of their shit. And he left the world a better place than he found it. No, no. Now, he kept those talks going right into the end. It was beautiful. And those were the guys who cried the hardest at his funeral. It was a beautiful thing. And I think if we could do that as a society, keep talking, not give up on each other, be to Nacius, you know, persevere, keep pushing forward when times get tough. Life could be better than has truly ever been. But we got to work hard to get there and not give up. And that's hard sometimes. And sometimes when I feel like giving up, there's a hero I met about a decade ago that I like to think about who inspires me, to keep going no matter what. And I want to share this person's story with you, maybe they'll inspire you. He was in Santa Monica, California, and Lindsay and the kids and I, we used to go to this 50s diner, this great little nostalgic diner. We get about a block from this place, and we hear the unmistakable sound of a car wreck. We look at the other end of the block. It was this old cutlass, taking a right hand turn off Santa Monica Boulevard, and it starts mashing the first part car it tries to pass. Very slowly, it's just grazing along the side of this car, ripping off the paint, so that popping off the mirror, it could stop, it could tap the brakes and stop at any moment, and just doesn't. So slow, it just mangles this car, and then it proceeds to the exact same thing to the second car it tries to pass. Like we're mesmerized. And as it gets closer, you can see that this is not the first two accidents this car's been in today. Legitimately, it looks like it was driven there from the demolition derby where it took a beating. And it proceeds to hit to some degree, even if it's just a glancing blow, every single parked car on that entire side of the full block. It just kept veering to the right, because its front right tire wasn't just blown, it was completely gone. Just a bent rim, so it's tilted, so it'll try to correct, and then inevitably slam back to the right. And we're wondering, who is driving this? When they come into view, it was an older lady, probably in her 80s, but not who I expected. She seemed very well put together, not disheveled, not disoriented, nothing. Like she was her posture was perfect, she had a great haircut, nice silky shirt, just smile on her face, she had her hands at 10 and 2, she had driving gloves on, which I felt work excessive. Just considering her visible skill set, she had a real happy energy, seemed really positive and upbeat. Her energy could not match up less with the carnage she's leaving in her way. And when she gets to the end of the block where we're standing, I try to stop her, because this is dangerous. I was like, man, stop, stop, stop. She sees me at first and she tries to wave me off. Just takes her hand off the wheel for a second, like, I can out of here, mom has got shit to do. So, I try to get like, man, please stop, stop. She now she stops. She stops, she puts the car in park, I tell her, I'm like, your tire's gone. She turns off her engine, she takes her seatbelt off, safety first. She comes out of the car, walks around, I revealed to her the roughly a million dollars in insurance claims. She's just launched single handedly. And I explained her, this is very dangerous, she's going to hurt herself or someone else, so I got to call this in. And she should call someone to come pick her up. And all she says to me is, okay, still seems very happy. So now she goes, do I assume get her phone? She goes, she gets in the car, shuts the door, locks it, puts her seatbelt back on. Turns over the ignition, puts the car in drive, I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? Starts to creep forward and I try to stop her one last time. I was like, man, please stop, stop. She gives me the most reassuring, calm down buddy, everything's going to be A-OK thumbs up. Just to quick thumbs up. Drives through the intersection, and the next block hits two more cars, press over a little hill, not of our lives forever. That's all I know about her, never sorry again. But I think about her a lot. We've talked about her in the family ever since. We call her the Perseverance Fairy. She refused to be stopped that day. No matter what obstacles life threw at her, I mean they were parked, but you get it. She was going to keep going, and we like to pretend that she is still going somewhere right now. She's still driving. And she'll never stop because she's not a real human. She's a mythological entity sent to inspire us, to remind us to keep pushing forward when we feel like we can't. She shows up at your lowest points, how great would that be? To lose your job, you're down to your last 20 bucks, you want to quit, you're just like, ah fuck it, I give up. But then you hear, mashing metal from down the streets. There she is, still living along. She's like, you know I go, we don't quit brother. Thank you Perseverance Fairy, and thank you for the apples, you guys are great, hey, Lina. Thank you guys so much. I'm going to speed my mind, I'm going, girl you just got up there. Yeah, that was my line, I'm on it. Girl you just ain't no good. And my head now, we been just, out for the laundry, baby. And the time I've got to go with, give it that a look, I'm still your friend. And I must take sure the trail, in the cloud to your day.
I'm gonna tell you that the bar north is real loud, John. Yeah! Yeah! Everybody talking about fucking, man. I don't know, magic, that shit, I ain't no. I ain't down with OPP, HIV, I ain't down with shit. But the brother was brave, because I don't care what you say. Magic came out and told everybody, I got it. That was brave. I don't give a fuck. What you say? I don't care. Because the nigga like me would have never told. I could have been three pounds. Now I ain't shit wrong with me. No, that's no wrong, nigga. I'm fucking with that dick Gregory, but ain't. I ain't shit wrong with me. I know, no, I ain't even safe to fuck no more, man. You can die fucking ain't nothing worth dying for. I can't think of shit I'd die for. If a motherfucker pulled a gun, my mother'd be like, hey, what'd she do? She fuck with your money? I'm sorry, mama, you got to go. You pray all the time, you're going to have a stop crime. I'm not pushing, they're gonna send me to that desert storm. Niggas is a storm over here, fuck that. I'm not dying for nobody. And white people try to trick you. Giving your life in your country, hey, that's the greatest thing you can do. That's bullshit. Remember the coward lives to tell how that brave motherfucker got killed. He ran after cannons and then I ran home. With my check, I'm not dying for nobody. I will write a book about it called going like a motherfucker. Ain't shit worth dying over, man. I'm not pushing. That's why I could never have a job. I was expected to give my life like a secret service agent got a jumper from the president and take a bullet. I could see me my first day at work. I had to put something wrong. What a president? That motherfucker laying in the street. Will you act behind the truck? Niggas? Shit. I'm not dying for nobody because I want to get paid. I don't know about you. I want to be rich. Whatever you got to do to make money long as you don't hurt nobody is fine with me. Like everybody talking about James Worthy, the law saying it's like, we got busted in the motel with two prostitutes. Ladies, how many of you would leave him for that? That's what I thought. That motherfucker make five million dollars a year. For five million dollars a year, James Worthy could fuck me. You understand that? Go and do what you want, James. Now you sure you don't know nobody I know, right? Two weeks later, I'd be on Oprah. Oprah, he used me. James didn't really love me. Yeah, I'm not a bush. And you got to have money to take women to rest for us. Because women go to rest for us to lose. They got their mind. They got to order from that expensive side of the menu, decide what the steak and the lobster and the dumb perillaume. Guys like to give them that little warning too, huh? Who, honey, you understand? That's the fucking side of the menu you understand that. No, no, no, no. No, no. You order from that side of the menu, somebody is fucking you understand that. I'm not saying it's you, but somebody live where you live is fucking me, you understand that? It's steak, lobster, and dick. It is a combination. That's right. I wonder that men and women at home making love, she's going, can we stop now? I'm bitch, you want them chicken wings, you keep going. And you had a doggy back, that means I'm coming back tomorrow. God damn it. Fuck, man. Because black men, black mothers are always the same, and women, they get up, they go old, they become mothers. Black mothers are all, man, when you be way down the street, your mother call your house. Black women was immersed, you runnin' house, come here, come here, you runnin' house. What you want, mama? Turn the TV. It's like, ain't you right next to that motherfucker? I hate her. Make me sick, would you say nothing? Damn. Stinky lady. Mama's stink. I don't know, man. A lot of people believe in heaven, a lot of people believe in hell, man. A lot of people do, man. Somebody asked me did I believe in heaven and hell? I said, I don't know, you know, but then I was reading. I read that 100 million Africans, 100 million Africans, dig this, died in the slave trade. 100 million, man, it's only 250 million people in this country. 100 million people is more than some countries have. That'd be like, that's the third of this country, that'd be like every third motherfucker, everywhere you went, just got up and walked out, never came back. Do I believe in heaven and hell? I believe if you been black, you should, I'm actually get to go to heaven because you don't already cut, hey. That. That. That. That's cheating. She did. But then do that, man. Because I believe in Jesus, I don't want to be one of the brothers that don't believe in Jesus. But what the Bible says, the Bible is scary to see it on it. Jesus is coming back like a thief in the night. The night when you look at it, that's when you do. Most of you're fucking up. You get that knock at that motel door? Who is it? It is on my son. Woo! Girl, put your pennies on that sheet. It's not the door. I gotta go, see ya. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Comedy Central presents... ...Nate Bargette. APPLAUSE Yes, you know. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Wow, everybody. Crazy. I'm proud of every one of you. All right, every one of you I'm proud of. Different. It is great to be here. Very fun to be in New York. I live here, so that's why it's fun. I am from Tennessee, though, originally. And I stubble a little bit of an accent. And they always come up and they're always like, Oh, what's up? Where's your accent from? I'm like, Tennessee. But I like it's cool. I have a cousin that lives in Florida. All right. I don't even... Are we just naming states? Is that what's going on? I don't know what. When I moved to New York, though, it's funny. It's like New York accent. It's a big melting pot. Because it's like all the different cultures. It's not a melting pot at all. It's actually a bunch of pots that one of the next their own kinds of pots. And not talk to other pots. Yeah. It's good stuff. It's good. My landlord is a Chinese pot. And... Which is fun. She only hires like old Chinese dudes to fix her stuff. So, like when they come over, like they don't speak English. And like, I'm not going to learn another language. I have barely knocked this one out. So... So when you fix this stuff, you got to just hope he does the right thing, you know, because you can't tell him not. Maybe he comes over and starts fixing the couch. You're like, all right. I guess that's what he's fixing today. I don't know why we would ask him to do that. But... One day he came over and our gas heat broke. So he comes over to fix it. And I'm staying outside. And I see him like... He's like downstairs. And you see like a fireball just explode like Adam. So, like he like... He runs outside. And you get like we're both standing there. And you could just see that we both wish we could talk to each other at that point. Or just like... That's all I got. I got nothing. I missed this. I missed going down there. I like him. I missed it like... I mean, I'm gonna go Walmart very easily. Well, Walmart guy. I like him. A lot of people don't like Walmart. They say it's big business. Like it kills the mom and pop shops. But really Walmart, they wear a mom and pop shop. At some point, and then they got their act together. And became unbelievable. So... Yeah, I just stuck with him. And then he got there. And he was like, Yeah, I just stuck with him. They're always open. Mama, pop shops close for no reason. You go in there like, why are you closing today? Like we're sad. You're like, all right, that's not even... That's not even a legit, legit thing. Walmart, you could shoot the entire staff. It would be an hour of confusion. And they'd be up and running again. That's how great Walmart is. It's unbelievable. The best. Went to school on Tennessee. Which is fun. I went to a community college for an entire year. And I do not have one credit. It didn't make... None of it counted. The reason is because I had to take remedial classes. So... Which remedial basically means you're like, look, we have no idea how you're high school that you leave. And we are shocked and we're actually going to look into it. But... But until the end, here's your class as you're going to take. Here's what I took. I took math. Like, I don't like the book said math. Like, that's what... How crazy is that? They stopped calling it math after like, six grade. I... I had to take reading. I took reading. I drove to that class. I drove to a reading class. I'm not even an immigrant. I am from here. I should have knocked that out years ago. And with reading, I think they were just impressed when you made it to the class. They were like, look, who made it today, buddy? You're like, fun, you guys. You guys are good. The best. And always, like, it shut down my dream because I wanted to play college basketball. And... That... I didn't work out. I didn't work out because I got cut every year for my high school basketball team. So, I had to play for my church because... Yeah. The church cannot cut you. They have to let you play, which is nice. That's a good, you know. I guess they could cut you. You'd be pretty bad if they'd look. We think you're good, but Jesus does not think that they're good. Yeah. He is our captain. And church ball was a lot different, too, because we played, it was a half-court, no three-point line. We played on carpet. That's your first sign. It's not going to count. And they didn't give us a basketball. We didn't have a ball. Like, we would just stand out there and play on honesty. So, you'd be like, I just made it. It was like, oh, that's a good shot. You're really good. I stole it. I forgive you for stealing it. You're a moral point. You can count later. You have to be careful. I just read about, there's this new device you can buy for your car. And it's got, it's like a key this device. And as you press it, it's got a heartbeat detector on it. So, you aim it at your car, you press it. If it flashes, that means like someone is in your car. And they're going to kill you. All right. It's not going to be good. So, you press it. If you want to buy it, it's like $550. If you do not have that money, you can do the old school route, which is just looking the window. It's either way, really. It's up to you. I told one guy that he tried to tell me that was for like, when people leave their babies in the car. Like, you know, like when you go out and you're like, I cannot remember if I brought my baby today. And I don't want to walk all the way back and check. Like, what if it's not there? If it's not there, I'm going to look like a jackass in front of my friends. I wish I could check secretly without everybody knowing. Here's my method for if someone's going to hide in my car and they're going to kill me. It's a huge fear of mine. So, what I do is, right when I start my car, I have journey, don't stop believing in my CD player. So, right when I start it, it's right on the don't stop believing part. Because that's a great song. Like, you couldn't commit a murder to that song. That is that good of a song. That guy would want to. And then he would like, just be fear, he would just get up and like, look, that's a really good tune. All right, you got me. And then you would climb up front and you become friends. And that's just a neat story. They were like, how do you know Dennis? He was a murderer. Turns out, pretty big journey fan. Actually, a good guy, once you get to know him. He's good. He's good. He's a good guy. Thank you. I've got to travel a lot, which is fun. I get to go, like, I get to go to like different countries. And I don't deserve to get, like, I don't know where these countries are at. I just go, I didn't learn about any of them. Like, I learned about Tennessee. I learned about the states that touched us in case they attacked. And yeah, and I was told the rest was Europe. And that's where all the gays lived. So I didn't have a passport, you know? How's it going? I got to go to Bahrain, which was fun. I, someone's from Bahrain. Are you really? That's crazy. I had no idea it was a country. I'll be honest with you. Three years ago, I'd called you to lawyer, because you're from Bahrain. I literally thought it was the guy we were meeting. Like, that's what I just assumed. I just walked around Bahrain's airport, like, hey, do you know this guy? Bahrain, he's supposed to meet us here. Is he somewhere near here? When we went to Bahrain, we were doing, we did call me for the troops. I don't have like a huge following in Bahrain. But I could start, though, with the one guy right here. So it's one end of time. So we go over there, and when you do come into the, you stay on an army base. But in Bahrain, you can actually leave the base and go to like the downtown Bahrain. So they tell you, when you go out there, they're like, look, it's safe. Just don't draw attention to yourself. So they're like, don't wear American t-shirts and stuff. And you're like, all right, let's find no American t-shirts. So what are you going to do about the white on my skin? Yeah. That's probably going to be the issue. If I, I don't want to come up, excuse me, are you Muslim? Southern Muslim, actually. Is that, my dad was a deacon. That, you know, I really want to go visit Cambodia. That's where it's at, guys. Like, I don't know where it's at, but I know that's where it's at. So that's the good part, you know. Here's what they have in Cambodia. This is a, for real legit tourist attraction that they have. You can shoot a rocket launcher at a cow. Yeah, that's one of their options. All right. And I know you're like, I bet it's pricey. So no, it's not, actually. It's very reasonably priced, which is nice. It's only four hundred bucks. That's not that bad of a deal to shoot a rocket launcher at a cow. And if you're like, well, what if we don't hit it? You know, is it really worth it to take the family there? Yes, it is. All right. No one hits it. Everyone shoots it. They're like, I do this a lot at home. Like, this is kind of... And they're good dudes. They give you 200 bucks back if you don't hit it. So that's a good business. Well, would you not support a business like that? My favorite thing was how they had to come up with that price, four hundred bucks. What on earth do you gauge that off of? Like, someone's like, 500. It's not get greedy with it. I feel... I've been doing some studies and you can fist fight a goat for a hundred bucks down the street. He's not even into it. We're using equipment, so... That would be an unbelievable way to hunt a rocket launcher. They just shoot at the woods and kill... That's like a buffet. You kill like a lot of stuff. That's nice. That would be fun. Animals have it the worst. They died terrible deaths. I heard a story. This kid. He had two goldfish. So he grabbed one of them. He squeezed it and exploded. Yeah. It's pretty crazy. I don't feel bad for that goldfish. Like, you know, he died quickly. I feel bad for the other goldfish that just has to deal with that trauma now. You know what I'm saying that would be? They're not gonna buy this kid another fish. He's killing them. Imagine if you were locked in a room with someone and they just exploded. It would change your life forever. You're like, can I get something else to talk to? They're like, no. You're like, what? I should go deal with this in my own head. I'm not the worst life ever. I still like to eat animals too though. Like, I don't, that story doesn't have any naughty animals. I like chicken a lot. I'm a big fan of chicken. It's weird now because I went to the store the other day to buy some home. And when I was there, they have now they have like two kinds of chicken that you can buy. So they have a free range chicken is one. And then they have, I guess, like a not free range. Like I think his parents were divorced or something. I don't know. So they want you to eat the free range chicken, which is a chicken that is allowed to roam free. Obviously not now, like he is dead at the store. But they still have a list of his hobbies on the package, which I thought, that's pretty nice of him, you know? But I don't eat that chicken. I feel bad. I don't need a chicken that had a dream. And that was that chicken. Life was great for that guy. I just want a miserable not free range chicken. I want to eat a chicken that when they killed it, he was like, look, I'm ready for this. All right. This is brutal. This is the worst. Oh, when I was at the grocery store, I got caught like in this weird thing with his dude. So I was standing in line and I was behind this guy. This white guy. And he pulled out the white race card. Now, I don't know if you'll knew we had a card. But he like had one. So I'm standing behind him. I'm standing behind him. And I just hear him like argue. Like, hear him just go like, what is it? Because I'm white. Is that why you're doing this? Because I'm white. And he looked at me like I'm his brother. Like, hey, are you going to get involved? You're going to come on. I was like, standing there. I was like, no, I'm not getting involved in this. I'm not ready for something like this. I think you're the first guy ever to try this, to be honest with you. I'm not prepared at all. If you wanted me to help you, you should have pulled me aside earlier. You should have grabbed me like, look, I'm going to make history today. Do you want me a part of this or not? It's your call. So I'm married. We have a lot of married people here tonight. A few. Some. That's fun. That's fun. I don't know. I've been married four years now. And it is getting pretty serious today, the truth. A lot. A lot more serious than I thought. I always have, like I have other buddies that are getting married now. So they always like, when they come talk to me. So, like I always tell them they're like, what's it like? Here's what it is. I'm just to everybody. Marriage is like, you ever go to a concert and you see a mosh pit. And you're like, you know what? I'm going to go get that mosh pit. But then once you get in it, you're like, I do not want to be in this mosh pit. At all. I am going to leave and go get some beer. Then the mosh pit is like, didn't you drink last night? All right, mosh pit. Once you get off my back. And let me live my life. Why? My wife's good. She's put up a ton with me. I remember three months into our marriage. One night I came home and I was like really drunk. I was hammered. And I know she loves that. So I spull her a little bit. I'm like a pretty decent guy. So we got a bed. And I'll be honest with you. I peed the bed. Yeah. Shouldn't have. I was pretty good though. I kind of like blamed it on her. Like I remember, I just woke up and I go, hey, what's wet? All right. Did you pour a perfect circle of water underneath me? A flawless circle. She was like, no, you peed the bed. What is wrong with you? Did I marry you or did I have you? I have no idea. I have this point. You know what it is. Here's what it is. Guys, which is not good. Guys are not good at marriage. All right. It's not our fault. We weren't prepared for it. Like women are. Your whole life is built. It's just preparation for marriage. Look at all every toy you played with. When you're a baby, they give you a baby doll. So they give you a baby when you're a baby. You don't even know your life yet. And they're like, look, I would probably start figuring this out. Like this is where it's going. Didn't they give you Barbie and Ken? They live in a little house together. And that is where you learn how to make drama you get. You get the best. You're the best. Then you would play house. Like you would fake vacuum. Just fake vacuum with your friends. That was awesome. And it's weird because when I see my wife vacuum now, like she is living her childhood dream. She's made it. As a guy, we don't have any of that. What do we play for it? You got to keep everybody out of where you are. Especially girls. The only toys we had were transformers and ninja turtles. Those are not even real things. None of them had wives. They weren't married. I never played with my ninja turtles. And I had them go into fight shredder. And then Michael Angelo was like, hey, can you give me two seconds? My wife just showed up. And she looks furious about something. What do you want from me? And she's like, what are you all doing? What's that April skank doing here? You're like, listen. She's a reporter. I got in trouble with my wife because on her last birthday, I got her an oven. Pretty nice oven. Take it easy. The reason I bought an oven, because I know, like the vacuum, her other favorite toy as a kid, was the Easy Bake oven. So to go with her big girl vacuum, I got her. I. So to go with her big girl vacuum, I got her a grown up adult oven. Like there was heart behind it. Like that's not impressive. If she came home and bought me a truck, and it turned into a live robot, I would lose my mind. Freak out. Thank you guys so much for coming out. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Yeah.
I think our immune systems are just getting weaker, you know? I think they are. Unless you grow up in a city. I think if you grow up in a city, you have a stronger immune system, you know, because you're just raised around like taxi cab fumes and rapists and germs, you know? When I was living in New York, I saw a woman on the subway, which is a gross place, as I'm sure you've heard. And she was sitting on the subway car with this newborn baby underneath, bouncing this loose baby underneath. And I say loose baby because she didn't have the container you put them in. What do you call that? The baby cartridge, you know, is the thing. The car's the car carriage. I don't have kids, whatever. Bouncing this loose baby underneath and the baby's sucking out a pacifier. And the pacifier popped out of the baby's mouth and landed on the subway floor. I am not done yet. Luckily, this good Samaritan is a very nice unhoused man. He picks it up by the sucky part and hands it back to the mom. And the mom decantatized the pacifier, puts it in her mouth. And then she gives it back to the baby. You can grow in all you want, Providence, but we know that kid's not going to grow up to be a little blue-ass, gluten-free bitch. All right. So, that's the mother of the year award. He's welcome to the year. How are we doing, Providence? Good. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. Good to be back home. And Rhode Island. Clap it up if you're from Rhode Island. Good. Very proud to be from this state. Our nickname is the ocean state. That's a ballsy move, right? Just the smallest state in the country just up and claim the largest surface on earth. Anybody know where a motto or state motto? Hope. That's it. Period. No. Not even a full sentence. Just one word. Vague. Hope. Done. Hope. At least make it a little bit longer. Make it something specific to the state. You know, like, hope. The unemployment check comes in. Or, hope. I get custody. Something specific to the state. Can you guys tell them product of divorce yet? Is that clear? I was raised by two alcoholic parents. Two? Yeah. Okay. If you have one, that'll lead to trauma. If you have two, that'll lead to trying stand-up comedy. Okay. Showbiz, baby. People are always like, don't forget about me when you're famous. And I'm like, don't forget about me when I'm homeless. Okay. That's what I'm supposed to do. I'm supposed to do that. I'm supposed to do that. They're always like, don't forget about me when I'm homeless. Yes. Both my parents were alcoholics. They divorced when I was young. And to this day, my mom likes to say that divorce was because of my dad's drinking, and my dad likes to say that his plan worked. And it did. When you're a kid, you don't know your parents' alcoholics. They just, you know, you just see them drinking, and you're like, Do you know? Like my mom, like she was like the emotional, reminiscing kind of nostalgic drunk, you know? Like she loved memory. She lives in the past. You know, when my mom drank, she was still like, stay awake till two o'clock in the morning on one of my school nights. You know, chain smoking in the living room. I have asthma. She doesn't give a shit. It's blasting John Denver's greatest hits in the living room. Headphones on, not plugged in. So she keeps turning it up because she thinks it's like low in the headphones. I'm like, da da, enough. She loves photos. She would stay awake very late and just rip out all the photo albums and lay them on the living room floor. She would pull out individual photos and then go to the kitchen and then put them up on the fridge. The fridge was just covered in photos. It was like yarn and thumbtacks away from looking like she's been trying to piece together and unsolved murder from the 70s. She's like trying to find the zodiac killer on the refrigerator. I'm like, mom, give it up. It's a cold case. All right. That's how I found out Santa wasn't real. Yeah. Here's what I would do. Every Christmas I would leave Santa Milkin cookies. But I did something different. I used to write Santa a letter like a question I would ask him. It would be like something silly like Deer Santa. Why is Rudolph's nose red? And my mother after a bottle of white Zinfandel would use sloppy handwriting, misspell some of the words and put some of the letters backwards. So my entire childhood I was like, is Santa special needs? I don't know. That's what I was thinking. What else do I have to go off of, right? I was like, I guess it makes sense. Like he's obsessed with toys and he only eats milk and cookies. I don't know. Maybe a brain injury. He's done a lot of slippery roofs. I don't know. Christmas morning, my mom's all hung over. She's like, Dougie, did you find out why Rudolph's nose is red? I'm like, well, I think Santa landed on his head coming down the chimney we don't have. And now we ride to the short sleigh with the hell as this. It's sticky and it smells like Kaluah. Is this you? I asked why Rudolph's nose was red. You wrote because it fills with blood. What? Like a reaction, mom? Rudolph was just all horned up. Is that what it was? So the following year she tried answering my Santa letter with clippings from newspapers and magazines like a ransom note. Bring the briefcase to the North Pole of the Naughty Bitch Dice. To this day, my mom's texting looks like the Santa letter, right? She doesn't know how to text. She does the voice to text thing. Everything she texts is like these long-winded emotional mom texts that are like half caps lock, half lower case, no indentation, no spell check. Fear to mojis who you've never seen before in your life. It's like she just smashed her head on the keyboard, honestly. That's what it looks like. One time my sister and my mom were in a fight and my mom calls me and she was furious and she's like, Douglas, your sister's not answering any of my texts. I was like, first of all, that's a state. Text messages or texts for short. I was like, second of all, stop texting her all these long-winded things. These novels, she's probably annoyed by you, right? Then she's like, fine. Then she texts me right back and goes, never mind, she just responded. I was like, all right, well, what did she say? My mom goes, what does STFU mean? I responded, it stands for stay together forever unconditionally. It's your rights. I love that so much. And I was thinking, oh shit, what did I just do? I thought that was funny at the time, so I took a screenshot of that conversation and I posted that to Facebook and she sees that photo of the screenshot explaining what STFU means and she thinks it's like this tip of a cap to our love. Like I was shouting it from the Facebook rooftops. And she comments on that photo, obviously, Douglas, my angel, my only son, exo, exo, caps lock, STFU. That comment got like 85 likes, more than the original picture I posted. And the best part is she's been texting that to all my family members, you know? My aunt's like, you know what your mom told me to shut the fuck up when she invited me to the Christmas party. Nobody likes you, my daddy, so shut the fuck up, alright? My 87 year old grandma is way more tech savvy than my mom. I was just visiting her last year in California and she has Parkinson's, right? So she can't really move that well anymore. And she used to love going to church on Sundays, but now she just watches her Sunday mass on YouTube. And she has this little like smart remote that she pushes this button and she talks into it and whatever she says pops up on YouTube. So after her mass, what she would do is she would like YouTube a world city she's never been to and do like a walk through tour of the world city so she can feel like she's traveling there, right? It's adorable. And she's like, Douglas, where do you want to travel to today? And I was like, I don't know, Mimi, how about Lisbon Portugal? I've always wanted to go to Lisbon, Portugal. And she's like, okay, beep, Lisbon, Portugal. And then I go to the bathroom. I come back five minutes later. She's watching Lesbians in Portugal. And I think she was into it, honestly, a little bit. She was like, Douglas, is this where you want to go? I'm like, actually, yeah. Let's just stay away from Bangkok for a little while, Mimi, okay? Just pump the brakes on Bangkok. Yeah, she was like my maternal figure going up because like I said, both my parents drank. My dad was a different type of alcohol. My dad was like, fun drunk dad, you know? Like I used to go over his house in the weekends. I'd eat ice cream sundaes for dinner and watch girls going wild in foam urchelles. And it was great, you know? But then I got older and I started to see like how bad his alcoholism really was, you know? He was like a survivalist alcoholic, right? Like for example, if he didn't have enough alcohol in the house to get drunk with, he wouldn't drink it. He would consider it a waste, right? That's a whole nother level. When you can drink like an Irish pirate, but you have the patience of a Buddhist monk, you know? I was like, Dad, you got two beers right there. He just turns, he's like, son, that's not enough. Now he's sober though. He's sober. He's 13 years sober. I'm very proud of him. Yeah, thanks. I still drink, but that's fine. Thank you on his behalf. Yeah, he's in. My dad's in the AA program now and he's in AA and he's obsessed with going to meetings. He loves the AA meetings. He actually met his new girlfriend in AA and for sentimental reasons, he said he wants to propose to her and have the wedding in the church where they first shared their first AA meeting. So I thought it'd be adorable if the whole wedding was just AA themed, you know? Everyone wears, hello, my name is stickers. I sit in a room kind of like this, same energy right now and when the bride walks down the aisle, she only has to take the 12 steps to get there. I thought that would be appropriate, right? At the altar, they don't have rings. They just exchange little chips, you know? Let's say like 10 years, tops, or instead of I do, they say one day at a time. At the reception, right? I'm his best man, so I have to do the best man speech. But there's not going to be any champagne glasses at alcoholics and on him is wedding. So I have to do the toast, how am I supposed to get everyone's attention? I have to like find like a, you know, clink a plastic butter knife against a styrofoam coffee cup or something, right? Hi everyone, my name is Doug and I'm the best man. Hi Doug. I'd like to make a toast to my father, a man who didn't have much money growing up but still had enough money to teach me how to make a white Russian with straight vodka and powdered coffee creamer. A bloody marry with rubbing alcohol and ketchup packets. A man who taught me how to open my first beer bottle with a bottle opener that's on a key chain while it's still in his ignition. Stick around for the cutting of the wedding cake which is just made up of a bunch of still donuts over there on an unclothed fold-out table. Hey DJ, spin the serenity prayer son. All right, you're all invited. You're all invited. Well look, I'm no saint, you know, I drink, I know it's in my blood, it's red it's hairy, I gotta go easy. Sometimes you drink, you know, we can all like have a few drinks and it's fine and keep it under control but sometimes, you know, either signs that you gotta cut back, you know. Few years ago I went to a fourth of July cook out and after this cook out there was a bowl of Long Island iced tea, a bowl, yeah. And I drank roughly it and later on in the evening it was getting late and there was some mosquitoes out and there was some kids running around and I thought I was doing something responsible so I grabbed a bottle of bug spray and I started spraying all these kids with bug spray, right, to protect them from whatever the mosquitoes were carrying. I thought I was doing something nice. One of the moms comes running up to me, she's like, what the hell do you think you're doing? And she slaps the can out of my hand, it turns out it was a kind of raid, yeah. I was like it looked like it can't hold off, I'm sorry, I thought I was off. It was yard guard, it was the stuff you spray in the yard. Strong enough to keep the insects from Jumanji away. She was pissed, she's like you just sprayed my kid on the face with raid, I was like whoa, whoa, whoa. I just sprayed all the kids on the face with raid. Nobody got left out of this raid parade. She's like are you gonna call poison control because that stuff is deadly. I was like I think you need to calm down. Because it's getting late and now the mosquitoes are biting and now we're out of yard guard. I think what we should do is just lay all the kids around the perimeter of the yard to protect the adults. And I got kicked out of that cook out immediately and received my very first public urination violation. Thank you. So my case was dismissed. I don't know if you guys know this public urination only a crime for the indecent exposure, not the act of urinating. Oh, Dougie boy over here, be the system by publicly peeing in the privacy of my own pants. So yeah, you can win and lose your dignity at the same time. If a cop comes up to you behind a dumpster somewhere and he's like what are you doing over there? You could be like oh, bang the law officer. Just point to your soiled crotch. This isn't public urination. This is private urination. This is a private pants peeing party at party, pooping parade patrol officer. I literate very well when I'm drunk. Yeah, I woke up the next day. That was a rough day because I was like my allergies were kicked in and like I was taking all these allergy medicine, right? Next day woke up and I told my friend I was like dude, I blacked out. I don't know what happened last night. I think I got drugged. I was like honestly think I got drugged. He's like yeah, you're drinking a whole bowl of long iced tea and two cleared and d's. You drugged yourself. I was like well, we don't need to point fingers here. Okay. This is a cold case. This is law and order cold and flu. All right. I think I'd be a good dad though. There's this children's secondhand store in Rhode Island. I think they're elsewhere too. Maybe you guys have seen it. Very whimsical name. Very creepy name. It's called Once Upon a Child. I don't know who's in charge of their marketing team but whoa, okay. Once upon a child does not sound like a clothing store for children. Okay. That sounds like a rehab center for pedophiles. Hi my name's Frank and I was once upon a child. Hi Frank. Went to Walmart recently to buy a gift and I went to the bathroom. I had to go to the bathroom when I was in this Walmart and it was a very low point in my life and I had to go to the bathroom. The bathroom in Walmart is in the back and you're like the board game section and I noticed something very interesting when I entered the restroom on either side of the restroom entrance who was like two displays of photographs. On one side was all the Walmart employees of the month. On the other side was a bunch of missing person posters. Which is like the saddest game of would you rather ever, right? Because some of those missing people could be alive and well and the Bahamas somewhere. But those other people are definitely still the employee of the month of Walmart. Look I'm not making fun of missing people. Obviously I'm making fun of the wall near the bathroom at Walmart. That's a weird placement. There was like 35 missing people on this wall. I just went in there for a gift. That's a lot of pressure on me as a Walmart patron. That's a lot of people just to keep an eye out for. You know what I mean? There's a lot of information on all those posters too. It's a lot. You have ever jotted down the information either. So don't pretend like you're better than me. It's like they're height and they're weight and they're eye color and the hair color and then the missing sense date. What does that do for me? All that did was maybe stand there and look for the oldest missing sense date. It was a bottle of wine or something. I don't know. And I was impressed. I was like, ooh, 2009. Those are tough to find. Yeah. Not usually full body, but... I was in Walmart. I was getting a gift from my niece. She's 10 years old and she's obsessed with the movie Annie, Little Red Headed Orphan Annie. And for a birthday, I wanted to give her the DVD of Annie so she could have like a present to unwrap. So I went to the electronic section of Walmart to look for the movie and this very nice sales associate. This black woman comes up to me. This is important for the story. She goes, can I help you, honey? I'm like, yes, I'm looking for the movie Annie on DVD. Do you have that? And she's like, well, which one do you want? I said, what do you mean? She said, well, we have the original version of Annie or the remake with the black Annie. I left with two copies of Annie, everybody. I was like, she loves every Annie. All Annie's matter to her. So I bought two Jamie Foxx versions. I would have bought more, but that's all they had. Guys, the black guy liked the joke. You can loosen up your body holes a little bit, okay? Thank you, sir. I like movies. You guys like movies? I like horror movies. You guys like scary movies? Yeah. I love scary movies. But in my 30s, I watch scary movies now and they just hit different. They're not as believable, right? I just rewatched this movie I used to love. It's called Cabin in the Woods. If you've never seen Cabin in the Woods, let me explain. It's about five friends that go on a weekend camping trip to a cabin. Oh, thank you. The spoiler alert, they're all murdered at the end. They're all murdered by a bunch of robots, zombies, a giant squid monster, and ghosts. By then in the movie, I was like, yeah, right. There's no way that five friends have the same weekend off in this economy. I don't... How the hell get the time approved off? That's... How they got a babysitter? Because that's my real life horror movie. Is renting an Airbnb cabin in the Woods for five of my friends, pulling it all on my credit card, and then nobody shows up. That's terrifying. These are all problems that you have in your 30s. There's all the things that go through your head, you know? Like I just had a birthday recently, and one of my friends was like, hey, Doug, what'd you do for your birthday? You got turned up? You got turned? Did you turn up? You get turned? I'm like, no. I don't get turned up, okay? I get tired. I'm get tired. I'm so tired. I don't get turned, okay? Maybe a second wind. Maybe I got a second wind. After a nap, I don't get turned, though. You want to know what I did for my birthday? I turned off my bedroom light. I have asthma. I was feeling weasy, so I turned on my nebulizer machine because I just turned 35 years old. That's what I did. Yeah, turned down for what? The night. I'm going to turn down for the night, I think. Oh, right. I realize recently, life is all about finding moments of joy every day. And maybe your joy is seeing your dog when you come home from work. Maybe your version of joy is like seeing your kids get off the school bus in the afternoon, or if you hate your kids, seeing them get on the school bus and drive away. But I don't have kids or pets. So my version of joy looks different. Like recently, I just found the back to my TV remote, that little plastic piece. And let me tell you, pure joy, everybody. You know what I'm feeling of being like, I have been holding onto those batteries for so long. When I was younger, my joy was collecting action figures. And now I'm in my 30s, and I'm collecting essential oils all of a sudden. What am I doing? Also, why are they essential? They're not essential oil. They don't need them to live. You know what's an essential oil? That's an essential oil. If my car runs out of motor oil, like, combusting the flames, if I run out of lavender, I can't wind down at night, you know? As a difference. I'm so bad with my motor. I never check my oil. I never check it. I'm so bad with cars. All my friends are like, gear heads. They're all motor heads. They'll talk about their cars. I'm always stuck in that car conversation where everyone goes around and talks about their car and what they did to it. And then it gets to me and I have to contribute to this conversation now. They're like, yo, Doug, what's your role in it? I'm like, what am I rolling in? That's a 2001 Mitsubishi Galant 4-door. Rolley-downy windows. It's got those. Silver? No, Doug, what's your going on with the hood? Oh, onto the hood, you ask. I'm sorry. Let me just find the mechanism here to open that. Oh, here it is. Can you hold that for me? Thanks. I lost the swingy thingy. Yeah, no. Nothing fancy. Everything's pretty stock except that bird's nest. Just got that installed. Oh, the oil on my dipstick hits that little notch so I'm good for like two years or so, I think. Nobody ever taught me about cars. My mom raised me by herself pretty much. So she was just like her version of like mechanic help was like, Douglas, did you check your fluids? Did you check your fluids? I didn't know what the fluids are. She's like, did you check your fluids? Mom, my car's on fire. Well, you should have checked your fluids, Douglas. I'm telling you. My mom is, she's a year sober now, proud of her. Yeah. Because a judge told her she had to be where she would go back to jail. Yeah. That's right. So my mom had to do some time. She had to go to the clink for like 30 days. You know, she made a mistake. I don't want to say what she went to jail for, but let's just say she likes to drive. And she didn't check her fluids. Too many fluids, honestly. When you're a comedian and your mother goes to jail, it is hilarious, okay? Because when you get a call from somebody from jail, it's not them that calls you like, hey, what's going on, right? When you get a call from somebody in prison, it's like an automated system you have to go through before you talk to your friend or your relative or whatever. So when I got the call, it was like, hello, this is the Rhode Island Correctional Center. You're receiving a call from an inmate by the name of Doug. It's not to accept this call. Press nine. To deny, press three. I was like three. I don't need that right now. She had one second record her name. She chose to have a full blown panic attack. But that story has a happy ending. She's in a gang now. So it's fine. That's not really gang. It's a group. It's a Facebook group. She started in there. And now every time she called, like she knew I wasn't going to answer. So she would just like tell me what she needed in that little one second window, right? Maybe like you were receiving a call from an inmate by the name of me, my vitamins. Got to take your vitamins. I've been taking my vitamins and trying to be healthier. It's insane what we put on our bodies thinking it's healthy. Think about 200 years ago, people thought they were doing things that were healthy and now they're bad. Think about medical technology. 200 years ago, doctors were treating people with forms of medicine. They thought were top of the line back then. We looked back and we think they're still now. 200 years ago, doctors were treating people by performing leaching and bloodletting. Bloodletting. Even when somebody died on the operating table from the bloodletting, the doctors were still like, I don't know what happened. We let out like so much blood and he still died. We let out like all of his blood. This is a medical mystery. I'm boggled, frankly. I am the best bloodletter on this side of the Mississippi. That's going to be the case in like 200 years from now. Things we do and eat now might turn out to be bad for us and kill us in the future. In those future people are going to make fun of us. We're like, can you believe those idiots back in the 2000s didn't know that kale caused cancer? Yeah. That's why we now spell cancer with a K after the great kale cleanse of 2075. Wipe through it clean of those pretentious assholes. Any married people here? All right, relax. Sorry, you're not that happy. Don't bullshit me. That's fine. If you're married, you're happily married. That's great. But you know, just shut up about it. Just be quietly in love and don't talk about it. There's another pandemic going on online. It's called the Wedding Day countdown photos and these people need to die, okay? You know what I'm talking? Every time you go on social media on Instagram, it's like 572 days until I get to marry my best friend. It's like, that's more than a year, Lauren. We don't need that. 245 days, 110 days until I get to marry my... Even the people going to the wedding don't give a shit about those posts. They look at those countdown photos like it's the tax deadline. They're like, oh shit, that's next week. I don't have the money for that right now. And then finally, the Wedding Day arrives. You're like, thank God I don't have to see those Wedding Day countdown photos anymore. And then seven days later, it's like, happy one week anniversary to my best friend. And you're like, we're going up now. Remember when you're a kid in school, you find out there's negative numbers. You're like, there's more of these things. Like forever. That's all right. Dating now. Anybody, any single guys here? Single guys on the dating scene? Yeah. Are you on the dating apps? Yeah, that's okay. Everyone's on a date. This is how conditioned dating apps have made our brains. I'll see a pretty girl on the street at a bar or something. And I'll just think like, man, really hopes she pops up in my dating app. Instead of just saying hello, do you put what you're looking for? What do you put that you're looking for? What are your goals? No, well women, yeah, that's valid answer. That was a very vague question. Very progressive answer. I meant like your relationship goals, but a long-term relationship and you're genuinely looking for a long-term relationship, he's lying. Right now, he's lying. Which one are you on? You're on all of them. Yeah, just diversify your portfolio, man. That's good. Do you put your goals, your dating goals on there? You do. What do you put that you're looking for? Short-term long-term? That's two different things. I'm very serious, but I just want to fuck. At the same time. That's good, that's honest. You're honest, you're an honest, man. One of my friends, he's on dating apps and he puts that he's looking for a life partner. No. I know damn well he's not. He just told me that you have to put that or women won't entertain the conversation if they don't think you're serious. He had the audacity to complain to me that women use too many filters on their photos on dating apps. I was like, well, you're doing the same thing, buddy. Women might use filters on their photos. You're using filters over your intentions. Which is more deceptive, really. She might be using Valencia. You're using fucking sociopathia. She might be trying to hide a few blemishes. You're hiding years of unpack trauma that you haven't worked out yet. She might have the Snapchat dog filter, but you are the dog, buddy. You're a dogfish. You're dogfishing her. What's that dogfish? It should be an app, right? I had a bad date not too long ago. Very bad date. Very awkward. I want to date with one of these astrology cooks. If you're a little bit into astrology, that's fine. With this girl on the date, she brought on the first date. She brought tarot cards and energy crystals out of her purse on the first date. I'm all about laying the cards out, but not like this. One of these girls wanted to know everything about my birthday. She wanted to, like, the month I was born, the day of the week I was born, the time I was born. She was obsessed with the time. Right. She's like, what time are you born? I was like, I don't know. She's like, you don't know what time you were born? I was like, if you give me a minute, I can give you an estimated time that my uber will arrive. How about that? I was amazed she could read my birth chart, but not my body language, you know? She was like, you don't know what time you were born? I was like, it's probably on my birth certificate. She's like, well, where is that? I was like, it's how my mom's house. Okay? My mom keeps the birth certificate. All right. I needed a recent link called her. I'm like, do you know my birth certificate? She went like this, my mom. She went, Douglas, I kept the staples from the C section. Of course, I have your birth certificate. I was like, I didn't need to know that. She's like, why? It's in your baby box. I'm like, those came from your baby box. I don't need to know that. So I told this woman on the date that my birth certificate was on my mom's house. I was like, what do you want me to call my mom right now? I ask her what time I was born. And she went like this. Typical guy, such a child. I was like, I'm the child? You brought picture cards and rocks. And I'm the child. Okay. First of all, I find it so hard to believe that the alignment of the stars when you're born dictates your whole personality. Like, who you are is an individual. You know, like she's like, well, I'm a Libra. I'm a lucky Libra. Everything usually works out for me because I'm a lucky Libra. I'm like, no, you ever think that maybe everything works out for you, not because you're a lucky Libra. But maybe you were just born underneath the entitled white top moon. How about that? Maybe it was the way you were raised. I was like, how is this day going so far? Is it going well? What are the cards showing? What are the rocks saying? And she goes, I don't know. We're giving off bisexual preference energy. Bisexual preference energy. I was like, do you think that I'm attracted to men? And she goes, no, I think you're only attracted to women who are also attracted to other women. And I was like, how dare you nail day? Good for you. Nail on the head. I am an ally. An ally I want to do is see you make out with her right now. Go. It was awkward at that point. I was like, so do you want kids? And she went like this when I asked her if she wanted kids. She went, if you must know, I'm freezing my eggs. I was like, OK, I'm sorry. I want to have kids two one day. I don't know a lot about freezing eggs. What is that in tail? She was like, first, it cost $1,000 to harvest the eggs from my ovaries. And she was talking about the money. I didn't even ask how much of the stuff cost. She's like, then it costs $400 a month to keep them frozen. And I'm like, I'm pretty sure you can get a climate controlled storage unit for $100 a month with a free month. And she did not find that funny. And I was just joking. And I was like, well, you do all right. So dinner's on you tonight, right? And she goes like, that's just like, excuse me? No, dinner's on you. I'm a strong, independent woman with a good job. I don't need a man to support me financially. But I still think you should show me a little chivalry. I was like, I think those eggs were already ice cold before they were frozen. So I think they're going to be pretty chilly in there a little while longer. So bundle up eggs. But that's what it's like, Dave. You meet a lot of the wrong people before you find the one right person. You know what I mean? You know? Like my ex-girlfriend. We dated for three years, right? And towards the end of our relationship, she asked me the dreaded question. And I don't know if anybody has had this conversation. It's very uncomfortable. She goes, what's your body count? I didn't know this was a term. Did anybody know this was a term? Yeah. What does body count mean? How many people have these levels? It means how many people you've slept with, right? I didn't know that. OK. When I was growing up with 90s rap, your body count was how many people you've murdered. How many tear drop tattoos you have? Now body count means how many people you've slept with, indicated by how many lower back tattoos you have. And she asked me that. And I was like, didn't know how to respond. I was like, I don't know. I don't keep track. You know? I was like, why? Do you know your body count? How many people you've been with? And she went like this. She went, yeah. Obviously, I keep a list on my phone. I don't know what to talk. She said, I keep a list. And I have a list. That implies it could be ongoing. OK. I didn't know if this was the thing. She's like, some gals keep a list on their phone and their notes app. I didn't know that. And now I wanted to see this list. Psychologically, that messed with me. Now I want to see the list. I want to see how many names are on it. I want to see the people. I want to make sure that I'm the last name on that list. Right? And then I asked to see the list. And that was a bad idea. That made it worse. I shouldn't have done that. Don't do that. Because in my head, I thought it was going to be this professional spreadsheet list with like emergency contact information. No, it was not. It was like names and ratings. Yeah, I didn't expect that. It was like Jeremy Hott tub 9.5. Eric Eggplant emoji 8.3. And then me, Doug, that's it. No fun name. No rating. No emoji. You know what sad it is? Is he the name Doug at the bottom of a sex list? It's very sad. It made me insecure, you know? And the girl I was with, my girlfriend at the time, she was very insecure as well. She actually suffered from body dysmorphia, which is when you have a distorted self-image of your own face or body. She was a beautiful woman, but when she looked in the mirror, she didn't see the same beautiful person I saw. She saw like an ugly person. And that concerned me, because typically people date in the same league of attractiveness as each other. So I was like, well, shit, if she thinks she's a four, what does that make me, you know? So then I developed body dysmorphia also. And now I'm trying to keep us both out of four, so she doesn't leave me. She's like, when I look in the mirror, I see dark spots, a crooked nose, weird eyes. I feel crazy. I'm like, babe, you're not crazy. I see those things too, OK? And you forgot about dry skin. I love you so much. Please don't leave me. She was very insecure about her feminine region. Like, she wouldn't let me see it if it wasn't groomed, if you will. And like, I don't discriminate. You can shave, grow, full bush, whatever you want. But she wouldn't let me see it if it wasn't waxed. So one night I was like, hey, are we going to, you know? And she was like, nope, nope, not tonight. I haven't gotten waxed yet. I was like, well, I thought you just had a waxing appointment the other day. And she was like, well, I did. I went. And the girl told me that it wasn't ready yet. What? Some of the girls are laughing because they know what I'm talking about. Apparently, the hair has to be a certain length before they can wax it. I didn't know that. So when she told me she was like, it wasn't ready yet. I was like, is there a pubic hair groundhog that they bring out? Like, waxed a Tony Phil sauce five o'clock pubic hair shadow. Looks like it's going to be two more weeks of pubes, buddy. Sorry. So out of solidarity, I went to go get waxed with her as well. And as soon as I walked in, I was like, is it long enough? She's like, yes. And no, I'm like, wait, what are you talking about? Which one? Wait a second. OK. All right. She had a weird sensory sensitivity, my ex. She hated the texture of certain substances because she thought they were gross. Like, she hated the texture of lube, right? Lube. She hated the feel of lube. I don't know why. She just thought it was gross. And look, lube is a good thing. We need it sometimes. It enhances the experience, right? Maybe the mood's not right. Maybe the temperature's off. Maybe you're dehydrated. You know? Sometimes you need it. You for a cotton mouth? I don't know. It's got to have a name, cotton clam. I don't know what it's called. Does it have a name? It gets drier than the desert cactus snatch, I call it, from time to time. Yeah, cactus. You got cactus snatch because you didn't laugh hard enough a cottoncoach. That was a punishment. Guy and clam, whatever I said. I just suggested we use more lube. Just to enhance the experience. And she got all defensive. She's like, ew, no, that's gross. I don't want to use more lube. That's disgusting. That's gross. What's wrong with mine? She's like, what's wrong with my natural lube? What's wrong with my natural lube? What does it feel like? She's like, what does it feel like to you? And I panicked. I was like, you want to know what it feels like? It's like driving with the windshield wipers on when it's not raining. LAUGHTER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER I can't keep spitting on my windshield, honey, okay? That's... LAUGHTER That's why windshield wiper fluid was invented. You got to check your fluids. You know what I mean? You got to check your fluids. APPLAUSE LAUGHTER See, that's the joke that keeps on giving. Because you guys might get in your car tonight. LAUGHTER Maybe a year from now. LAUGHTER You're going to turn your windshield wipers on when it's not raining. And you're going to think of a drive of a China, so you're welcome, Providence. LAUGHTER My name is Doug Keith. Thank you so much. CHEERING CHEERING Thank you. CHEERING You're welcome, Providence. CHEERING APPLAUSE BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER You can also remember that joke by buying one of these sweet, check your fluids t-shirts right here. CHEERING All right. They make great gifts for the kids during the holidays. They don't know what it means. It's a good reminder to check your fluids and all the proceeds go towards my mother's future bail fund. So... CHEERING CHEERING CHEERING MUSIC

So I'm eating them all fucks, one of the times I try to save them all fucks, right? She come and tell me, what you're doin'? I'm like, I'm saving these motherfuckers. She's like, shit, you gotta share them with the rope. All right. Damn. These smaller fuckers then. My thin brother had me standing over, fucked up whole 10. Room was smaller than my fucking... Room was so damn small, they didn't need no mocha control, right? Because you can turn everything on and off with your feet and shit. I'm laying in the bed, clicking channels and shit, you know, turn on my fucking shy. I'm like, damn. Then this shit had roaches in. Roaches in the whole dead. Bullshit, I came in late one night shit. The rope sitting on my bed in the bathroom was smoking a cigarette. Tell me what you got some messages. What the fuck is you, man? Fuck that. So I'm making money now so I can get my own shit. I'm telling y'all. I got to worry about no girl in the house because women, y'all. Women, y'all fucks, damn. It's women out here. I got to give to y'all, y'all. Women, y'all, they only live in beans on the face of this earth. They can be broke as a motherfucking steel kickin'. For real, cause I can be sittin' in home broke. Cause you know it's gonna be some old lollipop sucker to see roe motherfuckers. It's gonna set you ass up. Alright, one piece at home, tell me what's up.

I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all.
The of the of ten Please welcome to the bring now, Mr. Hant, great! Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being here. All right, how's this, huh? One more top of the green mill everybody, this place is fantastic. What an honor to be doing this at the green mill. Whoever said stand up couldn't be cool was right. But they did not know that I would be shooting a special at the green mill and calling it Top Gun 3. It's good to see you guys, good to be out, good to share your biology again, huh? It was a while, it was a long couple years there. I handled COVID like I always handled herpes. A tested negative. And there's just no way that's right. There's no way. There's no way that's right, just based on where I've been. I'm going to say those are false negatives. I'll tell you this though, if the vaccine was for herpes we wouldn't be fighting like this as a country. Nobody would be dragging their heels on the herpes vaccine. 0.0 US Americans are not getting the herpes vaccine. Chicago, nobody's walking off the job because they didn't want to get the herpes vaccine. No firefighters are trading their pensions for cold source guys. That's what I'm trying to say. No truck drivers are clogging up a bridge because they're mad about the herpes vaccine mandate. I don't know if you guys know any truck drivers but they're going to be the first ones to get the herpes vaccine. 10.4 good buddy, I'll take 10 more for all my favorite ladies at the gasoline yard. So them guys can get back to work. Oh, that's good. I'm good. Right before the pandemic I got my identity theft. The taken. Stolen. Married is what I'm married. I got married. Come on, she's a wonderful woman. How would you confuse those two things? It felt like a bit of a smashing grab. I gotta be honest. Everything I thought I knew gone in an instant. No, she's wonderful. She's a better person than me, my wife. That's a risk. Being with a better person than you, you know what I'm talking about. Because now it's in my head every day I wake up, maybe she just did this because I look like I needed help. I don't need that kind of doubt in my life. I don't need that kind of doubt in my life. Do I got a sandbag this? If I get functional does she move on to the next town? Like Bruce Banner? Save some other elderly fuck boy. I don't want to disappoint her but I can't have her thinking her work here is done. Every once in a while I suggest we get a roommate. Just to keep runner toes. Now you guys, I'm sorry, I do have to kind of got a power through this tonight. I finally got my booster shot and now I can't feel my freedom. Thank you. I'm serious. Right when the needle hit my skin. Right when the needle hit my skin I can feel my pocket constitution burst into flames. Right there in my banana republic cargo pants. I had to get a new set of cargo pants. I lost a perfectly good pair of outlet mall tactical cargo pants to that damn booster shot. Right when the science was soaking into my loins I could feel my musket slip out of my hands. Right there into the Potomac. I went from Walgreens to the Potomac to apologize to the ghost of George Washington. And he wouldn't look me in my eyes and I panicked and I dropped my musket and floated to the bottom where Rachel Maddow was waiting. With her bony little mad al fingers and she caught my musket and she kept it. Not cool science. Not cool. Not good job science. Proud of you. But people aren't impressed by science anymore. They're not impressed. Start throwing curveball science. Give them something to look at. Here you go science, when you impress me give a pig a person heart. Just one time science. You never even thought about that. We're constantly giving people pig hearts. What do they do? They lay around, they sleep and eat, they do a bunch of pig stuff. Yeah, it's boring. It's boring. Just one time make me a pig and do some people stuff science. One time make me a pig that can join a climbing gym or make me a pig I can enjoy a rom-com with. Science. Guys, don't worry. My wife is a nurse which makes me a doctor. And... It's been a good year. It's been a good year to be a brand new doctor. Because I mean now more than ever we need real medical professionals. Now more than ever, half the country got PhDs on YouTube last year. So I'll fight that fight. Somebody said some nonsense to me. I'll look them straight in the face. I'll stack some shit I halfway listened to. Right up on top of something else I changed a channel before they were done explaining it. I'll push it right across the bar, if they're asked. Call it research. You gotta call it research. That way they know you didn't read it. Don't like it when you read some shit. That calls into question. They're work ethic and the whole conversation is lost. I'll call it research to their mother fucking face and then they know they're dealing with a medical professional. I hope everybody's okay. I hope everybody's okay. Did anybody else lose a family member to QAnon? The real pandemic? My name's Nate. I'm from Wisconsin. I was born in Indiana through a tire swing. So this QAnon shit is affecting me directly. If you don't know what QAnon is, it's a video game that hillbillies get to live inside of. And I was not prepared. I had never lost a cousin to Super Mario Brothers before. What it is, that's what it is. It's a, it's Super Mario Brothers. If the princess were supposed to save is my cousin's wife. Mandy. Tell me more Mandy. Everything I know about QAnon. I know from Mandy's Instagram story. I guess, I guess that the Democratic Party and the Hollywood elite, which I am one of, are running a baby huffing dungeon where they huff the steam off of babies. That's how they get their power. That's why Nancy Pelosi's dentures look like they're going to eat her own face every morning. Just snorting at hot, hot baby steam. Also, maybe in just real quick, in defense of baby huffing, is some of the country not huffing babies? It's one of the finest things in life. I mean, I don't even have kids. I just, any chance I get to huff a baby I'm doing it. And I would just recommend it. Maybe you'd calm down a little bit, but anyway. No, I will say this though. I think the pandemic was hardest on the whites. Because we already wanted to talk to the manager. We already wanted to talk to the manager. And now everybody wanted to talk to the manager. That line used to be all ours. And now we had to do it through a mask. Obviously, we had to do it through a mask. We had to explain the constitution. We had to pretend that we read the constitution. Through a mask. While destroying a beachwear display. To somebody that might not be the manager. I mean, we'll do it. We did it. And we'll do it again. If that's what we have to do. If that's what we have to do to protect against the things that are founding fathers warned us against. We will leave no self-checkout screen unslabbered upon. So that we can explain personal sovereignty to somebody that just smoked weed in a loading dock. That is what my people will do for you. You ever even thought about that? Others? Nobody wants to work anymore. I want everyone's fire. I want everyone associated with this decision. Fire! It's easy, asshole. Nobody wants to work anymore. Nobody wants to help you. Just don't be the biggest asshole at Bevmo. And you're good. You want people to help you just be in line in front of that guy. And they'll do everything that you need. It's a good person. They'll carry your plastic vodka bottles to your Rev 4 for you, buddy. I want everyone fired. Nobody wants to work. That Kim Kardashian told me that on Instagram. Nobody wants to work anymore. Nobody wants to work. Give back to work. Thanks, Kim. Really appreciate it. Wrong messenger. You know what I mean? Wrong messenger. Thank you, Kim. What happened, Kim? Did nobody help you at the implant warehouse? Do you have any more opinions? You can help us through this. The current landscape of corporate servitude, Kim. What are your opinions on Automization, Kim? I would bet the middle third of my dick. That Kim Kardashian never changed a vacuum bag. Get in there, Kim. Fight the good fight. Let us know your thoughts on mechanization when you get a shot. Thanks very much for coming out. Especially parents. You did the heavy lifting in that pandemic. You really did. I appreciate you. I don't know. Anybody else without kids? Did you guys call your friends with kids during the pandemic? Oh man. Just chaos. It was chaos. My buddy Ari. He was a stay-at-home dad during the pandemic. He's got a three-year-old and a five-year-old. I would call him and just every call sounded like he'd called 911 and dropped the phone. He would answer, too, right? Because he was all day for him. He's like, oh, dude, dude. What's up? Dude, hold on. Are you bleeding? What's going on? What's happening? Sadie. No. Sadie. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no No, no, no, no, no, no, no hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on my neck. Let me hug you. No, no, hold on my neck. Oh baby, my neck. Oh baby, my neck. My neck. Oh baby, my neck. And Tisou, hold on, dude, I got, bro, I got cheers, I don't know being bike cheers, there's cheers, and every car I got. Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, wait for your brother, Sadie, twin brother, Sandad laughs and I got to call you back. He could drop the phone in his minivan. I'd be in my garage with no responsibilities. Just like, oh my God. Smoking weed, like what's gonna happen to say to you? Tune in next week to see if say to get Sir Juice. Oh. I think I'd be a good dad. It's almost hurtful. I'm a good person. I know it's not something a good person has to say. My worst fear is getting a kid stuck in a ceiling fan. You ever do that? You're a tall guy. You never jam a kid up in a ceiling fan? Never once? What do you got? That nice high-lofted ceilings in your condo that you own? It's convenient. Nobody ever rents their ceiling fans anymore. I'm the only one. I'm the only one with six-foot-five-inch ceiling fans. It's just perfect. There he is. My boy. Lewis, not even born yet. It's already got a 16-inch scar above his left eye. I think I'm a good person. Get a kid stuck in a ceiling fan. That's a bad time to find out you're not a good person. I just don't... I think I'll adopt. Get like a 16-year-old. Yeah. You agree with me. It's a good strategy. Get him across a finish line real quick. Pick one with a scholarship. You laugh because it's a foolproof plan. I just don't ever want to have to get an infant through an airport. That looks like rock bottom. You ever see two adults at the airport just getting laughed? By one little organ grinder monkey off its leash. Grab and snacks and harassing federal agents. They're just tangled up in charger cables with no words left, getting a divorce and silence. Just... Fighting over whose turn it is and silence. You ever see an actually outnumbered adult at the airport? That's rock bottom. So I'm mom trying to get three kids through security. She just... Quit in her eyes. It's a dead look in her eyes. She was just... She was kicking shit. She was... Challenging TSA agent. She looked like she wanted to get arrested. She was like, huh? Kicking a bear through the swiper, man. You can't... Like, huh? What? Who? What? These? Yeah. They're mine. This one's got a bomb in her, huh? He's got a gun. She's got a bomb. I'm gonna go somewhere to a room with a couch. Take me to that? Yeah, I'll go. Take me to the room with a couch, where I can close my eyes for the first time in 18 calendar months. I think I'll go to the couch room now, huh? Plusy, how about the couch room? No, I did not pack my own bags. Two brown men, I didn't recognize that. Couch room now? Couch room now? My wife says I'm not nice. Fine. A good person. It can't be both. It's disgusting. She's your good person, doesn't mean you have to be nice. And just because you're nice does not mean you're a good person. The rudest thing anybody ever said to me was, I'll pray for you. Which is a very nice thing to say to someone. If you know they believe what you believe. But if they don't believe what you believe, I'll pray for you. It's a motherfucking threat. I'll pray for you. I'm gonna pray for you. I pray that's okay. Don't worry about that. No, I'll pray for you. No, I'm gonna pray for you. I mean, it's not gonna work. You're gonna be downstairs. You're gonna be bound up. Some sort of trapped in. Some sort of haunt. You're gonna haunt some building someday. You're gonna be in hell for eternity. You're gonna not like your life. You're the eternity that was chosen for you based on your behavior and your demon-like tentations. It's gonna be a bad situation. I'm gonna be upstairs. I'm gonna be up in a different place than you. But I'll pray for you. I'm gonna be getting a foot rub and having by whatever slaves they have up there. But I'll pray for you. No thanks. I got kicked out of Sunday school. No, the rudest thing anybody ever said to me is somebody told me I had resting bitch face. First of all, maybe we take it easy on our bitches. They're resting. How would you like it if every time you tried to take a nap somebody compared you to unhappy people? Also, why are you so familiar with what resting bitches look like? You be spying on bitches? Maybe these bitches should be worried about what you look like. Maybe these bitches should be describing nap time creep face to the authorities. I did get kicked out of Sunday school. That should sound my resume. I grew up in a cathedral. I was just there. My dad was a... I did not sleep there. My dad was the choir director at St. Rayfield's cathedral where I'm from. It's St. Raphael's. But if you're... If you're from Wisconsin, I just found this out. I just realized this. I just realized that it was only because we were in Wisconsin that we pronounced it Rayfield's. I'm sorry. Did you mean Raymond Fields? Yeah, Rayfield. Yeah, like it's a sports bar. Come on down to Rayfield's. Two for ones on Admonishments this week. Free drinks, not just on Sundays anymore. Come on down, Rayfield's. Why watch the game when you can be where it's decided? The good guys always win at Rayfield's. St. Raphael's. And my dad was cheap. He just wanted a free babysitter. He sent me to... He sent me to... Weekday Sunday School. Anybody go to Weekday Sunday School? That's next level Sunday School, if you don't know. If you don't know, if you didn't grow up in a cathedral, under every cathedral, there's a bomb shelter where there's about half a dozen pasty white children with bug-eyed and a couple of nuns telling them about the world. And it's... About... It's a pretty close to a baby huff and dungeon. If you... I mean, it's down in there. It's, you know, it's kind of airtight. You can smell those kids. They're down there. Just learning the same book over and over. And I was seven. I was a prick kid. I didn't have time for this shit. I had just started wondering if Trees Head Souls. I had started wondering what I wanted to believe in in the world. But I wasn't... They throw the book at you. They throw the book at you. And then they dangle Santa Claus, and I didn't like that. I felt like a threat. And I walked in there. My dad was like, quite I didn't need to be there. I walked in like Drake, dude. No new friends. What are you gonna tell me? And the nuns hated me right away. They didn't like me. I'm still open to anything. I'll believe in anything if it's convenient. Anything at all. I wasn't opposed. I definitely didn't know God existed, but I didn't know He didn't. I wasn't sure in any direction. And I'm still not. I don't... Astrology. This is a good example. I don't believe in astrology. Unless somebody doesn't like me. And then I only believe in astrology. What? She said, what? She said, what? What month was she born in? Of course she was born in November. Astrology is a great religion if you need to explain why people don't like you. Christianity is a great religion if you need to explain why you don't like people. And I don't know. I just didn't like... I didn't get... We didn't hit it off. It wasn't a good fit. But I made it two days. The second day was picture day. We had to draw our favorite... I was in. Cranes, I believe in. And I was in. We had to just say to pick our favorite Bible story and just draw that. And I chose Daniel in the Lions then. I just drew Daniel just getting chewed through by five Lions. Just... Oh, one idiot. This guy. Oh, shit. Look at you. Dan. Red Cran, Dan. Look at you. DoA. You are a moron, buddy. I can... I know exactly why God got rid of you. Look at you, buddy. You have another red Cran, please. Thank you very much. Yeah, just get this guy out of here. And... None didn't like it. None didn't like it at all. And... And then, but what she really didn't like was in the corner of the picture. I drew a picture of the sun. The... The ball of fire. That gives us all life. The actual God. Uh... I drew a face on the sun. And I drew arms on the sun going. Eh! And she hated it. She hated it. She hated that I had given the sun a soul. And she took my crayons away and she leaned in. She said, I'll pray for you. No. I know. She was... She was 50. I was seven. That's... That to me, that just said, I know God. And I'm going to tell him what she did. She took my crayons away. That which felt like I think you should leave now. And... And I'm like, fine. I'm going to go look for a God that doesn't care about my crayons. No offense. Cue it on. Reliable religion. Very steady. Demon heavy. Christianity. Hold the Christ. Heavy on the demons. It's just nice to know what's there to use if I need it. If we need it, you know, if you ever need to relegate a significant portion of your fellow citizenry to demon status, you ever need to make a good portion of the people you know murderable. It's nice to know that exists. Other than that, I think we handled the pandemic pretty gracefully. I do. I do think we handled the pandemic well. I do think we did. I know. I know. All right, each other's throats, and it feels like we're in a way worse place, and in a lot of ways we are. But there were nine billion people on the planet. What the fuck do we think was going to happen? I think that we handled it pretty damn well, despite how we feel about each other. I think Republicans saved some of the economy. I think Democrats saved some of the grandparents, and all it took was a sincere, profound resentment for each other as human beings. I think Democrats saved some of the grandparents, and all it took was a sincere, profound resentment for each other as human beings. masks really through people for a loop. they didn't like that. I get that. math. breath is not nice. breath is not age well. breath is not age well. There's a reason they don't make breath-centred candles. but a plague was coming. a plague was always coming. It's the one thing that science and the Bible agreed on. I don't think everybody should have had to live the same. I drove across country last year. There's just so many different... There's nobody in Kansas. Is anybody here from Kansas? There it is. Yeah, they're here. Thank you for coming. Is it Tuiya? Are you both senators? I think Kansas is a scam. I think Kansas is a scam. There's a lot of windmills. I think Kansas is two senators, an unlimited electricity. And I just don't think... There's a lot of places in the country like that. If you live out there, if you live in New York, yeah, where it has, Matt, suit. If you live in rural Kansas, I don't think you should have to wear pants. I also don't think you should have high-speed internet access. Because you don't have enough... That's what my family's doing. You don't have enough people to bounce your ghost stories off of. People are seeing... People are in a situation where they're seeing more people on their screens than in real life. And that's a problem. Because then you don't have anybody to bounce these ghost stories that you're getting blown up your asshole from the other side of the planet on. And you got people in fucking baby-huffing dungeons. Most people are just trying to go to the grocery store. You got people on baby-huffing. You're believing... That's where I lose. You lose me on a conspiracy shit. That heavy... That heavy... That dank... Conspiracy shit. You know... Like, you know... I don't know. It's the microchip. There's microchips in the back. Really? Mandy, how many? One? Multiple? How's benefit analysis on this? How much is Bill Gates investing in mapping the route from your duplex to the strip mall nearest your duplex? Angry. I can take angry and I can take dumb. I can't... I can't take dumb and angry. Because the odds are you're angry because you're dumb. Alright! Wow! And I might speak from experience, but I don't know. If your boogie man had a Ph.D. Well then, maybe you're a little bit dumb to be this angry. I don't know, it's weird. It's weird. It's appropriate though. It's the American way. You know, what's the worst thing we could possibly put in our bodies? was the dumbest thing I could cram into my head right now. It's like food. It's like food. Q&A is just what happened when pizza restaurants started making cinnamon rolls. And, is the screens went up our goal fish ball. I get clickbait and just dumb shit online. I fall for it all the time. It's like my wife, Glamping. That's some internet nonsense right there. That is some screen-based nonsense right there. If you don't know, it's glamorous camping. It doesn't exist. There's no such thing. It's for people that hate camping and are easily fooled by the internet. What they do is they put a tarp over some wine glasses. They put pictures on Instagram. They charge $2.45 a night. You pay it and then you're an asshole for the rest of your life. And it's a cost. Here's some dumb clickbait I fell for. Submarine that turns into a yacht. Show it to me. It was just an ugly boat. It was just an ugly boat. It was just a decommissioned submarine that put a spoiler on it. That was it. It was pretty sad actually. It was greatness of a submarine. Used to do science and fight wars. Now it's getting puke done by Kelly's bachelor at party. I think he used to make movies with Jacoosto. Oh, it's got rims on it. Don't even go underwater anymore. It can't even flex its scientific muscles. That's a fancy part of submarine. We never turn into a yacht. We never stoop so low as to turn into a yacht. What do you mean? Who needs science? We got money. A butterfly doesn't turn back into a caterpillar. That glam trip made me identify with those dudes at Storm the Capitol though. That was just their glam trip. That was just their glam trip. They just wanted to go away for the weekend and pretend to do some shit they weren't doing. They just wanted to see a democracy that turned into a yacht. You know what bothered me the most about January 6th? The merch. Why is there merch? Are you guys wearing matching hooded sweatshirts? Who's selling merch at the revolution? Abraham Lincoln didn't sell top hats. What's... Do we just lose World War III to a Bartlett softball team? People are these absentee dads on Instagram live spending their child support money on merch. You got merch money. How bad am I supposed to feel? You got merch money. You're smashing up the Capitol so that your fire guy can keep his job. Who am I supposed to feel bad for here? The your fire guy. Did you imagine the slave mentality of lifting a fucking finger for the your fire guy? I for one cannot. Wild. Unreal unnecessary white trash block party that one right there. How many golf pros do you think Storm the Capitol? Not pro golfers, just guys running driving ranges somewhere. It's a serious question. Any gamblers in here want to set the line for me? Over under. Over under. 12 is way high. 12 is way high. 12 is I'm going under 12. Five. Five is a better number. Four and a half or five and a half. Three and a half. I'll let you change. It's okay. You can change your answer. You can change your answer. I like it. Back in Tagitalla, ready you and me were both bad gamblers. I would go over that, but try not. But you know there was one. I'm just saying there was one. Todd. He was on his screens too much. Whipped up on his screens. Too much time on his phone. Spent Todd. Too much time on his phone on the range was Todd. Well, they did it again. They did it again. He threw it down his sandwich. He folded up his collar shirts, put him in his leather travel bag, and went with his initials on it. And through that, he's escalated. The one his dad leases for him. For the first time in 35 years, Todd left myrtle beach. And he got to DC, and he laid eyes on DC, and he checked into the Marriott. And he got a good night's rest, and then he woke up and he saw they had an omelette bar. So he got the fucking omelette bar. Todd likes eggs. Todd likes real eggs. He put some cheddar cheese and jalapenos on there. Thank you very much. The new last day, Todd gets eggs. They're trying to take Todd's eggs away. And he got a good meal in his belly, and then he skipped off to the revolution. We're in Metis CrossFit coach, and they slammed a cops head in the door. And Bear Spray, a congressional page, and their new QAnon hood of sweatshirts. And didn't wear a mask. The one time he should have wore a mask. Todd. Todd. Todd. Todd. Now the FBI got to go to the driving range, Todd. Now they got to come to your range, Todd. I don't know. Vladimir Putin said, it's easier to fool a man than it is to convince a man he's been fooled. Vladimir Putin did not say that. Mark Twain said that. But I say that Vladimir Putin said it so that the people that need to hear it will listen. It's just, I think oftentimes we're just at the mercy of deteriorating men. I've always wanted to be a grandpa. I really don't have no interest in being a parent. I want to be a parent for like five hours a week. The rest of it looks like y'all got ripped off. The rest of it looks like a really bad deal. But I had something that I had something. I had something changed about that recently. I got a silver alert. It's an amber alert for an elderly person. Did they got him in Illinois? Okay. Right. So that's... I lost the grandpa to dementia. It's not a laughing matter. But he was doing wild shit at the end. And I thought, you know, it makes me... I'd be lucky to get to that point. And by the time I do, I'm probably going to be in a lot of pain. I'm going to be lucky to not have metal in every joint. And an organ that I want to chuck into the lake. And if I get to that point, and the brain that's reminding me how much pain I'm in every day of my life, decides to shut the fuck up, and my body gets to take a victory lap for an afternoon. And the children that I raised to completion think that it's acceptable to knock me out to the fire department. You're not dead to me, but... Shit's different now. When I can remember what you did, things are going to be different now. I mean, just take my car keys away. Don't do that. How about this? My brain shut down. I'm not on the loose. Like, did you even look? Go get your shithead cousins and a rope and a flashlight. And go walk around the neighborhood. Give me back on the patio before you start texting three counties, my all my information. Everybody I ever knew, thinks I'm out there in my PJs, running into a curb like a glitch in a video game. Go get your cousins and my grandkids. You know what? Haven't bring the birthday checks back, because I'm trying to repossess some shit. I wrote them checks in the amount of the age they were turning. It was adorable. I was super grandpa. All you had to do was get me beer and play cards with me. And this is what I get? You're out of the will, but I want you to come to the reading, because I've hired a professional wrestler to read it to you. And tell you that you don't get my cars, and I'm leaving the house to the stripper you don't know exists. That was what my grandpa was doing. He was trying to fuck a meth head stripper in Kentucky. He was driving across state lines. That's what he thought he was doing. I mean, I don't know what he did. Well, when he was leaving, he was going to fuck a meth head stripper. That's the, that's the, it started good. And then when he got there, he wrapped his car around a tree. And that's when things went bad. It's all right. And that just terrifies me. I just don't want the last thing on my body that works to be my nuts. Take my car keys, take my nuts. If I get to that point, take my balls. I'm serious. I'm honestly about to advocate for adult male castration. I am. I'm done with my nuts now. A third of the men I've ever known could handle their balls. They're ruining a perfect and good gender. Ladies, if you know any man that's functional, he's working very hard to overcome his nuts. We are walking around shit faced on our own balls all the time. Nuts are a Ferrari engine and most men are just a Honda Accord. And we are burning through tires. Our whole lives. Our whole lives. We didn't, we didn't. We didn't use the care about nuts like this. As a species we did. That's one thing that I learned from the Catholic Church. They used to cut little boys' balls off so they could hit a high note and choir. Yeah, that's real. I don't look at, I didn't do this shit. They were called castratos. That's what I'm saying. That's where nuts used to rank. Just below Christmas carols in Latin. Right here. What percentage of your bad decisions would you blame on your nuts? Hold up now. I'm giving you a chance to excuse a lot of bad behavior. 40% that's solo. That is solo. That is either you just didn't think that through or you got skeletons in your closet that you're trying to pretend aren't there. I mean, I am way up there. Well, fine. Okay, fine, 40%. Now imagine if you weren't there to stop them. You'd be up there. You'd be way up there. Right? Yeah, I don't want that. I'm not, please. I don't know. I think it's a rough situation for men when they get to that age. And then that's the only age when we finally trust them to put them in positions of power. This is why we have two types of leaders. That's why we only have two kinds of leaders. What the fuck is wrong with him? And is he okay? That's it. That's all that's left. And Vlad and his Putin is what the fuck is wrong with him. That's perfect example. He's just an old man's balls playing games with younger men's balls. Just putting younger men's balls against each other. It's a time-honored human tradition. That's just because, I mean, his nuts are servant drinks. Our brains turn to mush. Our joints he jacked and our balls are down there serving drinks the whole time. Vladimir Putin's balls are the bartender from the shining. Take my nuts. Second, I get a home depot credit card. I'm getting it. I don't want to make some of these horrific mistakes. That's the real pen. Forget QAnon. Leapblowers is the real pandemic in this country. Sometimes I do this bit and I see old dudes face kind of change. I like my leafblower. Fuck that shit, dude. Get a rake. Barry that in the backyard. We're not going to say anything about it. We're going to pretend like it never happened. That glam trip was fine. That was a beautiful vacation. We were on my wife's family reunion. It was actually awesome. It was ruined by a leafblower at 8 a.m. on Sunday morning. I was in my lean-to. I had my tarp. It was me, my tarp, leafblower. Just... Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Hell no. 245 a night. What? Absolute... In my mind, this is some asshole that travels with his leafblower. My first assumption that it was not somebody from the campsite. Hotels don't vacuum before checkout. I thought this was some guy. Because I'm ready for you people to start carrying those things in holsters. Like people... Like I thought it was just some asshole in a way in a bago that could not bear the thought of being a part of his leafblower for three days. And he was like, oh I'm going to be in the woods. Imagine all the things I can blow around in the woods. And I kicked my tarp open. I kicked my tarp open my underwear. I was looking for faces. And sure enough, it's a dude from the campsite. Collared shirt, logo and everything. I was the asshole, y'all and employees. I was like, yo, it's 8 a.m. guy. He takes his finger off the gas for a second. He's greased up hillbilly. I swear to God. Looks like he's dead in the face. God, I still got to work though. That's what he said to me. It's going to bounce off the back of my skull for the rest of my life. I still got to work though. I instantly stopped carrying about the leafblower. I was instantly distracted by this blue collar cosplay. He had typed up for himself. I swear he was somehow at work right now. It was a huge roll of golf cart with a leafblower. With an outdoor blow dryer to point it at some gravel patches. He drove to work. Got in a golf cart. Brought a blow dryer. I still got to work though. Fuck you buddy. I wasn't raised in a coal mine, okay? But I've roofed houses and painted houses and bail hay. And I was Mr. Miyagi enough to know that taking one button to the next button to the next button does not make you the backbone of the American economy guy. You are not a dock worker friend. Turn that shit down. You are ruining my lamp trip. Buttons. Thanks Buttons. Take a couple hours off. Go have some more red bull. What are you doing? I hope you don't get a kid at home playing Fortnite that you'd be rate for not popping out of bed every morning. So go move leaves around in the woods. It's everywhere. It's coast to coast. I live in LA. Ah, it's California. There's no leaves. There's no leaves. It's just dust. It's just dust. You're just whipping up the dust. You're just whipping up the dust in the air. Why? Why? Wow big is your lawn. You better have a football field to justify that thing. To justify weaponizing what used to be the ground. You're getting in your eyes. It's in my eyes and mouth and throat. You shut down my block for four hours with your fucking leaf floor. What are you doing? And where does the dust settle? Cars. All your cars. Now all your neighbors have to go get car washes because you had to have it. There could be ranges. Ranges. Away from our cars. Leaf-blower ranges. I'm standing by those. Leaf-blower ranges where cooked up step-dads can go. Micro-managed, small patches of cement for 15, 20, 30 minutes at a time. Just to blow off some steam. Whatever fixes it. I want your patch to be clean, guys. But otherwise, leaf-blower should cost $10,000. And $9,500 of that should go into a federal fund to pay for all your neighbors car washes past present future. I stand by that. All right. I'll get out of here. No, there is. I saw one guy in Kansas. It was the cop that let me out of a speeding ticket with a joke. I like that guy. I was smoking weed, I was in Kansas. I was just trying to get through Kansas. I don't care if it's legal. It's legal where I live. It's legal. I don't have. And I'm trying to figure out who don't have it figured out yet. It's, yes. I can't keep track of what states are still run by dorks from the 50s. And I wasn't even planning on my feet touching the ground in Kansas. So I was smoking weed, I was moving. A little bit later, I'll see the lights on. Damn. Okay. Pull over. Dude, we'll ox up. Real tense. Kind of cop. It seemed like he might fire tear gas to cover a fire. He comes in hot. Is that what you such a hurried for, California? I'm a stand up community. I got to get to Iowa tomorrow. I have a show in Iowa. So I had you going 81 to 65? Yeah, buddy. It's Kansas. That's about the bare minimum. I'm going to be going in Kansas. You want me to stop and check out the library guy? I'm going to need to see your license and registration. He's right here. He snatches it. Goes back to his car 20 minutes later. He comes back still hot. So I'm going to need to hear a joke. I didn't like that part. She asked me to give me the ticket. Don't make me dance. You got a hard job. I got a hard job. I'm going to make me dance. You know, I mean, he knew I didn't have my tools. This is the thing. There's the things. This thing. You're very nice. You guys are very nice. You're very nice. But if I followed you back to your hotel tonight, I tried to tell you about the Herpes vaccine. You got to get some frantic on the property right now. I want to come get this guy too sweet. But I didn't want the ticket. So I said, OK. Why did the squirrel crawl into my dickhole? His tone changed. I peaked his interest. He said, I don't know man why. I said, he was trying to get to my nuts. Well, he liked that joke more than you guys did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I like that guy. I think about that guy. I appreciated him. I felt like we grew together. I think about him. I worry about him. Because I know he's out there telling my joke. You can't force comedy. Takes a long time. I know he's out there just butchering my joke. For the god knows who Bobby, 81 and 65, California, plates. We give tickets to those. I don't see any kind of citation here or anything. He heard it. I don't give a shit, Bobby. I'm going to need to see some sort of documentation, some sort of explanation, report on my desk and today. Chief, I'm going to do it for you live. No thanks, Bobby. You got the right to remain silent. Chief, why would? How come? Why would? Why would? A squirrel, a wild squirrel. Chief, teeth and claws and shit. Kind of set not your normal squirrel that you would not be intimidated by. For the sake of this hypothetical, you on your toes. He could do some damage to you, Chief. And he wants something from you. Something from inside you. Something that you care about. And he wants it bad. Something that a squirrel regularly wants. What would he want? That you got? What would you, a squirrel, with teeth and claws and shit? I know domesticated raccoon keep on her in my porch. I'm talking about a wild animal that's got a spring in his step and coming at you. Fast and yeaming it will move for a long time. I know him for 35 years, Chief. You have slow some bitch. And he's coming for you. And he's going to get something from you, Chief. What's he want? He wants your nuts. Squirrels won't nuts. Squirrels won't nuts. Chief, Chief, he wants your damn nuts. How's he going to get there, Dickhole? Squirrel coming in your dickhole, Chief. Bobby, I'm going to need your gun and belt. I'm going to need your gun and badge. You guys have been fantastic. Thank you so much for being here, everybody. Thank you to the Green Mill. Thank you, Chicago. I love you. Thank you. Here's everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Let's welcome Neil Brennan. What's up, guys? What's up, man? How you feeling? All right. White guy giving me the peace sign. Good to see you. Hey, thank you all for coming out. I'm glad you're here. The economy's awful, isn't it? No, it's a great surprise about the economy. It's when they talk about it on the news. Back like everybody's rich. You notice that? Well, they'll be like global economic meltdown. Is your money safe? What are you in the $43? I have my checking account? It should be okay. Thank you. Then you turn the channel and they're like, has the value of your property gone down? Huh? I don't know. Let me ask my goddamn landlord. You know what the worst part of having a landlord is? People think it's the money. It's so not the money. Where's the problem of having a landlord? Is having to call the landlord. Landlord. It's a bit of an exaggerated title, isn't it? For a guy who rents out rooms to strangers for money? Landlord? Like there's something medieval about the whole thing? Whenever I see my landlord now just to mess with them, I'm always like, my lord. My lord, I come to the from the kingdom of apartment 4J. My lord, if you wouldn't mind taking off your cape, I need you to unclog my toilet. Yeah. I watch the news a lot too much. Yeah, the news. CNN is my network. Because CNN, even when it's bad news, it's kind of good on CNN. You know, it's got the saddest news on earth. You were accidentally watch that British news. No dog run, the BBC news. The sad ass British accents on there. Just the way they pronounce countries on their bummed me out, like, Afghani stand. I love it. Like they could make any news stories on sad on the BBC. Like today, packs of wooden imps travel the hillsides of New Jersey, handing out chocolate chip cookies and f*** jobs. We got to say it on New Jersey. Jesus. A lot of time on the internet as well. I heard about this website recently called It Gets Better. You guys know what this is? If you don't know what it is, it's a website where gay teenagers that are getting bullied by Tracy Morgan, kidding. I'll bestap you. No, gay teenagers that are getting bullied at school then go online and adult gay celebrities that the video's form going like, hey, I know you're getting bullied now, but just so you know, it gets better. Which sounds nice, but it's actually just some empty Hollywood stuff. If I was one of the gay kids that would be like, so celebrity, you can't help me today. Celebrities are like today. No, we're afraid the bullies as well, but best of luck to you. You know, a website would be way more effective than it gets better. Website called It Gets Worse. Where all the people that were super popular in high school had to leave videos about what losers they became later on in life. That'd be great. Actually, wait, they have that. It's called Facebook. Bang! So there was some music award show recently. The song is or something. Are you not sick of these music shows? These awards are like, there's like no good songs. Then they're just giving them awards. Like, let's give Neo a prize. Let's not. So, you know what else does it encourage about that? Remember what people used to do there? So longs in these shows and get off stage. That's not enough for these ego min eggs. The show was how hard they worked. So like Usher will finish his song. He's applauding and instead of getting off stage, Usher stands there and does this. It's like Usher, you lip sync the song. You didn't witness a murder. Get off stage. Yeah. Fellas, nobody, no. Fellas, no woman on earth wants to look at her phone and see a picture of your dick. Yeah. Yeah. Ever. Our bodies are disgusting. They're not made to be photographed. That's a women's body. We're women's bodies are beautiful. They got curves and padding and their own cafeteria. They have a lot happening. Our bodies are not made to attract women. Our bodies are made to see attractive women. Chase them down with our superior speed. So do them with our superior strength. Try to make a baby. Here we go. This is the face I make. I love you. So, um, single. No, I'm single. So girls will send me pictures of their boobs sometimes. And it's the best. That never happens to my married guy friends. I shouldn't say it never happens. My married guy friends, their wives, will send them pictures of their boobs. But it's always with a note that says like, I think my rash is back. So girls will send me pictures of their boobs. And then I got to send something back. This is about all we have to send. So, but fellas, women don't want that. They, so put something in the frame. If you're going to take a picture of it, the women actually like, put like a scented candle down there. Or like a gift certificate for Sephora. Yeah. Or like a bigger dick. Something. Women are sensual creatures. You understand me? So, they don't want the organ. They want a hint of sexuality. So, if you got abs, take a picture of your abs. You know what else women like? Women like this thing. Whatever this is, the ramp. Yeah. The on ramped dick city. For the black girls, the de-angelo muscle. Huh? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is romantic. But this is like the notebook. This is a walk to remember. This is Alien 3. We live in a porn-y ass world, don't we? Just gets porn here by the day. Hey, by the way, if you work in porn, I don't know of you and your co-workers know this. But we have enough porn. You don't have to keep making it. You did a great job. We appreciate your service. But you can shut it down. If you make porn or if you make those crocs shoes, we're good. Porn used to amaze me. I'd be like, how'd they get that man and that lady to have sex at that bakery? But now the older I get the more I realize, men and women have sex at the easy part of relationships. You know what's like a fantasy to me now? You know what we'll be porn to me today? Just video of a man and a woman getting along. Like, wait, he has to work late and she's not going to take it personally? Oh, that's hot. Wait, they went to a party together and they want to leave it the same exact time? Oh, my God, where they find these people. Wait, she wants to talk about the new duvet cover. He doesn't give a crap and she doesn't give a crap that he doesn't give a crap? Oh, that's going to make me finish. So we want you ladies. And we want you. And we don't know how to get you. We used to just be able to chase you down and grab you. But I made that illegal like 10,000 years ago. So now we got to be romantic. We don't know anything about that. And there's no end in amount of romance versus give you ladies. Because we'll take you out to dinner. Right, we're going to pay. Which for a guy is like insanely romantic. But it's not enough. You know, I know it's not enough. Because they always let that lady into the restaurant. What lady? Creepy as lady on earth. God damn flower lady. Turn it worse than that woman. Whenever I say I'm like, who let her in here? Procise for the lady. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Do women even want the roses at the restaurant? No. No, a lot of nose. You know why, fellas? Because the roses are too convenient. Yeah. Women only like presents if they're super inconvenient to get. Yeah. Yeah. Women want us to wait in line for six hours or like drive to the next state. They just want a story they can tell their girlfriends and brunch about how much we suffered for them. Like, oh, you don't know about these earrings? These are the earrings that would Mike Goddard for me. He fell on the escalator and lost part of his hand. I don't even like the earrings, but I like the mic was legally dead for two minutes to do that. It's such a one way street. That's the thing. Some make real sensitive to guys' issues. One part of the year is just about giving presents to women. I'm doing thanks, giving it Valentine's Day. Every commercial on TV is about giving presents to women. Give her a December to remember. A diamond is forever. Mary kiss begins with cake. You know why all the commercial are for women? Because you can't advertise what guys want. Yeah. Like legally, you're not allowed. You'll never see commercial like ladies. This holiday season give him the gift he's waiting for all year. A day of silence followed by a three-way with you and your hottest friend. You followed by more silence. Only from JC Penny. Ladies and gentlemen, we don't want to talk to you. We don't want to talk to our guy friends. Not about anything real or emotional. What are your sports or for? Completely meaningless. Football sounds like it's invented by an eight-year-old girl. There's a ball. And you get four tries to take the ball of ten yards. In between each try, we're going to be a huddle. We're going to be a secret about the other team. By the way, we're all wearing capri pants. And half time the black eyed peas are going to play. I don't know what we want to talk to us about. We're jerks. Guys are jerks. You want to know what guys are really like? Look what we're doing when there's no women around. We're just going to slap each other and insulting each other's appearance and trying to injure one another's testicles. Women are nice. Look at men's surprises. Look at women's surprises. Women's surprises are nice. Women's surprises are like today with Gil's birthday. And we all pretend like we forgot. And then at 4.30 we were about to cup cakes. And she was so surprised. And a guy's surprise is like, Joe wasn't paying attention so he lit his back on fire. And then we found out his birthday. We said his car on fire too. He was really surprised. Hey, where are we on Obama? We like him? You vote for him, brother? You vote for him? Yeah. Brother, you vote for him? Yeah. Every brother I know vote for. Did brothers even need to punch the batter? You just walk in and be like, All right, put me down for my man. Bitch, you know what the f*** this is. All right. I like the dude. I vote for him. But in some ways he's like, America's a rebound boyfriend. You know what I mean? We just want to be able to call George Bush. And be like, here with someone else, not George. And get this. He listens to us. And he doesn't just attack people for no reason. And oh yeah, did I mention he's black? Click. Yeah. You know, the other thing is he gets blame for a lot of stuff. But I feel like 70% of the stuff he gets blame for is bush's fault. Yeah. Yeah. It's sad because it's just another case of a brother being the wrong place the wrong time. Getting accused of some stuff he didn't do. America's like, freeze, put your hands against White House. Like it was George Bush and Dick Cheney. They just f***ed left. Yeah. And they sometimes say, I followed the administration pretty closely. And they say like, you know, he's too insulated against his critics. And then, but he, so he relies on Sasha and Malia and Michelle to keep him humble. But that might keep him humble. But you know what I'm really humble is if Sasha and Malia were white. They're like 12 and 14. They're sweet girls. But if they were white, there's no one meaner on earth than 12 and 14. They're like the meanest little bitches on the planet. Because now he comes on when he's like Sasha Malia study, hard getting no good school. And they're like, yes, yes, Danny, we love you. But if they were white, he'd come on be like Sasha Malia study, hard getting no good college. And they're like, for what? You ruin the economy. There's not any job we get out and you jackass. We're going to can't do it. Hopefully you won't wreck America while we're gone dumbass. Oh, look, Sasha. It's Danny's birthday. It's psych. You don't have one foreigner. Like I said, I like the dude. Votiform. Can I vote for him again? But I'm going to say, yeah. I'm in this, yeah. In some ways, the expectations were so high that I haven't been this disappointed in the president since all of the other presidents. But with Obama, the thing is I gave him money. That's what it hurt. Like I believe in the dude so much that I donated to his campaign. Obama was basically the stripper that I was like, no, fellas. This one really likes me. He wants some co-pump, hey baby, you need some change? Hey, co-pump, co-pump, co-pump, co-pump, co-pump. You killed Ben Laden. That was something. Yeah. Then I got mad at Barack because he didn't release the photos. But again, Barack's a nerd, man. The president, Erkel. But America's a bloodthirsty. They wouldn't have been having less Barack came out with like a tear drop tattoo. It was like, yeah, there's been Laden stuff done, son. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not doing it. It's black stuff. So Obama. Black dude. Of course, and I've worked with black dudes before, not your pal show. Of course, which I was the, you're just painting. The reason all the people are wanting is because I co-create the pal show. racial sketches because we used to do the best racial sketches on Chappelle, we did like the blind whites and premises, we did the bloopers from Roots. And I, and I, I still think of these crazy ass racial sketches and I got nowhere to go with them, but I thought one recently, that'll pitch to you guys if you wanna hear it. Yeah. Alright. Alright, but don't be babies, alright? Cause, cause this is racial. Alright. I wish we could have done a sketch about how scared white people must have been on the last day of slavery. Cause it was a real day. It's January 30th, 1865. Like, what do white people do that day? Can I see all the slaves in the front please? Oh Jesus. Well, we had a heck of a run, didn't we? I just wanna say you guys did a fantastic job with the chores. These last 250 years. You'll be free tomorrow. Please don't murder us. Violence doesn't solve anything. Oh really, what all the time you're whipping us? T-Shay, Toby. T-Shay. Now, have you guys went mind clearing out your stuff the Mexican should be here any minute to apply to? Alright, thank you guys very much, those straight hats, good night. Thank you. You

I love being a lady now, you know, cause you can say shit that you couldn't, for example. I could tell y'all right now that sometimes I'm in a shower and I gotta pee. I don't get out that muppet. I'm fine. Shit. I figured a water going down any motherfucking way after. Shit, why would I not tell it, don't you know? I know what you're thinking. She's such a fucking lady.

Yeah, all my lips are big, motherfucker. That's right. See, see, here's a cat, a motherfucker. Highly enough, blowjob. And he ran about a sad phone, little old feet. So you know it's dick smart. I couldn't give him no blowjob. My big ass lips, his little old dick, it wouldn't work. And he like trying to give a whale a tic-tac motherfucker. And she wouldn't work. It wouldn't work. It wouldn't work. Oh my god. Oh my god. I have my last. I can't walk with that man. Hey, my name's Adele Getter. I'm the judge of the show.
One minute. One minute. Mark, listen, I know exactly what you're thinking right now. You're thinking this my first hour special, and I'm freaking out. And I don't deserve it, and you're thinking you're not funny enough, and that you're not good looking enough for television. And just you, I need to quiet all of those thoughts. You have every right to be here. And it's not just because I'm producing it for you that they let you do it. And yeah, you're just average height and weight, and very forgettable looking. But it's not about that. It's about comedy. Tonight's about jokes. Jokes that aren't good enough that you're about to tell. But I don't want you to think about any of that right now. Don't let anything get in the way up here. Because you are better than everyone says you are. Now you're just going to go out there and kill it. What are you going to do? Save your voice. OK. You're going to be so good. I don't regret this. I didn't try to back out. OK. Oh. It's me. What a great crowd. Yes. Thank you guys so much for having me. Thank you guys so much for coming. Welcome to one of the best nights of your god damn life. OK. Welcome. We're going to have so much fun tonight. I am so proud to welcome to the stage one of my favorite all-time comedians. Ladies and gentlemen, please make some noise for Mark Norbert. Thank you guys. Thanks. Thank you. You're right over here. Hey. All right. Hey, everyone. Yeah. All right, Jesus Christ. Thanks. Thanks for coming, huh? Yes. I feel bad. This is a big event. I'm a little hungover. Isn't that amazing? You know, we still can't prevent to hangover. We have all this medical research. I've tried the water. I've tried the pills. Nothing works. We can prevent children. Right? We can't prevent a hangover, you know? At least some people want kids. I've never woken up like, ooh, I am really hungover. But you know what? I think I want to keep it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I got to cut back on the sauce, man. I blacked out last week. That's embarrassing. I'm too old for that. I told my roommate, he's like, oh, you're blacked out. Ooh. That means you forgot to brush your teeth last night. I was like, wow, that is the least of my worries. I'm more concerned with the lipstick I'm wearing. Why is that my mom a dick pick? Yeah. She was like, oh, a family plan. Yeah. He's hangovers. You know, people always talk about how honest you are in your drunk. You hit that a lot. Get that guy drunk. I'll tell you anything. I feel like I'm whim-er-honest when I'm hungover. When I'm drunk, I can lie all day. That cops like you've been drinking. I'm like, no way. Ah. When I'm hungover, that's when I'm honest. My life's in shambles. I have nothing to live for. Yeah. Yeah, your friends like, you want to get brunch? You're like, eh. I've never liked you. Everything's alive when you're drunk. You know, you're like, hey, it's the best night ever. These are my good friends, and she's super hot. Then you wake up. Like, as a waste of time, I spent too much money, and that's a dude. Yeah. I don't know. I guess I'm an alcoholic. If I'm going to be addicted, any drug, though, I'm glad it's alcohol. Yeah. Just so easy to get. Right? Yeah. That's crazy. Like, I think that's why alcohol is the only drug you pour out for dead friends. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You would never have like cocaine, you know. You're like, well, I was your poor little, whoa, whoa, we all love Greg, but that's just expensive. All right. Yeah. Take it easy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See, I drink a lot, but I still get my stuff done. You know, I'm what you call a functioning alcoholic. Any functioning alcoholics here? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We get a bad rap, huh? Why is that a negative term? We're actually harder working. Everyone else, yeah. We're doing the same stuff you're doing drunk. Where's our parade? What? Bob should up to work on time? Screw Bob. I slept here. Yeah. We're tough. We don't bitch. Suzy didn't show up. She's the flu. Well, I have disease and I'm keeping it a secret. Yeah. Where's my plaque, huh? Yeah. I don't know. Hmm. I was hung over on a flight the other day. That's the worst. Oh, flight hung over. Oh, God. I hate flying. I see the only part of this job. I hate flying. I hate flying. I hate flying. I hate flying. I see the only part of this job I hate. I like a train. Give me an amtrak any day. No bag check. No security. It's almost like they've never heard of a terrorist. Yeah. I hate flying. Flying is so high maintenance. Flying is a high maintenance girl. You want to get inside me? You got here an hour early. Take your shoes off and do a body scan. You're like, dude, it's a surprise. Good Lord. Not a train. A train is like a drunk chick. Like, get a beer. Get in here. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! No security on a train whatsoever. You can walk on a train with three suitcases full of cocaine. Like, hey, see something? Say something. Chee-chee! Ha! Ha! This is how sad and desperate trains are. Trains don't ask to see your ticket until the train has left the station, right? They've already started moving and then they ask, how much of a fuck could they really give? Take us, please. I don't have one. We gotta buy one now. I don't have any money. I'll figure it out. Ha! Ha! Enjoy Newark. Alright, yeah. Ah, I just hate flying. They've ruined it. It's so nerve-racking. Every flight is an anxiety attack, you know? Every time I have a flight, I feel like it's my first day of class all over again. I'm eight years old and I'm back at school. You know, you're on that plane, single-file line, book bag on, just trying to find your seat, you know? Then you finally get to your seat, people pull out snacks and start farting. Right? Right? And the flight attendant, she's terrifying. She's like the teacher, you know? She's kind of hovering. She's nerve-racking. She scares you. She walks by. You hide your phone telling you're reading. Ha! And she gives you a little lecture. Hey, seat belt, seat belt. You know, then the pilot. He's like the principal. He's up in his office. Comes on a loudspeaker, you know? Right? He don't really want to meet him, but you know if you do, you're in trouble. Right? Right? Right? And you're like, all right, I got a pee. You can't pee now. 32 years old. It's not pee time. Sit down. It's Christ. Good Lord. Now you're pissed. Now you're just waiting it out. You're like a teacher. How much longer? Jesus Christ, you're counting the minutes. Then the plane lands, the bell rings. You grab your stuff. You fight your way through the building. You find your mom. She drives you home. Ha! Ha! Ah, cheers. Oh, come on. Ha! All right. Hey. Love a train. You only flaw a train though. If you fall asleep on a train, they just keep going. You know? They don't know where you live and they don't care. Right? Every time I wake up on a train, I look like a roofy victim. I'm like, where are we? Who is he? Ha! Ha! Ha! It's so dramatic. You miss your stop on a bus or a subway. You walk a couple extra blocks. You miss your stop on a train. You get out and you're like, well, I guess is my new life. Ha! All right. I don't know. That's just me though. I worry about everything. I got really bad anxiety. Horrible anxiety. Riddled with anxiety. I live in the city. I don't have a car. I just walk around everywhere. You guys ever do this one? You guys ever leave the house without headphones? Whoo! Thoughts are not good. Ha! My God, this whole time, I thought I love music. Turns out I just hate my brain. Just being attacked all day long with this insecurity playlist on shuffle. What are you doing in your life? You drink too much. You're going to die alone. You call that a penis? Ah! Ah! Bad head. My brain is evil. Like it taxed me. It's like a bully. I'll be at a party, hanging out. Everybody's having a good time talking. My brain's like, hey, you weirdo. You're being too quiet. Everybody's wondering why you're such a quiet weirdo. Come on. Get in there. Say something. You looted it. Come on, you freak. Jump in. You're like, oh, come on. Get in there. You find a say something. Your brain goes, woo! That's what you picked. Ah! Shut up, dummy. Damn it. My brain never stops. I can't sleep at night. I'm a horrible sleeper. That's why I hate these bed commercials. You see it 4 a.m. Hey, you can't sleep. Well, how come was your mattress? What's your sleep number? How's your firmness? You think lack of comforts would keep me up at night? And that's a problem, really? I'm a team show I got going up here, right? Yeah, it's the worry of the anxiety, the dread. I don't need to match this design by NASA. I need to XANX up to self-esteem. All right. Come on. Comfort. I can sleep on a gravel road if I had a good childhood. All right. Come on. Yeah. Brain never stops. That's why I never got these guys like, hey, I'm going to bed. I'm like, what are you even going to bed? I got to pass out. I can't just go to bed, all right? What do you create? You want me to lay alone in the room in the dark? Am I into where? That's what screwed me up in the first place. Yeah. Roodle. I don't think I'm depressed, though. I wouldn't say I'm depressed. Although the symptoms of depression, binge drinking, hard get out of bed, avoiding people, those are all the things that make me the most happy. They always show these commercials. Some guys depressed, pops a pill, and now he's skydiving, riding a convertible. Then they show the depressed guys in bed with a bunch of pizza boxes. I'm like, that's living. Yeah. Yeah, I'm an awkward guy. Very awkward. Can't make eye contact with people. See, that was tough. Yeah. I'm working on it. It's too intense, too intimate. I don't know how you people do this, you know? It's like a sign of respect. It looks up in the eye. It blows my mind. It's too much. I can't do it. Every time I look at somebody, I'm like, well, I guess we're in love now. I feel too much. I feel like, everything makes me uncomfortable. Certain words are hard to say. It makes me feel too weird. I love you. That's tough, huh? I can't say it. I can barely say croissant. What a horrible word. It's so pretentious. Good Lord. I can barely order one. They look amazing. I'm like, I'll take a muffin. Screw it. Yeah. Yeah. Socially awkward, you know? I know I'm socially awkward. I asked my friend what his biggest fear was. He said, losing his child. He said, what's your biggest fear of markets? I said, huh. I accidentally hang the FaceTime button on my phone. Is there a more terrifying moment of life than that? Can't people see me? I'm not ready. I go weird stuff going on in my room. I'm eating two out of a can. I got half a boner and old earbook open. It's weird. Yeah. Oh, man. Too much. Oh, yeah. I'm an introvert. Introvert, here. Hey, all right. You guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You guys. Rarely. Speak up. Yeah. Not fun being an introvert. You know, you just got to get out there and fake it. Yeah. Hard around people. Most people like being around people for us. It's like, work. It's tough. Like this is an introvert's biggest fear right here. You're hanging out with some guy. I don't only know. You're like, all right, man. Good hanging out. I'm going to take the train home. This guy goes, oh, yeah, what train you're taking? I was gonna take the number six. Hey, me too. Fuck. Damn it. Back on the clock. Tough to go around people, day jobs. I don't know how you guys do it. Nine to five, eight hours with this group. Then five o'clock rolls around. Some guy goes, hey, we should all get drinks. But he's not joining out more. We're done. We did it. We're outside the walls. Let's go home. That's not a happy hour. That's unpaid overtime. Yeah, we like being alone. We do. You ever got to eat with a guy? He's like, hey, look at that dude. It's sitting by himself. You're like, I know. Living the dream. Yeah. It's just a weird brain I got. Like, I want you guys to like me, but I'm scared of you. You bum me out, but I need your love. Basically, I'm saying, if you have a party, I don't want to go. But if you don't invite me, I'll kill myself. This is where I'm at. Up here. Yeah. And if you don't get these jokes, just know your life is better than mine. I know what you guys are thinking. Come on, Mark. Introvert. Talking about 400 people right now. Well, it's pretty simple. This is a one-sided conversation that's been prewritten or rehearsed over and over. And if you guys talk, you get thrown out. I can't lose. You guys are the real heroes. You guys want to just walk in your office break room. Just be popping and scat and knock the cuff. No net. You know? You walk in and like, hey, Bob, how was your weekend? I'm like, oh, that was good. How did you know to say that? Holy hell. Which I get improv clash. You're like, Miles Davis over here. Holy moly. Wow. Not me. I got to prep everything. Everything's prepped. I see the break room 20 feet away. I'm like, right, how you doing, Bob? How you doing, Bob? How you doing, Bob? How you doing, Bob? How you doing, Bob? How you doing, Bob? Then I get in there and I panic. I go, uh, juice. Ah, fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Ah, fuck. Damn it. Ah, man. I've always been like this and thank God for humor. Jesus Christ. You can get away with it. I remember one time I was at a friend's house for dinner and the dad goes, let's all go around the table and say we're thankful for. And one son was like, well, we're thinking of the food in the table. And one son was like, well, we're thinking of the roof over her head. And they're like, but what do you think before Mark? I was like, well, honestly, I'm thankful. I'm not attracted to kids. What in that suck? Be a horrible life, you know? And everybody there was like, whoa, what the hell is that? Holy Jesus. Good Lord. And I didn't get us like, wait, why are you mad? I'm saying I'm not attracted. Not attracted. Not into them. What's the problem? Like I piss. I was like, screw you guys. I'm the only one here clearly not a pedophile. I don't know. I think, uh, you know, you can't be yourself all the time. That's the problem. Especially like with girls and stuff. That gets ugly. All right. Well, you say what you're thinking with a lady that'll put that right to bed, you know? Yeah. Like, I remember one time I was on a date with a girl going pretty well, went back to her place. I take out a condom. She goes, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where'd you get that thing? I was like, well, they were free at the bar. She was like, ugh, that's gross. I was like, well, that's where I got you. The girl at the bar? I got to go. I don't know why that's... I'm still not sure why that's offensive. Yeah. I always bring your own condom, so I don't want the girl provided. Yeah. One time I was hooked up with a girl, she goes, hey, you've a condom. I said, I forgot. She goes, I might have one. Starts digging through her stuff. She finds one. Magnum. Oh. Damn it. This went from a good time to a challenge. I was like, all right, well, let's give it a whirl. Why not? So she ripped it open. She rolled it on and it fit. It fit. I got to tell you people. That is a man's version of Cinderella right there. Yeah. Oh. I was bell of the balls. Yes. Oh, that's great. I mean, it fit, but it fit like a sweater on an interrequisite girl. But it fit. God damn it. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of dating sites out there now. I think guys like the dating sites because it's tough to approach a woman. Cold. I don't know where, especially when you're doing this. Yeah. Tough. It's a tough move. So I feel like women, she hit on men more. Head on us, ladies. You can say whatever you want to a guy. I had an older lady approach to me once. She goes, ooh, I'm going to kidnap you. I was like, wow, I could never say that to a woman. Oh. I said that to a lady. She calls the police. I would be curious to know what a woman could say that would offend me. Like, all right, I'm going to take you home, drug you, take advantage of you, and film it. I'd be like, all right, well, at least let me pay for the Uber. I don't know. I'm just jealous of you, gals, you know? You have options. You have the freedom to say no. Like, if a girl goes on a date with a guy, and this guy takes out his Nazi memorabilia, she's like, I get the hell out of here. If I go on a date with a girl, and she takes out her Nazi memorabilia, I'm like, I got to bang her and get the hell out of here. It could be a long winner. You got to stock up, you know? You ladies just so sexy and driving crazy. You're so hot. You just want to squeeze it. You're so sexy with your wacky labia. I love it. Ah! This is how sexy girls are. I was up dinner once. This girl leans over during the meal and goes, hey, I'm not wearing any underwear. Oh my god, that's hot. Then I realize, why is that sexy? Has underwear ever been a huge obstacle for a guy? Has any guy ever taken a girl's jeans off, seen panties? They've been like, woo! It's gonna be a long night. Put a pot of coffee on. I can't crack that code. But that's how hot you are, gals. You can tell my article of clothing you're not wearing. I can't even see it missing. I'm already turned on. That doesn't work for a guy. I can't pull that off. I lean over during dinner. Hey. I'm not wearing any underwear. She's gonna go, uh-oh. What happened? Laundry day, diarrhea, need a wet wipe? Talk to me. I don't know. It's just tough to date now. You know, we have no patience anymore. We want everything immediately now. We have everything quick. We want Uber, Tinder, Netflix. Everything's so quick now. We don't want a quick at sex. What is that gonna catch up? I was with a girl the other night. I finished kind of early. She was like, hey, what's going on here? I was like, well, these are the times we're living in. Come on. I don't know the patience. We've had a giant to be buffering. Let's go! You're an analog girl in the digital world. Is this their pickin' up? Yeah. Yeah, everything's different now. You know? Like, uh, one time I sat down with a girl, she goes, just better. She goes, you don't send dick pics to you. I was like, no, no. She's like, good. Dicks are gross. I was like, well, shit. That's all I got. That was gonna be like my big reveal. What the hell are you doing here? You're like, dick. You hear that a lot of girls, dicks are gross, dicks are gross. It's weird to think something's gross that eventually put inside you. I don't get that thought process. I think coconut's gross. You see me eating one. You're like, what are you doing? I'm not like, it was charming. I'm not, I don't know, a real dick pic kind of guy. You know, I don't know if my dick is impressive enough to register well on a phone. You know? My dick's like an indie band. You gotta see it live. You gotta be in the room to really understand it. Well, I was in a relationship for like 11 years. Yeah, now I'm out there scared alone. Flass it. Yeah. I'd learn all the tricks of the trade again. I learn everything in the hard way, you know? It's tough. Yeah. Like, I learned that girls, they don't like it when the guy says the word sex on a date. It's like saying bomb at the airport. The whole thing shuts down, right? We're all like sex. It feels like we can't bring it up. The only way to get the thing you want is to pretend like you don't want it. That's weird behavior. What if job interviews were like that? So Mark, why do you want to work here? Who says I want to work here? I'm just hanging out, taking it easy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was on a date once. I was like, I'm just going to go for it. I go, hey, you want to make out? This girl goes, uh, grow up. I was like, okay. Anel. That's older, right? Yeah. Yeah, I learned the hard way too. The girls like when a guy is a plan ready for the day. He's got some planned out. Which, how did guys get stuck with that chore? Right? I had a girl ask me at once. We show up, we meet. She's like, hey, what are we doing? I'm like, I don't know what we doing. She's like, didn't plan anything. I'm like, no, did you? She's like, no. I'm like, well, then you're just as worthless as me. Why do I have to figure it out? I believe in equal rights. Can we work on this together? And she was like, well, it's very manly when a guy plans a date. No, it's not. Just convenient for you. How's that manly chopping wood as manly, wrestling a bear as manly? Is nothing manly about googling top-buss and beastroes? Come on, ladies. You got the right to vote in 1920. Let's use that on restaurants, huh? I don't know where to go, because I have a dick. I'm a zaggot. Help me out. What the hell? Manly. Come on. I've noticed women only call things manly when they like it about a guy. Oh, he pays for dinner, he protects me. It's never like, oh, he wants to bang my friends going bald. He's so manly. Ah! It's manly too. What's the credit for that? Yeah. Ah, yeah. Tough to figure out what to do. One time in a girl we couldn't figure out anything to do, we went people watching. That's a very New York thing, huh? People watching? Should we call it what it really is? We're just people judging, isn't it? I've never been bird watching. I mean, like, ooh, I wonder if that sparrow knows he's gay. Ah! Ah! That's not a sparrow, that's a swallow. But hey, it's got to be tough to date as a woman. I can't even imagine what that's like dating dudes. God, that's got to be awfully. You get murdered. Kind of a soul patch. Oh, yeah, God. Crazy. Yeah. It's got to be tough. But all the women can say stuff men can never say, you know? Yeah, like, one time I was eating dinner with a girl, I was telling a story. She cut me off mid-story. She goes, you want a like-a-guy? Like a strong silent type. I was like, what? Did you imagine if a guy said that? What do you look for in a woman? Silence. I like a woman who's tough and shuts the hell up. You kicked out of society. I don't know. Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm screwed up sexually, you know? I caught my parents having sex when I was eight, 21, and today. Ah, yeah. Ah, the idea of your parents having sex is so horrifying, isn't it, you know? That's why I'm surprised parents will use that as a threat. Hey. Wouldn't that be so effective? Like, hey, Timmy, you better clean that room. We're gonna go at it. Hey, what's that math, does Billy? I got a D. I'll show you some D. Alright, ah! Yeah, it's tough out there. I'm seeing somebody now, but boy, single life, yeah. That's the real deal, you know? People are so kind of sending to single people. They go at your single, aww. Don't you get lonely? Like, well, sure, but how come we always assume loneliness is worse than a relationship? I feel like loneliness is a lot of these other managed, definitely these things get out of. You get lonely, call a friend, go to a movie. If you're in a barrel of shit, you're like, well, I guess I got a killer. Or him, or him. My ex, she was tough. My ex was like a real big feminist. I'm a feminist, but she was like, annoying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She would always say stuff like, men just judge women by their looks, it's all about her looks. What about her achievements? Which is true, men do do that, but ladies, you do it too, we all judge women. Alright. Alright, like, one time she got me flirted another girl, and she was like, what does she look like? That was the first question. I was like, whoa! What about her achievements? Ha, ha, ha. She's a human being, goddammit. When you're single though, you miss love, it's nice to have love, it's nice to have someone love you. That's nice. But that's the thing. We all want the love, but nobody wants to do the work. It's just what the love part, yeah. It's kind of like a dog walker. We all have our dog, but you pace my do the stuff you don't want to do. Pick up the poop, walk it. Wouldn't be great to have a girlfriend walker. Just some guy on the sidewalk with eight girlfriends on a leash, like, alright. Tell me about your day. Yeah. Get mad about a dream you had. Ask me some hypothetical about you getting late. Cry now, cry now. Then you get your girlfriend back, like, did she cry? Took a while, was she crying? Yeah. Ah, yeah. A lot of women hate that joke, which is how you know it's real. I don't know. Maybe I'm just being bitter. My last girlfriend dumped me, said I wasn't manly enough for her, not a manly guy. That one hurt. I know, we're allowed to say stuff like that. Like, how come a woman can say something like, yeah, like I was good with his hands, you can fix stuff around the house. And you're like, alright, cool. But if a guy says, hey, I like a woman can cook, people go, whoa, whoa, it's not the 50s. Well, how come her job for me is okay? My job for her is not okay. Also, who doesn't like somebody can fix stuff around the house? I'd let her come home, my girl, and I was like, hey, I built the deck. Alright, hell yeah, I'll do laundry. So I think women are just so smart, because you guys made your gender roles offensive. Yeah, that was very clever. Well played, ladies, well played. Guys, how great would that be if we get offended? A girlfriend makes you a 4am or a glass shattering. Somebody break hand, you're like, well, it's not the 50s. Go check it out. Yeah. I will say this, I'm sick of good looking people. I'm done with you. Men and women, you think everything you say is interesting. You've never had it tough, you know. I want to date with a girl once, she was gorgeous. We had her my league, beautiful woman. But she had nothing to say, she was boring, she had no personality. And I checked out at one point, she goes, look, I can tight all like me, she just want to sleep with me. And I was like, well, yeah, but that's your fault. And she was like, screw you, I'm more into pretty face, I'm like, yeah, but that's all you worked on. Right, hours on your hair, makeup, outfit, get a goddamn knock knock joke together. I don't get these good looking people, they spend 100% of their time on a look, zero on their personality. You just assume that part's amazing. Why would you work on that too? All right, before a date, everybody goes, how do I look? Don't ever go, is it am I annoying? Isn't that more important? You know, like, that's what you got to worry about. I don't know how to hot guy. Before a date, I'm writing jokes in my hand, Librix, Anik Doats. I'm bringing it, baby, I'm tap dancing out there, yeah. Hey, yeah. Come on, I'm working it. Labor girls don't mean Mark, you're funny, but you're not that hot, I'd be like, I know. That's why I'm funny. I'm gonna fill in the gaps here, you know what? I'm not one of these guys just full of shit, like, hey, it looks don't matter, it's all about the inside that counts us. Shut up, come on. We all would be found to track, we all would be with something, we find a track, but I hate people lie about that. I was at a party once, I was like, I got that, Caitlin Jenner, she's kind of weird looking, some girl goes, hey, she's beautiful, and I was like, well, you kind of look like her, and she was like, fuck you. So, what's one is it, you know? Yeah, X-Girlfriend was Jewish, big old Jew, yeah, yeah. We dated for a while, just found out my X-Girlfriend's getting breast implants, that blew my mind. I use the term breast implants, I don't like the term fake breasts, doesn't make sense to make. The breast is real, it's just the shit inside that's fake. The breast is still real, it's kind of like the Bible. The book is real, it's just the shit inside that's fake. Look, there's some letter, letter book. Boy, the Bible, what a buzzkill, huh? Yeah, they don't like anything fun, they hate gay, they hate trans. That's gonna be great when doing stuff so sexually advanced, I'm in the Bible. You know, like, I love having sex with my robot, the guys like, alright, you're good. Maybe I'll try it, Jesus Christ. I know some people get mad when you make fun of their religion, you know, which I never got. If you believe it, just believe it, what's about what I say? I believe in gravity, so I'm like, hey, gravity's not real, I'm feeling like, alright, good luck out there. I don't know, religion just feels silly, come on. Who needs God, we got Google, we're good. He writes back, just really falling off over the years. You know, like 60 years ago, rock and roll is considered the devil's music. Now there's Christian rock. Well, what the hell happened there? What, if we wait long enough, they just join in? What's next? 20 years from now? Hey, Christian gay porn. I can already see the first movie, come here son, Neil before me. I don't know, I don't mean to bash it, I just don't think people really believe. That's my theory, I don't think you're really by it. You know, we were brought up with it's tradition, I went to Catholic school, you know, but I don't think people really believe it. You're really believing the devil, it's a red guy with horns, pitchfork, waiting for you, you know. He's the most evil thing ever. We're too casual about it, we got food named after him. We got devil eggs. We got devil's food cake. We have a hockey team called the New Jersey Devils. You would never name a sports team after something actually real and evil. Never have like the Detroit ISIS coming at you. We're going to take you head off. Hey, Holocaust Panini. All right, right on the oven. Whoa, slavery soft sir. Don't get this world, get mixed to colors. That's actually real and evil. Yeah. The most evil thing ever, we're too casual about it. We say something like, hey, speak of the devil, here's Greg. Which comparing Greg, the most evil thing of all time, Willie Nilly, out of the blue. You would never have something real and evil. And never like, hey, speak of Jared Fogel, here's Greg. Like, what? No, I hate kids. No, no, I hate kids. I don't know, I think I'm just jealous of religious people. Must be nice. Must be comforting to really believe something, you know. That must be nice. I really tried religion. I really tried. I pray nothing happened. I talk to God, nothing happened. Zero results, zero. How is that acceptable? I feel like we let religion sligh because it's free. If you had to pay for religion once a month like Netflix, you'd be like, well, this shit isn't working. I'm going to try that agnostic network after this. Because at least that's free. Yeah, I'm sorry. Just throw my thoughts at you here, folks. I know. Weird. You guys are nice. Some crowds don't take it as well. I got called a douche bag at a show recently. That's a fun word, huh? Douche bag? Yeah, because the insult is more popular than the actual product. I don't know anyone who's ever used a douche, never seen one. What is like a ziploc? I have no idea. I feel bad for the guy who invented the thing. Some guy in the 1800s. I invented this thing for women's hygiene. We're all like, nice job, man. We're just going to use that to describe dudes and fedoras. I did some research on it. The douche bag is actually bad for women. It's not good for you. So apparently, I invented it kind of a douche. That's the thing. I'm getting older. I got to get it together. Getting older. Getting older is tough. Everything kind of starts falling apart when you get older. About a year ago, I got paranoid about losing my hair, started taking propitia. I could not get an erection. You remember, sir? Yeah, right. This girl I was dating at the time was like, hey, you got to get off those pills. I'd rather have an erection than hair. Which is nice to hear, but that only makes sense when you're dating somebody. It doesn't work in the beginning. Like, if I was a bald guy that hit on her at a bar, like, hey, can I buy you a drink? She's like, I'm good. I'm like, that. I have a boner. Yeah. Hair loss is scary, man. I don't have women to realize so much, guys. Think about that, you know? I was telling my friend, I'm like, I'm worried my hair is going to thin. My friend goes, I know what you're going through, buddy. I'm going gray. I was like, well, changing colors, a lot different than losing something. That'd be like, if I said, yeah, I went to the beach a day. Shark attack. I lost my leg. My friend's like, I feel you, man. Tan line. Yeah. Being an adult, it's tough. You can tell being an adult is hard just by the abbreviations we use. You know? When you're a teenager, it's like, LOL. Well, OMG, BRB. When you're a adult, you're like, shit. I got a DUI. I got on the DMV. The IRS is up my ass. I got a UTI. My IBS is kicking in. I might have an STD. Some kids like TMI. You're like, FU. Yeah, everything kind of changes when you get older. My brother had a kid. That's crazy. Everyone wants to play with the baby. Touch the baby. Hug the baby. I find babies fascinating. Because babies are the only thing that comes out of another person that strangers want to hold. You ever think about that? Anything else comes out of a human being or like, wow, this dinner party is over. But a baby we're all about. It's weird. We live in such a germophobic culture. A sneeze on a guy wants to kill you. But hey, have a giant monster. Good, good, good. Very interesting. Something to think about. You know? That's some perks to getting older though. I think older women are sexy. Anybody here been through menopause? Might be a younger crowd. I'm very eager when it comes to this stuff. You ladies really keep a lid on this shit. Like my aunt's going through menopause right now. She's bummed out. She's depressed. I thought that would be a good time. Mensrations over. Years of discomfort over. Come on. You graduated. Sisters. Time moved that tempo. You graduated. Sisters. Time moved that tempo on string of the side. Right. Why isn't that a party? Where's that Facebook invite? Hey, Amarie. Stop bleeding every month. All right. Everybody in the pool. All right. Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. There's too dark. And I'm just being myself here, folks. So people tell you to be yourself your whole life. That is the worst advice on the planet. Yourself sucks. Every time I'm in myself been fired, kicked in the balls, dumped, whatever. Don't ever be yourself. Yourself is gross and naughty. Self is the worst version of you. That's why whenever you walk in an elevator alone, there's no one else in there. You're like, ooh. I'm here by myself. I can be weird. Yeah. There's no one else in here. Yeah. All right. Then some other guy walks in. I got a bone herb and quafing. Ah, damn it. Yeah. You got to adapt. You got to go back to society, you know? And people tell you to be yourself with the worst times, too. Hey, you got a hot date tonight, Mark? Just be yourself. All right. You're sitting at dinner. Some girls like, so, Mark, what are you thinking about? I'm like, well, just thinking, you know. You rarely see any female pedophiles, which is probably for the best, because they can make their own kids. Just being me. The worst time. Hey, you got a job interview? Just be yourself. All right. You're in some office. Some guys going, so, Mark, what's your worst quality? Well, you know, I, uh, I always start masturbating when I'm already late for something. Huh. Wow. All right. Jesus Christ. Didn't see that one coming at all. Uh, quite a curveball there. Well, I got asked now, what's your best quality? Pretty fast, faster, better. I don't think we're gonna need you here at the Builder Bear. Thank you. All right. I like phony. Phony's underrated. Phony gets a bad rap, you know. Why is that like an insult? Like, I was a real phony. I love phony. Phony makes the world go round. Waiters? They don't care about you. They're being phony, and it's nice. The phony where they are, the more you tip. Nice hotel. Come on in, sir. We're so glad you came. I gotta give a rat's ass about you. He's being phony. We paid top dollar for phony. I don't want to strip who's authentic. Yeah. Getting a lap dance. I'm like, yeah, you like that. She's like, well, I'm just trying to get my kids back. Come back. Come back. Come back. Come back. Phony. Phony. Phony. Phony. I'm trying to do new stuff, trying to mix it up. I went to the Middle East. I performed for the troops. And I gotta tell you, that place sucks. I hate to sound like ugly American. It is rough over there. Holy hell. Very bleak. They're behind the times to say the least. They hate Jews. They hate Gays. They don't want women to drive. That one's not bad. I mean, it's rough. Rough over there. Holy moly. I was over there with a friend of mine, an openly gay comedian, very flamboyant guy. We almost got like 10 fist fights. Just walk around town. It's weird because the men over there hate Gays, but they also hold hands. So it's a weird thing for your brain to compute when you see it. You know, it's like, hey, get out of here, fat. I get to come on, Tom. You're gonna have both of those? Pick a thing. Yeah. Yeah. I got real bummed out. It was over there too long, man. I got so homesick that why not I googled the bald eagle? Yeah. True story. Fun fact. In the most common way, the bald eagle dies. It gets hit by a train. Weird, right? Swoopstowny dead carcass on the train track. It's so full, it can't fly away, and a train hits it. Yeah. What's more American than that? We've all been there. Hi. I'm like, hey, go to buffet, eat too much. You're like, ah, just fucking kill me. Yeah. They put all the performers up in this little condo and a little desert. It felt so unsafe, so nervous. I had no lock on my door. All I was a chain lock. Who feels safe with a chain lock? I hate the chain lock. I don't even get to lodge by in a chain lock. Like, yeah, I want to keep criminals out, but I also want to tease them. Give them a couple inches and tie some of that, you know? The chain lock seems more like a prank than a safety feature, yeah? Like the bad guy's the thing, hey, I think this guy left his door locked. Ah, what a rascal. Yeah. I hate to throw around the F-bomb any gay guys here tonight? Hey, all right. Yes. Thanks for coming out, literally. Yeah, all right. Love a good gay. My roommate's gay, that's fun. I like having a gay roommate. He's gay, I'm broke. I feel like poor people in gay people are a lot in common, you know? All right, both born that way. Yeah, women just want to be our friends. And when you finally tell your parents they're like, yeah, we knew. I went to the gay pride parade a couple weeks ago, still sore. Had a good time, yeah. They had the homophobic guys out there with the big signs, you know? How much you have to hate a group to make a sign? I'm never going to sign my whole life, huh? I feel bad, these people are more prejudiced and I am productive. And the marker is the poster board. I don't get a tactic for fighting gays as arts and crafts. Ironically, the group you hate the most really possess up that poster. Every sign, too, God hates fags. God hates fags. Like, really, that's all you got. God hates fags. That's not threatening. Who's scared of God? I'd be more scared of a sign said Bill hates fags. Like, shit, it's Bill here. That Bill. That Bill. That Bill. That Bill. Ah, that Bill. Bill's real. Yeah. Yeah. One creative guy, he'd assigned, he was against gays adopting kids. What a weird thing to be against. I like seeing a gay couple of the kids. You see a gay couple of the kid, he knows no way that kid was an accident. No gay couple could ever get that fucked up. Like, holy shit, what happened last night? Did we rob an orphanage? Jesus Christ. Holy hell. We got to lay off the mojitos. Woo. Yeah. Give gay couples kids. You know, he shouldn't have kids. Poor people. Why is that allowed? That's a terrible idea, right? My parents are poor, I'm a comedian. Red flag. So weird about kids in this country. You're gonna have a baby at 14. You gotta be 25 to run a car. 25 in a credit card. If a kid I need is a bone or in a commercial break. That's it. That's ridiculous. Hey man, I'm 24. Can I run a car? Now you gotta be 25. Yeah, but I have two jobs and three kids. Yeah, but a key of Cerento. That's a big responsibility, all right? Toshay, Abyss. Yeah. Oh man. I just got an email from a gay guy with a crush on me. Gorgeous gay man. Smoking hot. What a bummer I'm not gay. This guy is a 10, all right? A hot gay guy with a crush on you. It's kind of like finding a million pesos. And now you're like, oh man, I can't do much about this now. What if I ever crossed that line? I'll be set. Yeah. Yeah. We've come a long way with the gays. I have like a full 180 with gay people. Now you get as much throw being homophobic as you get gay 60 years ago. Now I was like, hey, mom, I'm gay. She's like, good for you. You're like, hey, mom, I'm homophobic. She's like, don't tell anybody. It's all flipped. It makes you wonder, where are the kids going to say now on the playground? Middle school. When I was a kid, gay was the number one insult. Where are these kids going to say, yeah? It's all different now. And now it's going to be like, look at Bill. Woo! He runs, like an unbelievable same sex marriage. Oh man, how about Bob? He's never blown a guy. What a pussy. Sometimes I wish I was gay, you know? I got fired from my last job for sexual harassment. I told a woman she had nice legs. They fired me. Which pissed me off because my gay friends were working with murder. The big, hey, Shelley, how are you? Huh, huh. What? Why is that okay? They're like, well, she's not attracted to women. I was like, so what? I'm not attracted to kids. I can't go to a playground. Hey, Timmy, yeah. I don't get stuff like that, you know? Like, you're a woman. Wouldn't you rather be complimented by a group that's into you? I don't care if a lesbian compliments me. Nothing gets lesbian, but that didn't help me out. Yeah? Have a lesbian's like, hey, Mark, like a haircut. I'm like, I know, you have the same one. I don't know, help me at all. Yeah. So when I was at the gay pride parade, you know? I went with a friend. Notice guy, 12 years, I had no idea what's gay. Blume my mind. He decided to come out of the closet at the parade. I had no idea what's gay. And when your friend comes out of the closet, the first thing you think is holy hell. How many gay jokes have I made around this guy? It's been 12 years, you know? That's a lot of jokes. And I had a guy in the crowd get mad and goes, what do you make gay jokes? What do you hate? Gays? I was like, no, you idiot. I just make fun of who's not around. I'm not prejudice, I'm a coward. Don't we all do that? When you wear the friend's belly, make fun of Jeff. When you're friend Jeff, you make fun of Bill. I don't hate them. They just weren't there. That's all right. People up calling you out of that. What do you make fun of black people? What do you racist? No. I don't see any. Right? I wish I didn't see you. Yeah. Brutal. Times were living. I feel like we're so quick to call everybody racist, homophobic, misogynist. You know? We're at race and we throw that around willy nilly. I was at a party once. I was like, that last name, that's Korean, right? Some guy goes, it's Chinese, you racist. I was like, well, I just got it wrong. I don't hate them. We don't do that with other stuff. What are those tulips? They're lilacs. You bought in the son of a bitch. All right. My eye on you. I love flowers. I have some. Yeah. Right? You can just say a race now and people get upset. There's no context anymore. I was at a show once, throwing a story. I was like, yeah, a friend of mine, black guy. Somebody actually yelled out, hey, why does he have to be black? Well, mostly his fucking parents. Ah. Pretty sure it's hereditary. Yeah. I don't get why we're so sensitive about certain groups and cultures. You know, like you can't make generalizations anymore. That's out. You know, but certain groups have different qualities, different traits. This is how we are. That's the fun part, you know. I made a hacky joke once about Mexicans and landscaping. This guy in the back goes, hey, not all of them. You're generalizing, buddy. Not all of them. All right. Fair enough. But how come they never do that on a positive generalization? They go, hey, Mexicans are very resilient people. And then we go, hey, not all of them. You're generalizing, buddy. You can do it with dogs. No one gets mad about that. You can go, hey, Chihuahua is shed less than gold or a treevers. I was like, yes, that's true. But if you say Italians, punch more women than Asians, they're like, oh, why are you mad at me? I'm just going off Google. I didn't do it. What did I do? Yeah. Man. Seems like the only grouping and make fun of now openly in public is children. That's it. You can say whatever the hell you want about kids. You're like, oh, I hate kids. Don't bring kids around. No kids allowed. I've killed a few. Yeah, I hate kids. Yeah. Say whatever you want about kids. Imagine a show called Juice of the Darnest Things. Right? That would never fly. It would be a great show though. Wouldn't it? How are you doing, Shlomo? We are chosen. Great show. Yeah. I guess you're allowed to make fun of kids because we all work kids at one point. That makes it easier. And I can't be like, hey, screw you. I was Mexican for 18 years. All right. Yeah. Get out of my hair. And I believe in equality and all that stuff. I just make jokes. What happened to jokes? I believe women should be paid the same as men, I do. I used to work at this office job one day. I walked in and swam was crying or eyes out. She's like, I saw the paychecks. I want to be treated like a man. I was like, well, you want to be paid like a man. You want to be treated like a man. We don't treat each other well. If you were treated like a man, some guy would walk in and see a crying. Be like, hey, suck it up, bitch. What are you doing? Oh my god. This Christ. Ray Chelsapasi. Ray Chelsapasi. It's like a man. What are you even saying? How we made him? How are you, vagina flick? That's what dudes are doing. What are you nuts? We'd have to get rid of sexual harassment laws open the door for titty twisters, credit cards, white, bang, grenade, bedding. Come on, ladies, you guys want to move furniture and kill spiders? Get out of here, right? And why would you? I don't either. We're very hung up on treating all the groups the same, but the differences of the fun part. We should embrace that. We do that with black people and white people all the time. You hear that a lot. You know, you should always treat black people and white people the same. No, you shouldn't. We should have the same rights. We shouldn't always be treated the same. That'll be insensitive. We all have different shit going on. Like, if I see a black guy, I love Jorion, his hat matches shoes. I'm like, hey, cool guy. If I see a white guy, I love Jorion, his hat matches shoes. I'm like, hey, he's gay. Differences. Differences. If I'm dry around my white friend and we get pulled over, I'm like, here's my insurance. If I'm dry around my black friend and we get pulled over, I'm like, I'll do talking. Thank you. It's true. If I see a white guy called a black guy at the end word, I'm like, well, it's going to get ugly. If a black guy calls me the end word, I'm over the goddamn moon. What a great feeling. Come on. Yeah. It bums me out. We're at a time now where you just mention a race and people get angry. It's like, well, why did you bring go to a bad place? It's never a good place. Like, I was at a show once. I was telling a joke. I was like, yeah, Jorion, a black guy at a Mexican walk-in-o-bar. It's guy goes, hey, hey, hey, I was like, screw you. Look at that diversity. These guys are hanging out. It's a hell of a bar. Beautiful thing. Never the good. But I'm so offended. Why is everybody so offended? What is that? That's the adult version saying, I'm telling. Oh, God. Gotta be very PC now. Those PC words. I'm all about progress. But why does adding syllables toward make it less offensive? You know? You used to be stupid and now it's learned disabled. You used to be retarded. Now it's mentally gay or whatever. I can't keep up with the PC, you know? It's all just a gesture. None of it means anything. Like, some PC I like, like Native American. That's good. He's not from India. Why are we calling it Indian? Native American. Great. I'll say that. Like, African American, I feel weird saying. I'm the African American friends. I have black friends. I have Caucasian friends. I have relatives. None of it adds up. We're all the African Canadians. Why don't we say that? Black people aren't in Canada every day. We don't know what the hell we're saying anymore. We're like, eat yourself. It was an amazing African American actor. Well, he's British. What the hell are we doing? It's just white people. We're nervous. We don't know what to say. We're scared. We don't want to get fired. We don't want to offend. You could corner a white guy on the sidewalk now with a microphone and a video camera. Like, what color is Ray Charles? He'd be like, uh, he's blind. What's his ethnicity? Pen-up-layer. What color is his skin? What color is his skin? What color is his skin? What color is his skin? What color is his skin? I got kids, man. Leave me alone. We're terrified. It's coming to my home now. I'm watching this coverage channel. Hey, it's a great white shark. Media-over-white. We're not long-great. I'm sorry. Oh, my God. It's bananas. It's out of control. I just don't get it. Why are we so obsessed with skin color? Why is skin the one part of the body you can't judge by color? They go, hey, yellow teeth. Gross. Redhead. Gross. Everything's judged by color. He's a black belt. He's blue collar. He's red state. He's got pink eye. All color. Why is skin so important? I think it's because you can't change skin color. You know, you can change your hair color trip to CBS. Hey, girlfriend comes on blonde one day. You're like, hey, look at that. You're girlfriend comes on black. You're like, what the hell happened? You can even change genders now. That's cool. Get surgery, take pills. Caitlin Jenner. What a hero. What was that chick? How much she was black? Rachel Dolezal? Yeah. Nice try, bitch. Come on. We all want to be black. Get in line, why'd he? All right. I can't just go black in your 30s. Get all the hard stuff. Too convenient. I can't just step over a press and be like, all right. I'll take that bigger dick. All right. You got to take the good with the bad, you know? I don't know. You still get, how do you hate a whole group? How do you hate a whole group? I don't get that. I hate specifics about people. You know, like people who drink rock star believe in ghosts and say, it is what it is. That's why I hate you. But racism is alive and well, man. I was just down in a Knoxville, Tennessee. You guys have been there? What a shit hole. Holy hell. They are 30 years behind over there. You have to go to a town so small, they're still racist towards certain white people. You know? They're like, hey, watch out over there. That's what the dirty Irish live. I was like, Jesus Christ. You guys haven't made it to black people yet? My God, you're far behind. I live in New York for past Arabs. Let's go. Pick it up. Come on. Yeah. And I'm from the South, too. So I've seen it all. South is a weird reputation. We're known for being racist and hospitable. It's a weird combo, huh? It's like every white guy sitting around in the South going, oh crap. A couple of black guys moved in the neighborhood. I got to make a pound cake. Yeah. Yeah. Very risky to make jokes now, very risky to be raped. Being racist now, very risky. You lose your job, get ostracized from society, make headlines. That's why if anyone's ever racist around you now, you know they trust you. It's kind of this weird, bitter, sweet moment, you know? You want to smoke break with somebody? He's like, oh man, I can't stand Mexicans. You're like, holy hell, you're full of hate. You're like, what's going on? You're like, what's going on? You're like, what's going on? You're like, what's going on? You're like, what's going on? You're like, what's going on? You're like, what's going on? You're like, holy hell, you're full of hate, but I didn't know we were so close. Just Christ. I feel like race and then smoke are a lot of like, you know? Like in the 50's everybody did it. Now we know it's bad. We're trying to cut back. But some people just can't quit. We should treat races the way we treat smokers. Now you're your day job. Some guys about to tell a racist joke are like, hey, take that shit outside, huh? Just a bunch of guys out in the cold. Oh God damn Jews. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I don't think those races break. I get cranky. Yeah. And they go to restaurants. How you folks doing? You want the racist section or non-racist? Well, we've had a few drinks. Better go racists. All right. Well, it's your funeral. The kitchen is heavily Hispanic. I saw a thing on the news yesterday about neo-Nazis. Yeah, neo-Nazis. What a crazy concept. Neo-Nazi. Do you really need the neo? You got Nazi in there. I think you're cool. All right. Also, we can do the math. You're 22. I know you're not like an OG Nazi. Yeah. Yeah. Also, you're a hate group. You're really a new hip name. Other hate groups don't do that. Hey, we're not the KKK anymore. We're KQ. Things are changing around here, baby. New sheets are great. Yeah. That's what we're at now. Everything's tense. White privilege. That's the term you hear a lot now. White privilege. I was at a grocery store with a friend of mine. Black guy. I stole a candy bar. I love to steal. I get a real rush from stealing. Yeah. I love stealing. What do you call that when you like to steal? What's the word for that? Klepto. Yes. What's the one we have sex with dead bodies? Necrophilia. Yes. I'm that too. Say, yeah. So, yeah. I steal the candy bar. I get outside. I'm all proud of myself. My friend goes, ah, white privilege. White privilege. I was like, ah, no. This was a robbery. If I had gotten caught, then got in a way with it. That would be white privilege. This is me being amazing thief. And he was like, nah, nah. It's white privilege because he got in and filed a story. He followed me around the store. And I was like, yeah, that's why I brought you. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Man. This wasn't diversity. This was a diversion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Man. Yeah. Yeah. That was a diversion. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, we got to keep up with the lingo. PC. The whole PC thing just feels very phony to me. It feels bullshit. Like, you can tell PC's kind of bullshit because you never use those words in emergency. It's too many syllables. People are heard. You got to help them. You don't have time to be progressive. You got to save some lives. Like, if you see a Chinese guy, get in a car accident. Run over a black guy. You can't be like, oh, my God. Officer, come quick. It's been a terrible tragedy. and Asian American man got no car accident. Knockers are bad drivers. And he ran over an African American gentleman who's crossed the street slowly. Knockers, they do that. And you gotta come quick. The guy's really hurt. He's drowning in a pool of his own blood. Knockers, they can't swim. All right. Now the guy's dead. You killed him. Thanks a lot. That's Mark Thorvin. Thanks for coming out. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Come. So easy. you
To be continued ... Hong, Hong, Hong, Gao, convection! I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back.... He's about to go all the way through. Oh, how? I'm getting chills looking looking looking. Thank you guys so much for packing out this place tonight. Thank you. And I know the question has already been asked. Why did Gabriel decide to shoot his new special in Hawaii? The question should be what took him so long. So the one thing I want to definitely make sure that happens here tonight is that I'm going to make sure that not only the people in the room here tonight that are not natives of Hawaii, but the people around the world find out things about Hawaii you never knew. First things first, the proper pronunciation is Hawaii. Just so the world gets to hear it right at least once. And believe me I understand exactly how you feel. I totally get it. For me it's not Mexico it's Mexico. I'm going to. Whenever people come to the island you know there's certain things people like to do aside from the surfing or the hiking or the traditional things. People always see the movies and the one thing that always stands out is the layout. People always see the little you always see the guy with the fire. You know he comes out and he makes a stance and you know. And I'm sitting with that looks cool. I want to let you guys know how you can tell if you're about to have a real genuine experience versus some of the more diluted things that have happened here on the island. Let me explain. If you're going to go for a luah make sure you do some research. Don't just go to Amy luah. I'm going to tell you how you can tell if you're on a battle run. There's always a bus involved that takes you from the hotel to the luah. That's a given. When you get on the bus there's a driver and there's always the person that's the host. If the host gets on the bus and you hear this. Hello and hello, everyone. Welcome aboard the King Kamehameh luah experience. My name is Reagan. I am not a native of Hawaii. I'm actually from Oregon. But I have been living here now for three weeks and you only need a few days and you're basically a native. We're going to have such a great time. It's going to take us exactly 35 minutes to get from here to our destination. I've timed it all week. Don't even worry about it. This is our driver. His name is Takah. Takah's been here on the island for over 75 years. He is so hardcore. He has taken a liking to me. He says I remind him of his daughter. He's so sweet. He calls me his little Poonani. He is so nice. So nice. So I have gone online to do some research to find out the type of conditions we're going to have today. And there is a slight chance of rain. Excuse me? Yes, sir. What happens if it rains? You have nothing to worry about. I took the liberty of stopping off in an ABC store and purchasing some umbrellas and some poncho. So we're covered. Excuse me? Yes, sir. Are we going to stop somewhere to get something to eat maybe or get some film? Absolutely. You have nothing to worry about. It's going to be the best time ever. Stay away from that door. This is how you know when you're on a real, low-ox experience. The driver, you know, is there the bus and then the guy gets on and you hear this. All right, everybody. Hey, brother. Turn it down. Turn it down, brother. All right, everybody. I'd like to welcome your board is we're going to Jermaine's low-out. Okay. My name is Reno. You could call me cousin Reno. I know. But don't worry, I'm not your real cousin. So don't ask for money, right? Yeah. Anyway, we're going to have a really good time today. It's going to be a great day here on the island. It's going to be beautiful. Excuse me? Yes, sir. How long is it going to take for us to get to the low-out? Actually, brother, he's going to, um, we're going to get there Hawaiian time. Yeah. What does Hawaiian time mean? What it means we get there when we get there. Pardon me, I have another question. Yes, sir. Uh, I understand it's going to rain today. What happens if it rains? Oh, you're going to get wet. Yeah. Excuse me, excuse me. Yeah. Are we going to stop somewhere to get something to eat or get some film? Hey, sit down, Mahu. Are you talking to me? Hey, Mary. I'm talking to your brother, sit down. And for the rest of the bus is one rain, what Mahu is. It means he really likes coconut. Yeah. Yeah, here we go. That was a good time. First things first. The best low out of go on, and they don't pay me to tell you this. I've been coming to the island for 10 years. The my favorite place to visit is Germain's Lou. Have you ever get a chance? They don't pay me to tell you that. And for the record, there is such a person as cousin Reed on. That's my man here in the front row. Stand up, brother. The man, the myth, the legend. Thank you, man. Thank you. With time and many, you know, coming here year after year and talking to people, certain words I've picked up, certain things I've learned. I finally figured out what shoots means. Anyone that gets to come here to the island, you'll hear people saying that shoots. And I found it, it means yes. Because, you know, because Mexicans, we have our own slang words too. You've heard me. Which is a term of excitement. It's like shoots. It means yes. But you should have heard the conversation I had. This guy was trying to explain it to me. I go, I keep hearing people say shoots. What's going on? Okay, brother. Let me break it down for you, all right? Shoots is like saying yes. Okay, cool. All right. So, let me see. So somebody says, you want to go to the store and I say, shoots. Roger that. Roger that. What does that mean? It means yes. So, shoots means yes. And Roger that means yes. Roger that. How would you, I mean, is there one that you use for one thing versus one that you use for another? Can you give me an example? No problem, brother. Check it out. Somebody tell me, hey, bro, you want to go get a drink? Shoots. Hey, bro, you want to go to the bar? Roger that. Roger that. I got it. I got it. I got it. I figured it out. And by the way, for all the people here on the islands tonight that are not native who are extremely light-complexed. Basically, for the white people. I just want to let you know, when you're hearing Hawaii, if you hear this word, howling, they're talking about you. Howling is the word to describe white people. And it's not a derogatory. I ask questions and it's not. It's just, you know, it has one guy. Where did howling come from? I don't know, and one guy said, well, bro, I think many years ago, some white people come here, right? They got drunk and they start yelling. YEEE-HA! Say, hey, somebody need to take down that howling right there. It's stuck. Trying to figure out howling, all right? But anyways, you guys, we've been traveling so many places. We've probably been in about 14 countries in the last two months. Yeah. I don't know. We're like herpes. We go everywhere. Twice a year. Anyway, that's bad, I know, right? You guys are so close, man. If I slip, that's it. His show was in 3D, but it hurt. It was terrible. It was terrible. So I gotta tell you, when we first kicked off our world tour, we started in Singapore. And for me, that kind of threw me on because just to let you guys know, they do speak English in Singapore. It's actually the number one language spoken, and I didn't know that. And some people are like, well, why would you go to Singapore to perform if you didn't know whether or not they understood you? Because the check was that. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And I'm a little whore. So yeah. The only thing with Singapore is that Singapore, the rules over there are very strict. Like many years ago, an American went over there and he was grafiting on a wall. Okay, he tagged up a wall and they got him. And they don't give out tickets in Singapore. The penalty for that was they pulled him aside, took off his shirt, and they camed him with a stick. And there's no set number, like, oh, you graffiti a wall with two letters, that's four licks. No, the guy hits you until he feels you've learned a lesson. Yeah, that's hardcore. If you're caught smuggling drugs into Singapore, the penalty is death, which makes somebody like myself nervous when you travel with the people that you travel with. Yeah. Yeah, my feet. Oh, yeah. And you know, it's crazy because they play a video when you're going through customs. As you're going through customs, they play a video to let you know where you're about to go into. And it starts off really nice. It starts off sweet. It's like, do you need me? Welcome to Singapore. Singapore, very beautiful country, very nice country, very clean country. If you're caught smuggling drugs into our country, I'll stop you! I'll talk to you! I'll knock you on the ground! I'll swat over you! I'll pee on you while doing gong, I'm style. I'll do that like that! Now, can you and kill you? Enjoy Singapore. From Singapore, we got to go up to London, England to do some shows. It was pretty cool over there, obviously they spoke English. The only issues that I had in London, England were that over there they drive on the opposite side of the street. And that is very, you know, that's kind of challenging for tourists because when you're crossing the street, you're automatically conditioned to come out, look left, look right, look left again, and then you cross. And so when you're there, you have to retrain yourself because you'll come out and you think you're cool. Look, there's no cars coming, let's go. Every other block is like the movie Final Destination. And over there they got double-decker buses. Those suckers are heavy. You get hit by one of those at 30 miles an hour. You know, at least if you get hit by a bus here on the island, you have so much of a chance. First of all, nobody's in a hurry. You get hit by a bus here. Hey, bra. Walk it off. You're okay. Shoops. All right. I've been to the new station here. I've been to the news many times and people always step off the curb and not paying attention to looking at the buildings or taking pictures. And you know, they report them. You know, a man was struck by a bus here today. His leg was broken. Doctors say he will be okay. London, England, getting hit by a double-decker bus going 30? A man exploded today. When he was struck by a double-jack of bus, we have video footage. Some of the places we're planning on performing this next year, we're talking about going to Germany, we're talking about going to Bulgaria, and India. India is on the list of new places we're going to visit. And I'm excited about India. You know, when I was telling people in England that we're going to India, I had Indian people telling me, oh, they're going to be amazing. When you go there, you can enjoy it. You're going to love it. It's amazing. And I just stare and the guy goes, boy, you're staring. Your voice doesn't match. Oh, you think we all sound like, I'm sorry. I live in America. Indians over there keep it real. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. And I have nothing but love and respect for Indian people. I'm going to tell you something right now. Indian people in the United States are the hardest working people I have ever seen. And that's coming from a Mexican, okay? And I'll tell you why I say this. You will never see an Indian person with a sign that says, we'll work for food in the United States. And you will never see an Indian person committing a crazy crime. Like when was the last time you heard of Indians robbing a bank? Everybody. I can't remember, bro. Because it doesn't happen. First of all, Indian people are so nice and they're so sweet. I can't see it. You know, you're going to rob a bank. You need authority. You need to come in their guns blazing. I said, get your ass on the ground. Now, I can't imagine. Would you please take the money? Why are you laughing? I am talking to you. Forget this. I'm out of here. I don't need this. He gets in the car. His partner's waiting for him. Did you get the money? They would not give me the money. Did you show them the gun? I showed them the gun! We better leave. They're going to call the police. They're still laughing. Why did you get the computer? They thought I was tech support. They thought I was tech support. They thought I was tech support. They thought I was tech support. There's too much fun, man. All these different countries. All these different places we've been going. And honestly, guys, it's not possible without the love and support of my family. They made that possible. Because I can't just go take off. You know, you really? Seriously? You know, you're just going to leave? It takes a strong woman, first of all, to put up with me. It's not... Oh, you're going to go travel the world with this crazy guy named Martin who's got tattoos and issues. Have fun. Oh, oh. It's not easy, you guys. Like I said, it takes a lot of love and support for my family. And right now, it's a crazy time because my son is 15. Okay? Some of you know I have a son from my last special. I talked about how he became a dad. And because he's technically my stepson. And the only reason I'm saying that is because he's been in my life for eight years. And he's 15. So I don't want you to look at me. And the math is all wrong. And you're like, he's ghetto. I'm not ghetto. I just hooked up with a beautiful woman who had a pre-started family which is why the math is off. Basically, I took over a lease as what happened. And everything's been going great. But when he turned 15, it started changing. Like he no longer talks to me, which is crazy. Not to say that he doesn't seem in agnostic. He just doesn't talk. And I thought it was personal. And his mom is like, no, he's going through a face. Like he doesn't speak. He makes sounds. Frank, he how's your day? Did you take out the trash? Oh! Like, wow. Like the only person he talks to is at the other end of his phone. Because that's all he does. All day, just text, text, text. And it's funny because he's always like this texting. And when he walks around, he takes little steps so that in case he bumps into something, it doesn't hurt. Like he's like a little vacuum, you know? And then... And then... You know? And when he's taking these little steps, he makes these sounds. And his tongue comes out half way. It looks freaky. Like he's trying to text with it. And I asked his mom, is he okay? He's going through a face. And I could totally understand my son standing in the corner for 15 minutes at his time with his tongue out, making noises if he was a special circumstance. But he's not. Okay, if he was, I'd hug him and love him the same. But he's not. He's a straight-A student in his school. He's at the top of the list in his class as one of the smartest kids. And it's... No, no, no, no, no, no, don't clap. Don't clap. You know why? You know why? Because on paper, it says he's a genius. But at home... It doesn't match. And don't get me wrong, you guys. I believe the good grades are important, okay? But you would think with all the different classes that they offer in school, how come they don't have a class called Common Sense? You know what I mean? Make it the easiest class they have ever taken. Make it so easy that it's the exact same class every single class they have ever taken. That's the exact same class every single day. They don't pay attention anyway. Make it the same. Hello, class. Welcome to Common Sense. Let us begin. Up, down, left, right, hot, cold. Take a shower. Take a shower. Take a shower! I don't know what happened when he turned 15. He forgot how to play with water. Oh my God, and for me, you guys smell so important. It is so important. You know how many people I meet every single year? I am so self-conscious. I don't want anyone to smell me that I meet and all of a sudden have them say, Fluffy smell like ass. Hell no. I know I'm a big guy. That's why I do double the maintenance. Twice the showers, twice the cologne, twice the odour, twice the powder. If I fart right now, this whole area will smell like cinnamon. That's how I roll. You guys will be looking at each other. Is that cinnamon? Yes, canela, canela, canela. He smells like amalazadas. Yes. What's amalazadas? It's a ball of dough with good stuff in it, wrapped in cinnamon. Taste delicious. Anyway, like I said, you guys, for me smell is so important. You know, and the fact that my son at 15 now is, his body is becoming an adult, even though he's... And I try to tell him. And he always forgets and blah, blah, blah. And it wasn't until his PE teacher called us up and told us that what he was doing is he's leaving his PE shirt in the locker over the weekend instead of bringing it home to wash. And so that shirt just broils and simmers in those kid juices. And then on Monday when he puts it on, it's all hard and yellow and just, you know, nasty. And they told us your son is smelly. And I'm like, oh hell no. I took his ass to the store and I bought him a 10 pack of that right-guard gel with a little click on the bottom. And I showed him, frankly, look, look, look, look, look. Every day, twice a day. That's what you got to do. And every day it's an issue. Did you put on the odorant? Ah. I went back to the store and I bought 10 more. And I came back to the house and I started strategically placing them all over the house, one in the front, or one at the back, or one in the hallway, one in the kitchen. So no matter where he's at, hit it, right? He hated that because the neighbors would come over the house and I'd have to explain why there's deodorant everywhere. Like it's a new type of pulpore. And then he starts hiding the deodorant and then he starts lying about it. And I'm like, I'm sorry, but teenagers can't lie. They're too fidgety, they're uncoordinated, they look away, they stutter. They can't focus. I asked them, did you put on the odorant? Hmm? Are you sure? Yeah. Come here. I'm going to smell you. You don't believe me? No. That sucks. Are you wearing the gel deodorant that I bought for you? All right. Take your finger, stick it under your armpit, and then pull it out. Why? Because if you're wearing the gel deodorant that I bought for you, when you pull your finger out of your armpit, your finger's going to be shiny. It's going to look like you have lubricant on it. What's that? Shut up. And then he tells me I'm wearing dry deodorant. Oh, really? I don't remember buying that. And I got in his face and I said, look, Frankie, you don't have to lie. I'm here to help you. I'm not here to hurt you. I said, do you like girls? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, good. Well, guess what? They don't like it when you smell. They like it when you smell fresh and clean. You don't have to lie. I'm going to let this go. But if I catch you lying to me again, that's when he freaked me out and he did this. What? And my head, I heard. Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on. And I'm not a violent person, bro. I'm not violent, but, eh, it's kill or be killed, right? You know? And seriously, you guys, I would never put my hands on my son. And people judged me for that. Oh, you wouldn't hit your kid. You think he's going to call the cops? I don't care if he calls the cops. I'll call the cops. Anyone who's ever seen my specials knows I've had a few run-ins with law enforcement. Okay. And because of one joke where I went to a crispy cream drive-through, are you kidding me? I have become law enforcement's favorite comedian. In the state of California, alone, I've done over 50 shows for the California Highway Patrol. Los Angeles Police have been taking over in California for the last three years. They're taking advantage of those who have been in the state for the last three years. I think it's not that bad. for the California Highway Patrol Los Angeles Police Department, Long Beach Police Department, where I live, I can call a cop right now to go to my house and hold down my son while my girlfriend kicks him. That's how connected I am. I'm not worried about him calling the cops. I'm worried about him calling TMZ. That's why I'm afraid. Oh, yeah, TMZ finds out I beat my son. Are you kidding me? They'll have me on TV the next day. Uh-oh. Looks like chocolate cake isn't the only thing he beats up. So I told my girl what happened. I said, listen, baby, he's lying to me, and he's chesting up. I don't want to have to get physical with him, but I will if I have to. I'm not going anywhere. And see, my girlfriend's different. My girlfriend will actually choke him. I'm not going to lie. She's a little ghetto. Kind of hot. Oh, man, I left town for two weeks to go do some shows. And when I came home, it was night and day. They picked me up at the airport. He jumps out of the car and he's holding the door open like he's valet. And I get in the car. I look at my girl. What's going on? He thinks you're still mad at him, so he's being extra good. We're going to ride this out. LAUGHTER And the whole drive home. He's doing that little song in the back seat. I'm going to clean the room. I'm going to take out the trash. I'm going to walk the dog. I'm going to do the dishes. And when we got home, he did all of it. And I was like, wow. And then we're passing each other in the hallway. And as we're passing each other, he sticks out his arm, bro. And he tap me. And he keeps walking. And I go, excuse you. And you go, whatever. Oh, by, let me take this opportunity to tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a decent person. I'm not great. I'm not horrible. I'm decent, okay? Anybody who's ever met me in the past or will meet me in the future, you know what I'm saying? Hey, I know what's in my heart. I'm a nice person. And if I'm being nice to you and you mean to me, I'll still be nice. But if you're mean to me a second time, I don't care who it is. It could be one of you guys. It could be one of my friends in the back or it could be the new dependent on my taxes. You mess with me. I'm going to mess with you back. And I'm going to step it up a notch so you don't forget. And everybody's quiet. All the kids are like, I don't want to meet him now. Let me tell you what happened. Next morning, I was in my son's room. And I'm standing over his bed. It's 5 o'clock in the morning. And I'm just watching him sleep. I know it look creepy like the movie. And I'm just thinking, what am I going to do to get even, right? And I look over and I see his alarm clock. And I'm like, perfect. Just so you guys understand, it's his job to wake himself up for school. And he knows if he's late because he didn't set that clock. His mom is going to have his ass. He's afraid of his mom for good reason. So I grab that clock and I change a time from 5 a.m. to 730. And it gets better than I set it off. And I grab him. Freak, wake up, wake up, wake up. And he wakes up all scared. What? What? Look at your oversight. Look at your oversight. And he freaked out. Oh my god. Shh. I'm going to help you. And I started handing him his clothes. Here, get your dress. Get your quits your clothes. He's getting dressed in the dark. He looks like a little drunk. Your children. And I grab him and I drag his ass into the garage. His whole face is oily and sweaty. He's got rocks and crust in his eyes. He has a perfect white line going all the way to the back of his neck. As soon as I get him in the car, falls asleep. I jump in and I take him to school. We get to his school. The sun is barely coming out. There is not a kid for miles. As soon as we get by the office, I slam down the brakes to wake him up. Anyway, freaky the belgias ring. Hurry. The last kid went in. You're going to make it go. Hurry, go. OK, thank you. All right. I love you. It was Sunday. Kid messed with you. You messed with Kid. Nine-o'-lotter you ran out of your like, oh, you went back to get him, right? That wasn't the plan. He starts calling my phone. He'll forget him. Look at the phone and it's an old picture when he was still cute, you know? I sent him the voicemail. I look at the phone and I see his mom's face. I'm like, shit. Little trainer. We're trying to play it off in the car. Hello. Pick him up. I can barely hear you. Pick him up. I get back to the school, big old freaking school with one kid in front of it. Aw, man, you guys, he was so pissed off, but I'm going to tell you something. I found something out that week. I found out that you don't have to yell at a kid to get your point across. You definitely don't have to hit one. All you really have to do to make sure they never forget the day that they messed up is embarrass them. Embarrassing a kid is the biggest weapon you can have as a parent that's legal. And so much more effective, you guys. Because I'm going to tell you right now, between the ages of 10 and 19, it's all about image. It's all about, do I have the cool shirt, the cool hat, the cool wristband, the cool watch, the cool glasses, the cool shoes, the cool pants. They want to fit in so bad. You mess with their image at school. Oh, it's mental. It's emotional. And depending on what you did, it's physical. LAUGHTER Why do you think they make such a big deal about bullying in schools and child abuse amongst each other? Because when kids turn, it's not pretty, especially if they have a reason to. Like finding out that you got dropped off on Sunday by your dad because there was a janitor that were working who saw the whole thing go down. And three days is what it took for word to get out. And when those kids found out it was my son, the things they said to him were so bad that when he came home, he was in tears, OK? And I'm not going to let you guys, I felt terrible for like a second. It was bad though. It was. I was moved. He came in all hard. Oh, Brad me. Oh, Brad me. All day long, people been messing with me. It's Sunday kid. It's Sunday kid. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Get him a calendar. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Get him a watch. Why are you just standing there? Say Sunday! Put on the order. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE I'm not going to lie, you guys. I think deep down he wishes that I would hit him because it would be faster. But that's not how I roll. Oh, no. And I got to give credit to his mom, you guys. His mom allows me to be a dad. You know, as a step parent, it's not easy. You can't just come in and run things. It takes time. If you come into that house and you start trying to yell at people and start trying to, no, no, they'll jump all over you. You can't be doing that. Don't go, hey, you tell me what he did. I'll handle it. You don't do anything. LAUGHTER You're like, oh, I've been there, bro. Yeah, all right? Next thing you know, you're in the corner crying when that kid is supposed to be. It's a hazing process in the beginning. Everybody's pushing each other's buttons. Everybody's testing each other. Is this guy really going to stick around? That's what happens. And after eight years, hey, my credit is good. So, I'm going to have to pay for it. I'm going to be there, I'm going to be there. Hey, my credit is good. So, my girl backs me up whenever I make a call. She backs me up. Don't get me wrong. If I make a bad call, she's going to call me on you. If I mess up, she's going to point it out. She doesn't think that all my ideas are good ones. And there's been a few times when I've messed up as a dad. Like one night, I got really, really drunk on the road with my theme. LAUGHTER And I don't know what happened. I started drunk texting Frankie. I don't know what it is about me getting drunk for some reason. The phone just... Ah! LAUGHTER And my girl found out about it. And when I got home, I knew something was up because she called me by my first name. And we haven't used first names in years. You know, since then, it's always been pet names. You know how it goes? You know, honey, baby, sweetie, suce, yes. Something that kind of just... Some of you got that? Good, that's yes. Anyway. LAUGHTER I walk in the door and I hear Gabriel. And I'm like, oh, I'm in court. LAUGHTER And here she comes out of the back. I understand when you're out there. You're going to do what you're going to do. You want to get drunk? Fine, get drunk. You want to text me while you're drunk? Fine, text me while you're drunk. Do not ever drunk text my son again. How do you know who's drunk? Really? LAUGHTER Frankie, come here. Bring your phone. LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Look at this message that came in at 417 AM. Put on the otherant fucker. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE That's a nickname. LAUGHTER No, no. I got to give her credit. Anytime I mess up, she is very creative on how she approaches me. Like the latest thing that she does is she no longer wants to deal with me face to face. What she does is she will find one of the three dogs that we have in the house. And she will start carrying a full-blown conversation with the dog. Telling the dog what I'm doing wrong is a man. You have to understand how demeaning this is to me, okay? I own Chihuahua's. And you mean to tell me two pounds of terror is going to take over and mean... No, no, no, no. And I'll tell you what happened, you guys. I was actually innocent. I was actually innocent. I didn't do anything bad, but it looked bad. I had three shows one night. And after the third show, I was exhausted. So I go on the back to lay down for a little bit and I fell asleep. And I woke up and it was four hours later. And I reached out and I pulled out my phone. My phone was still in my pocket and it was in silent mode. And I looked at the screen and the screen said 27 missed calls. From... I wonder who? There is not a text in the world that's going to fix that. There's not a phone call that I'm going to make at four o'clock in the morning that's going to make this better. I'm screwed no matter what. So I shut off my phone. Yeah, look at all the girls are like, that's where you really messed up. I know. I didn't know you could die twice. Apparently you can't. So I come home, you guys. And I know I'm innocent. So I'm not showing up at the front door with flowers or trying to be... No, no, no, no. I know I'm good. So I show up, comfort it. I walk in and I said, baby, let me just explain what happened to me this weekend before you say anything. And then she starts, oh. Look who's here, Bruno. Look who's here. Daddy's home. Now daddy wants to talk to us. Funny. Talk to Bruno. Let me explain. He thinks we're playing, huh? Really? You're not going to talk to me? You're going to talk to the dog? Somebody's getting frustrated, huh? Kind of like we were frustrated when he didn't pick up his phone, yes he did. She will not look at me. She will not talk to me. She continues to do this for ten minutes. After ten minutes, she has me doing it. I'm sorry. Okay. Bruno! Bruno! Now she thinks I'm making fun of her. Are you mocking me? Now I'm pissed off because now she's screaming in my face so that I was like, oh, she thinks we're mocking her, huh, Bruno? Mommy should have played this game because we can play it better, huh? Yeah, because I can make you talk back to me, huh? That's a ton, though. Yes, I can. Because you love me more. A lover? Mommy's crazy, huh? This is a bitch. Come on. And that started a whole different argument. Oh, my God, you guys. And I don't want you to think into my girlfriend's a bad person. She's an amazing woman. The fact that I only have seven stories about her in eight years says a lot. Don't get me wrong. Five of them happened this year. But that's still way below the bar. And I get questions. I get questions about her. Because in the past, I've done specials and I've talked about other people in my life. I've talked about my mom, I've talked about my dad, I've talked about my sisters, my brother. I've talked about Frankie. I've never really talked about my girl. And so I get people that ask me, we want to know a little bit more. First question that everybody always asks is, is your girlfriend fluffy too? And no, she's not. She's a little bit curvy, but she's not fluffy. And it's not to say that I have anything against big women. Most of my ex-girlfriends were really big girls. When we would hug, it was like arms and pillows. Oh yeah, it was that temper-peedic love. You know what I'm saying? It was hardcore. Like we would hug really, really hard. And then let go. And then our body would come back to normal. Another question that people ask is, is your girlfriend also Mexican? You know, is your girlfriend Mexican? And yes, she is, but that doesn't mean anything. Because I have dated the rainbow. Okay? I just wear a landed. You know, I just, you know? Oh, look. Just wear a landed. The crazy part with my girl is that she doesn't have traditional Mexican features. She could pass for white. Which is funny because the first time I introduced her to my mom, it was quite the show. I take my girl to go meet my mom for the first time and You know my mom she she'll come to the door she'll come to the door if you know she you know She sees you pulling up in the driveway. She opens the door and just waits for you to get there and greets you at the door So I'm pulling up right gets to you know she comes to the door She sees me opening the door and this white girl comes out And she starts cussing me out from the door And my girl speaks Spanish so my girl looks at my mom and she's like oh less than you're at comestas and my mom was like oh my god Oh my god, oh so sorry, huh? You see that mom you see that mom they make them in that color too Another question that I get about my girl is um, how did you guys meet? Did you meet at a show and actually no we didn't meet at a show we met at a bar And see somebody A lot of people don't like that one. They're like oh really a bar. That's not a good way to meet someone It's an honest way to meet someone We were both drunk when we met Which I find ironic considering she has issues with me drinking now You know eight years later the way I see I'm just keeping it real you know those hey man Yeah But no she don't see it that way when we met I was gone she was gone We started talking to each other and at the end of the night I was like wow you have issues You're messed up too We went to go get a bite to eat and then you know nine months later we moved in together And then it worked out for us. I tell people you want to find out who you're with Don't just rush into the relationship right away like you see some of those people after a month We knew it was meant to be Yeah a year later he changed She's not the same. He changed. She's not the same. He changed People don't change. I'll tell you why it looks like they do because in the beginning of the relationship You do whatever you have to do to make it work and the first thing you do is you bite your tongue All of your freaking issues and things that bother you you check your own morals because you want to make it work You start weighing out the pros and the cons They're like oh man. She talks a lot but look at that butt Oh man her family's kind of crazy, but they got money You know so you start weighing things out that's why it looks like the person changed that you're later And I'm just saying you guys if you don't feel like investing a lifetime trying to figure out who you're with Just do what I did and get drunk with the person But don't just get drunk to get drunk get drunk with the intent I'm getting as much real information out of them so that you can make an educated decision on whether or not to be with them Make it fun Make it a game. This is what you don't know. This is what you do you sit across from each other You make a list of five things you have to know before you become exclusive Then you break open a bottle of tequila or alcohol of your choice You do 10 shots each you wait 35 minutes you turn on a flip cam hit record and let the date begin You're about to find out who you're really dealing with make it fun. Okay, Jennifer. Um, you go first. Thank you, Jonathan. Thank you. Okay, question How am I Okay Okay How many people have you slept with and guys can lie but the face gives it away how many Two Have you ever cheated? No Oh Next day you pull up that video and you confront them and you can see for yourself who you're really dealing with and if you can see that they're lying Call them out. Jonathan. This is the saddest thing I've ever seen It is so obvious that you're lying. There's no way in hell. I'm ever gonna be with you Why don't you just be a man and tell the truth? How many people have you really been with? Oh man Over 20 over 20 I've never cheated. Oh god. I cheated on everybody How could you do that? How could you cheat? How could you cheat? I was my last then Oh Is some of your clapping summer laughing summer like it's still not funny I'm not making fun of mullet station. I'm only making fun of the fact that Alfred said it It's all tense now some people over there. No, they gotta go pee go ahead go pee go ahead They're freaking out. Hello. I'm not TV. I'm right here I told the venue to I said you know what they got to do for the special they got to put speakers in the bathroom under the toilet So when people get up like that to go pee I can mess them up and go Welcome to the rest room If you need to go pee pee please you stall number one if you need to go po po please you stall number two. Thank you Yeah Like a to the rest through Hell yeah, that's what I'm saying if you need to pee you stall number one if you need to shit take your nasty ass home So some of your laughing something like stop doing those voices Just having fun. That's all I gotta tell you guys being a comedian has been the uh one of the greatest experiences for me and uh You know, it's it's been a it's been a fun ride. It's been a fun ride and um a lot of people don't understand what has gone into this You know me personally. I got a lot of people to thank my family obviously first and foremost and all my friends and all the support And all the people you don't see that are behind the scenes that have helped me and there's a lot of comedians up there They do really good and for some reason they start you know going crazy and things happen and then what happened wrong people around them So whenever you see me you're like oh gay was keeping it together because people keep me together You know, I start believing my own hype. I'm at 7-11. Yeah, give me all that shit. Yeah. Yeah. Keep me slurping. Give me crazy Why is she talking to me like that? I don't know Just want you guys to know It's been a fun ride and I want you to understand a little bit more of what has happened over the years to get to this point For the first I'd say the first 10 years of my career. I was considered a southwest comedian by promoters Meaning that they would only promote me in California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, you know, New Mexico Nothing wrong with that But here's the thing is that they were calling me a south was comedian and then they call me latino comedian and I hated that no No, I hate that I'll tell you why and I know you have good intentions when you will let me explain why don't like that title When you say latino comedian it makes it sound like I can only perform for Latinos Okay, and don't get me wrong. I know who I am and where I come from But I believe that Latinos should be shared with everyone and that's what I'm trying to do and the reason why I make a big deal about that is because anybody else You just call them their name for example Jerry Seinfeld He's just Jerry Seinfeld. He's not Jewish comedian Jerry Seinfeld Chris rock is just Chris rock. He's not African American comedian Chris rock But with me I was always latino comedian or fat comic Yeah, they wouldn't even call me fluffy those bastards And so it wasn't until years and years of grinding it out that eventually I wound up meeting a promoter Who eventually became my manager who took a chance on me and he promoted me in Minneapolis, Minnesota Okay, and you cannot get any wider than Minneapolis, Minnesota That is where the howlies are built That is the howly factory okay as Minneapolis, Minnesota And it was a venue about as big as this and it was it was sold out and word got back to Los Angeles and to New York and to all these promoters That there's this entertainer with the last name Eglaceus who sold a bunch of tickets who was not Enrique Next thing you know promoters are coming up the woodwork now they're changing their tune now They're not calling me latino comedian anymore now they're saying oh this guy's he's funny across the board He's crossover. He's so crossover his material touches everyone. He's crossover. He's crossover really you're gonna call him Mexican crossover It was getting worse All I wanted to do was be given a chance to go out and perform and show what I could do and not have restrictions and titles and stuff But on it was very very hard and so like I said once I met my my buddy who took care of me and came my manager Joe Milage amazing work He started taking me everywhere with the help of him and my agent Matt Blake and comedy central started backing me up We wound up hitting all 50 states next thing I know we go to Canada next thing I know they sent me to Europe next thing I know we hit Australia and then I get this phone call My agent calls me up, but he says gave check it out You're getting a request to perform in the Middle East I go really okay cool army Navy Marines Air Force who Actually the request is coming from a prince run that by me again a prince I said Preparing Not prince a prince I Said how do they know me? I don't know but they say that they know you and they want to hire you I go it sounds like a joke Matt trust me it sounds legit all right if it's legit I'll tell you what give whoever a ridiculous figure and let them know that they have to wire the money today Otherwise forget it Four hours later gave what ridiculous just called Are you serious I'm looking at the screen bro. They wired all of it next thing I know Welcome aboard Saudi Arabian Airlines I Seventeen hour flight you guys from Detroit Michigan to re-ad Saudi Arabia and just so you guys know I didn't go by myself Okay, I took some friends with me Nobody from this show For obvious reasons Man I use the crew that I travel with everybody's hairy big nose go-t beard crazy eyes this are you kidding me with the all of us?

This is like the movies And they pulled us off the plane and they escorted us to this area called VIP baggage claim and it sounds kind of great VIP and I get there and I realize all their their serving cookies and candy and coffee and There's leather sofas and it's really nice and there's nothing but Middle Eastern businessmen there, okay? And they're all talking about me I don't understand Arabic but everyone in this room understands when someone's talking about you The guys looking at me and he's like Hey But this is And apparently this is Arabic for So then this other guy walks over to me and he's holding a sign and the sign has my name on it And he's really excited. He's like it is you come come come You did you come come come come and on all kiko so we grab our luggage and we follow him outside to the curb They have three link and navigator SUVs waiting for us There's three comedians and there's three cars We're so paranoid that we're in the Middle East we all get in one car We sitting in there And we take off we're heading towards downtown Riyadh, okay?

I couldn't get over that I honestly thought that they were gonna be like the people from Fox News And I felt terrible. I felt terrible because I was judging them I was prejudging them and I thought that they were gonna be a certain way and I felt bad because all those years People were doing that to me not really giving me a chance and I was over there doing the same thing I felt so bad and then when I met the prince I was still judging 19 years old and he's a prince. I thought he was gonna be a brat He walks up to me and I was already like I Failed to realize that he's a prince and he was brought up to be a prince The way he carried himself he intimidated me in about 18 seconds Okay, I'm 36 and I mean, oh what's up and he's like Gibriel Excuse me Gibriel Gibriel Gabriel I understand that your name is Gabriel but in the Arabic language your name is Gibriel I was welcoming you in our language I'm a dick And I started already imagining what was gonna happen Ah Jebriel I'm so sorry.

I am not getting invited to a palace by a prince Oh my god up until this point my only experience with royalty was a burger king drive through All of a sudden one of those SUVs pulls up And a guy jumps out in a suit and I guess his favorite word was please because that's all he said please Please Please Please Please Are you kidding me? There's a man in a suit trying to get me in the back of a Lincoln navigator And there's a prince inviting me to his palace. I'm not gonna lie. I felt like a hot chick I don't know. Oh my god.

There's bob wire around the entire property and there's two guys in the front with machine guns I'm looking at this and I'm like this doesn't look like a palace And I started thinking what if I'm on some messed up episode of Middle Eastern Punt You know what I mean like you don't do go to palace you go to prison you're a bountie You Fortunately the doors opened up and we drive in and then they closed and when we get outside you guys What we saw was amazing outside desert inside?

I'm like are you kidding me snakes monkeys a zebra and a tiger? Oh my god that makes me kung fu panda And I started thinking what if he decides to keep me It sounds messed up, but let me explain As an american you cannot just purchase an airline ticket to go to Saudi Arabia You have to be invited by a person of power You know when I left Detroit to go over there I had to fill out a form that says I understand that I'm going to Saudi Arabia and should something happen to me One of those things on the list being kidnapping conveniently right above death America is not responsible the prince could have actually your mind Two weeks later now he's showing someone else around right It is my snake. I think it's my zebra. I think it's my Mexican. I think it's my tiger He said a some little box. This is gibriel But it never happened and we're walking around and I actually pulled him aside for a second I said listen up. I got to tell you something. Well you tell me I need to apologize. What did you do? I didn't do anything I just want to apologize for coming here with the wrong mentality. I says unfortunately. I thought that Just you know because it is the Middle East. I thought you guys were gonna be rude and everybody's been nothing but nice Ah, I know I didn't think you guys were gonna speak English so well and understand you know so many references and you guys get everything Ah, I know I thought you guys were gonna throw rocks But you were funny What What never mind Twitter three where So we're walking and He's showing me this and that and we're just kind of like looking around I thought it was great and then I saw something that freaked me out We're walking in the direction of a giant cage and when I saw the cage I stopped oh like Oh, what's with the cage? Take a look great So I walk over towards the cage and I look inside and I notice that there's birds in there and I'm like oh, okay Cool, it's a bird cage. You got off-fland area.

I understand medallist hostage hahaha Okay, all right So the other guy comes out and he's got a falcon with him and he's got a glove and he hands me the glove and I put it on and he transfers his falcon to my arm And uh all of a sudden he starts doing snapping things and he's basically showing me that the falcons trained and I thought that was Graph I thought we're gonna kill something. I'm like no, but we're just playing with the falcon and I started getting excited You know and the more excited I got the more the prince started showing his age Because then he got excited.

I said I'll tell you what we got two hours to kill how about this how about we go to the supermarket And we make an actual racist gift basket and we'll have it delivered and we'll wait outside to see what happens. I said are you down? We go to a store and we start to design the sickest practical joke ever I get a shopping cart and I'm like all right We need a basket so I find one I take out the grass the plastic gags in the chocolate rabbits and we start hitting the aisles First item my grab is a fried chicken about that big Hey See how quick that laugh was So a few black people in here like mother fucker this better be funny It's hysterical let me just finish the store and then you could judge me in the parking lot So anyway, then Martin hands me a miniature watermelon and I put it next to the fried chicken Here's where it gets interesting Employees of the store find out what we're doing and they start volunteering to help us finish the basket Half of the employees were black which made it so much more accurate Isle after isle I one guy was stocking a shelf he was an older white guy and we're like sir Can you help us? What do you need my buddy? Martina and I are trying to make this messed up racist gift basket for our black friend as a practical joke Can you think of something we can put in there without even blinking and I the guy was like ah you gotta have cool aid Set the end of the aisle on the right malt liquors the next trail over in the back of the store in the freezer section It's on sale too for one by the time we get to the register all these different employees plus us came up with the basket that had Fried chicken watermelon cool-aid great soda barbie cupatadol chips sunflower seeds and ebony magazine a Chris rock DVD called bigger and blacker Magnum condoms new port cigarettes a rack of ribs the recipe for cornbread It was getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger Icing on the cake we find a greeting card that's on clearance from Halloween And it has a picture of three ghosts on the cover wearing sheets I tear off the half that says happy Halloween and on the back of the card I write welcome to Fresno love the chamber of commerce And we stick it to the basket we made it all nice and pretty and we haul ass to the hotel We pull up We walk in the basket is hot as hell so I'm racing in I get inside and I put it on the counter as fast as I can bro. It's too perfect There's a black girl behind the front desk As soon as I put the basket down I hear Is that chicken Oh, let me see hold on what is it let me explain my name is Gabriel This is my theme we're a couple of comedians and we're about to play a really crazy practical joke on a friend of ours Who's staying here tonight by the name of G Riley who's also a comedian All the one is on the signs on the freeway. Yeah, the one is on the signs on the freeway So as a practical joke we went to the store and we made this messed up racist gift basket. That's that's why you can smell fried chicken And she was like You need Jesus that's what you name Okay Girl you better hang up that phone you ain't gonna believe what I'm looking at over here girl Listen we think it would be hysterical if we could have you deliver the basket for us She lost it. Oh the hell you didn't I Know you didn't just ask me to take that to a black man.

She's a beautiful black woman standing there with a gift basket. This is for you, baby He says thank you Closes the door She walks the way and she sees us on the ground hiding right and she's like y'all still going to hell We get up and we walk over to the door and we put our ear listen This is what we hear inside Woo chicken Y'all cool late Monica he's getting excited over every single item. He's pulling out of the basket He gets to the greeting card. What can a phrase no love the chamber of commerce hell yeah Then we feel him flipping the card over because his voice changed He's like oh yeah man. Is it what the fuck Outside the door we heard racist bastards Well, we heard racist bastards. We lost it Oh We're laughing we're crying we got boogers coming out. We can't take it anymore. We knock on the door He yells who is it too easy chamber of commerce He rushes the door. I put my finger on the people so we can't see who it is right the knob starts The jiggled and the door explodes open and he's like what and he sees us and he's like What's up jeez man don't give a brother a heart attack Did you like your basket man that was messed up? Did you like it man? I love all that shit And now ladies and gentlemen a story that has been seven years in the making I would like for you to now hear for the first time ever The other side of that story Ladies and gentlemen, I flew him here to Hawaii so that he can share this with you Give it up for my friend mr. G I got beyond I didn't know it was racist. I thought it was lunch I Thought it was lunch. I didn't know it was racist until I got back to my neighborhood brothers in my neighborhood Looks at me they say man. I don't believe you let that Mexican guy do that to you man That was messed up. I know you got them back. I said what buy him lunch. I can't afford to buy that man lunch If I if I buy him lunch, he'll be getting me again But you gotta understand it was the perfect set of circumstances when it happened Because I'm laying across the bed in the hotel I had never been to Fresno before and I wanted something to eat and I didn't know where to go eat So I'm laying across the bed and I'm saying to myself, where can I go eat? I wish I had some food and all of a sudden magically This is not on the door and a black girl shows up with a gift basket And I took the gift basket and I said they know how to treat that comedians up here And I'm walking to the bed and I can feel a heat and I can smell the chicken from the gift basket And I'm like oh this is cool. Good nobody smells chicken and thinks the racism I get to the card and I look at the card and I go what the fuck is going on I said oh my god, I'm working for the Ku Klux Klan And I really I really started to panic because in my head I'm saying to myself is this for real because then with billboards all over the city with my picture And I started thinking they were trying to scare me out of town So now I don't know what to do right now I started trying to call a promoter and the promoter's not answering the phone And it's festering in my head and I'm nervous and I'm pacing the room and all of a sudden There's a knock on the door right now go oh my god, they come to get me So I so I ease over to the door right and I look through the people who are right and all I see is a brown dot And I go I hear somebody out there because I hear the breathing right out here Oh This was about 60 pounds ago right So I gotta look down up under the door right But I said oh my god, it got to be about five or six of about this Oh my god So I figured like this I figured okay, you know what if it's going to happen it's going to happen You know if it's going to happen I'm gonna go down swinging right so I put my best black face on you know I tried to look mean you know, I look I look like this guy right here. I look like that guy right there right And I go who is it and they go chamber a commerce from oh my god the chamber commerce is the cookbook class And I'm panicking so I get to the door right and I pull the open the door open and when the door opens up These guys are falling all over the hole laughing at me They're rolling all into the cleaning ladies caught the cleaning lady didn't know what was going on right She's scared to death because she sees a black dude with no shirt like this so she grabs the lemon pledge like his pepper spray right she's ready Oh Everything now that realizes the practical joke everything calms down because I remember that I remember how hungry I was I'm like okay cool practical joke right so I'm going to bathroom to wash my hands while I'm in the bathroom Wash in my hands. I hear a commotion in the other room right I go back in the other room. They're going through the gift basket the maid is leaving with the watermelon My teen is drinking my 40 and it's fluffy bastard It's eating my chicken You need to laugh at baby Mahalo Hello Thank you so much I You The place You The The The The The The The The The The The The The The Thank you guys so much for being part of this I love you and I'm gonna make you guys proud This is gonna air next year on Comedy Central and everybody's gonna love it. Thank you Thank KC and talk about thank you so much. We're not love you, bro. I'll see you guys later Oh Oh, my god So I Get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, put a smile on your face, love bees in the play.
How many clubs are closed but I still want to do stand up. I think we just got to get people's roofs, get a mic and amp. That's all we need. Hammer crew, you, Dom, a few other people. We shoot it. We cut it up. That's the special. Good. You can tell this is a big election by the celebrities who are telling you to vote. It's people who are not used to hearing from. I'm seeing tweets like register now and I'm like, Charlie Sheen. This is bad. Did you see the one with the celebrities role naked telling you to vote? How are they going to up the ante in 2024? I'm Stanley Tucci and I'm jerking off on FaceTime to remind you of the importance of this year's election. There's two people fighting for free speech right now. It's comedians and racist. Isn't that weird? I didn't think we would be joining forces on a mission. It's just weird to see skinheads saying things like, we need to protect the first amendment. I'm like, I guess I stand with the area nation. It's racist like the first amendment because you could say racist shit and you get away with it though, you know. Racism is free speech so I like a tomato is a fruit. Technically but if you put it in a fruit salad, it is going to fuck up the rest of the fruit. That's an issue. I guess it depends who's saying it. I've had friends who might call me Jew face and I'm like, yeah, whatever. And then the people I don't know that will call me buddy and I'm like, I do not care for that. That was annoying. Everyone thinks they're free speech at stake. It's not. You can say a lot. I got a death threat recently. I just said I want to kill you and I ended up having to show it to a cop and the cop goes, he said he wants to kill you not that he's going to. I was like, yeah, but that's an annoying loophole. He got to give me that. God says, I'm going to do that to me. I kick his fucking ass. I was like, cool, so they're going to do nothing. They call me a pussy. That's fine. Serving protect officer. Serving protect. Feels like we're doomed. I mean, there's a god. Don't you feel like God is up in the sky right now. Flat screen TV. Every country is a different channel. I feel like America. We're like the Bravo of God's cable package. We're like, look, it's entertaining. But these people are fucking trash. God watches six, right hours of America. Like, oh, I hate myself. I've got to start reading again. Growing up now must be the worst. Kids just beat the shit out of you and they emotionally fuck with you on the internet. Cyber bullying feels right. Like, when I was a kid, it was AOL or instant messenger. Not so bad. You had to make sure your parents weren't on the phone to cyber bully, you know? You had to be like, mom, get off with grandma. I'm trying to ruin lives, okay? Shit. It was a bigger deal. Cyber bullying now. I hate when older people are like, I used to get the shit kicked out of me. Log off. I'm like, all right, first off, it's hard to log off. It's very addictive. And second off, you know, who wouldn't rather be assaulted than psychologically torment it? What would you rather get a wedgie or catfished? A black eye will heal. You know what won't is taking a greyhound to Syracuse and being like, I thought you'd be a woman. This sucks. This is the worth 13th birthday ever. That joke got sadder and sadder. You're the roommates? Oh, hell yeah, this dude came straight out of Woodstock. I like this guy. He's like, look, I had to stop at a festival. Yeah, I love that, man. What do you do for work, man? I'm a designer. I just not a fucking, of course. Only designer would have the balls to pull this off and be like, you know what? It's working. I'm a designer. I work for Cosmo. Oh, hell yeah. Cosmo. To give it women bad advice for decades. Cosmo. Ladies, this is what he really wants. Silence. I've never seen that article. I've never seen a Cosmo article. Give him peace for one day and everything will be great. Are all you guys in finance? No, what do you do? Real estate. All right. And your mom's in real estate, too? His mom? All right. What do you do? I work at Amazon. Fuck, part of the problem. But I do. Hey, wait. Unless we sell this to Amazon, in which case, very good people. And I'm going to handle this like Trump. Hey, they could be great people. We don't know. We don't know how they feel about me. You have to invite more people than you want here because people just bail. These aren't Hamilton tickets. This is a rooftop comedy show. They're just like, oh, yeah, I don't need to go to that. So I threw a hey, mass text. Anyone want to give me the roof tonight? Someone just said, I can't make it tonight. I've got COVID. The honor code, baby. Yeah. I don't go to Paul V with messing up Puerto Rico. Yeah. You say, Hunter? Sure, yeah. What's up? You go, Paul V. Yeah. Hey, Paul V. What's up? Hi. What? It's Sam. Oh, my God. It's Sam. Oh, my God. How are you? I found out about you during quarantine. And you got me through quarantine. Oh, thank you. I've been going to meet you. Oh, my God. This is so cool. You got you through quarantine. You're meeting me. I met Jack Daniels. I've been drinking on meds. I recommend it. You ever do this Google search? How much you could drink on the meds you're on? That's a... I just go with the article that matches how much I feel like... like drinking. I'm like, according to the medical journal of Guadalajara. I can have as much as I want. This is awesome. And it's outdoor drinking. Now, this started a spring break. It very quickly became end of the world vibes. But either way, cheers. You know? I was drinking on the street in this neighborhood. I was having a drink on the sidewalk. And this waitress comes up to me. You can't hear a word they're saying because this is Manhattan. So she didn't even ask. She just does this. Oh, my dam. Small businesses are getting crushed. This sucks. Now, you feel the divide when you go on the road. I love going to different parts of the country. It's one of my favorite things about America is going to Kentucky. You play that never would have gone, probably. I went to the racetrack in Kentucky, which is amazing. I was a worst-dressed person there. I was the only one who didn't look like a villain in Django on chain. But I walked to the racetrack. All the horses have ridiculous names. There's always one that's a little too crazy. There'll be like in third place, Moonlit Garden. In second place, Autumn Nights. And in first place, Touchy Uncle. I'm like, what was that? Was that last one? Touchy Uncle. They're like the champ. I like this out, man. They still do Civil Warry enactments, which is kind of weird. They're very hung up on that L. They don't want to talk about it. That's weird. They do that. I asked a guy, why do they still do Civil Warry enactments? He said, well, it gives them a connection. They're ancestors. That's not true. Because you would never recreate a fight that you lost. But you'd never be like, honey, remember that time I was wrong? And fight some friends over. Let's run it back. That would be awesome. You ever date someone and you're both in therapy? The fights take 10 hours. Every argument is like, I hear you. And I appreciate where you're coming from. However, he's like, oh, that was my whole day. I heard a guy in Times Square the other day said it was girlfriend shut up, bitch. And I was like, that is not okay. But he is crushing me in time management. You know what women hate when you're arguing they hate when you tell them to calm down? So now when she yells at me, I say, love your energy. Love what you're doing. A little more. I'm annoying. I repeat myself. I said I was like, man, I love this Thai restaurant. She was, you've told me that three times. And I said, you're the only person that I hang out with anymore. You want to spend all your time with me? There's going to be reruns. I can't bring it every night. That's what a relationship is. It's like a TV show where the writing gets progressively worse. Because season one, you're like, this is good. Season three comes along. You're like, we should kill off a character. We got to keep people engaged here. I was on the phone with my friend the other day. You ever just not listen to the new guests at the end? My friend said, I don't know what to do about her. And I was like, I think you should fuck her. And he was like, my mom. I was not present for all of that conversation. And I threw a Hail Mary. I'm not a good partner. I can't date. I'm not. I don't listen. Women always shocked. You're a bad listener. But I speak for a living. You should have seen that comment. I bet most people are bad at the opposite of their job. I bet most terrorists or shitty architects. I bet Ben Laden was a bad city planner. Most audiences laugh at jokes. You guys are like, we are shocked. We are shocked in a palt. And then we laugh. No, man. This is going to be good. So I had a brick. What? The mic cut out? How for how long? Four seconds. Four seconds. Fuck. Just like how I have sex, guys. Four seconds. And then I'm like, oh, there we go. All right. Well, this is a good start. It's good when the mic doesn't work. It's good fucking juju. I only said juju because I see all the amicus. That's why it's why I said juju. Are we good now? Yeah. This will work for our mics not working montage and the special. This is happened before. You have to hold the mic like this to make sure it's like working the clitoris. There's a lot of finesse. All right. There we go. How are we now? Good? That's a little rough. Bobby, I don't know if this is... This is used to guitars. It's not used to a raspy juu voice. So, how about now? Don't mind the drone. I know you guys, when you see eyebrows like this in American drone, you don't have long. But I will say it's going to be okay. Breakups are painful, right? Because your friend speaks to you in cliches. My friend was like, oh, dude, it's like a death. I was like, is it? Well, my grandma died. None of my friends were like, thank God. Your grandma was the worst. I don't think actually she's going to make it. We always like that. She's a lovely woman. You guys are snuggled up. That's fucking... You got how long you guys been together? Must be not that long. Right? Because that's... Yeah? Two years? Wow! Good for you! Don't give them too much credit. Some of us are going through personal things right now. Where do you guys meet? Church? Oh my God. What the fuck? I guess that's good PR for church. You never hear about the adult relationships that come out of there. What? Sorry. One of my best friends is a Catholic guy. I give him a ton of shit about the pedophilia in the priesthood. And he gets so angry the other day he said to me, he goes, teachers fuck kids too. And I was like, I like that angle. Right? That's good. But I understand what he's saying. It's not a problem exclusive to the church, but he is making it sound like everyone does it, dude. Why don't you just back off? And I've seen pictures of some of these teachers. It is a different degree of my West Asian. We're talking top shelf versus bottom shelf. No? I'm losing you? I'm jerked off the teacher porn. I've never typed in hot horny cardinals. Yes. Oh yeah. Thank God for Hawaiian shirt guy. I was in trouble. I did really care in that joke. Some of you guys were like, we're not so sure. He's like, I'm all in on this one. I too have jerked off the teacher porn. Teacher porn, man. That is, what you go to when you're watching it? Do you have one? Yeah. Girl on guy. Very good. I got good news for you. The internet is loaded with that. Girl on guy. He's like, holy shit. This is, I am in luck. That's the best finish to have. It's tough after a breakup because I travel a lot. When you travel, you think of the person. Anything goes wrong on a plane. I'm like, shit, if anything happens, I know she knows I love her. What do you think of as a single guy in that scenario? If this thing goes down, I hope my friend Phil knows I only like him in small doses because he could be a lot. She's never at a one night stand I have. And she was scared I was going to cheat on her. I was scared she was going to fall in love with someone, which I think is way worse. She would send me text like, did anyone hit on you after the show? And I'd send her text like, hey, do you feel safe with anyone from work? That would not be okay with me. These coast people drink, west coast people smoke. Every time I say I'm going to have a drink, they always say, you should smoke weed instead. Instead, like at the similar experience, I drink to quiet the voices in my head. I smoke weed. It's like I had a party in here and only the worst people showed up. Every voice is like, you're weird looking. You're going to die alone. That's why alcohol is one voice and it's very positive. You have a few drinks and someone shows up in your head like, cool jacket. You don't have abs but you're right there, dude. Love it. I smell some weed. I'm not going to lie. I'm looking right at you guys just by, just by profiling. Like it's definitely coming from the band and the artist. Do I want some? Of course, but I'm trying to put a show on for you guys. And it's going to turn into a very weird show. If every other joke I'm like, why didn't you guys like that one? What was wrong with it? I was so drunk like about eight months ago. I was leaving my friend's house. I hail a cab or six in the morning. I'm stumbling. I hail a cab again. The car's the driver goes, look, Guardia. He's in the airport. And I'm wasted. So I just said, yes. He just drive me the airport as the sun is coming up. I've got no luggage. And then I finally sobered up a little. I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. JFK. It's a better heart. I got a shake, Jack. Let's go there. Wednesday. Are you putting it out? I'm trying to see if I got a Wednesday show. I don't fucking know. It's a problem. We got two-thirds day. Hey, Sam Rao here. You've got a roof for this Wednesday night. We will come. Cool friends, a mic, an amp. Nice view with help and some white claw. We'll be there. If you build it, we will come. Hit me up. Let's do like a full mile radius. I don't know if it works that way. Oh, we got some people. Yeah, but there's like 150 people right now. That's a lot of people to blast. I can't do that. First one attacks me. Hey, a rare man had in text. Private show. Private show, roof, starting in 20. Yeah. Is that real? Hey, my biological father, he lives in artist's house. Which is weird because he's not even an artist. And anyway. He always escape artists. I met my biological father very late in life. I had a great mom and dad who raised my mom. He was my biological mom. But then I met my biological dad late. And the term is legally adopted when he adopts you. Even if you're not in a fucking orphanage, they say legally adopted. Which is such a dumb term. What's, you could just say adopted. What's illegally adopted? Couldn't have it, right? Anyway, first time I met him though, I go to his apartment. And he's just, he's petting a little cat on the left. And I was like, huh. He's like, yeah, I rescued her from the side of the road. And I nursed her back to health. I was like, huh. So you did have it in you. I run into him at the rec center. And the most New York thing to run into him at the Y. I run it because he goes over physical therapy. I go there to swim lamps, you know. Which, you know, I know it doesn't look like it, but I do put work in this physique, unfortunately. I see him at the rec center and I was awkward. I said, hey, and he goes, hey. And I just panicked and I said, I'll be right back. And I just left. And I feel like on some level, he had to be like, well, play it. All done. New Yorkers have more fun energy, even the crazy people. At least you're entertained, you know. I was on the train, the other night late. This guy walks down. There's only a few people on the train just goes, y'all motherfuckers scared now. Just keeps looking at me, keeps going, y'all motherfuckers scared. And like the third time he said it, we're like, yes, we are scared. This is the right response. You were chemically imbalanced. And there's only two of us. I figured out, you know when the worst time to see a homeless person is, is right after you ate a bunch of sushi, that's the worst, right? Because they're like, I'm starving. I'm like, I know me too. This sucks. And I just spent 60 bucks, which is the bigger ripoff, Math or sashimi. Who knows? L.A. people, you eavesdrop and some of the conversations, you're like, I heard a woman in the grocery store, she goes, my phone is like my baby. And I was like, that's not true. Right, because phones get better every year. Babies have made little to no progress. I can go more than two minutes without looking at a baby. You know? Yeah, you never leave a phone on the stranger's doorstep. That would be insane. Yeah, if you saw a phone on your doorstep, you'd be like, oh my god, why? Someone lost it. Yeah, if you saw a baby on your doorstep, you'd be like, this was on purpose, right? It's all I'm saying. Phones are better, right? L.A. even though the way they talk, New York, there's like a togetherness. Even when you hate the people, you feel like a connection. Right? In L.A. they're just on their car all the time. In New York, you're like, you're right. We do use that excuse, you're like, I can talk to anyone in New York. I'm not really though, you're just good. You're like, 2 a.m. I can go to the bodega and just be like, how much for this pint of Ben and Jerry's? He's like 899, I'm like, you fucking piece of shit. But we're connected, you know? New Yorkers do, we do have like a way of talking, right? Where it's like, the ADD is so, it could come off as rude to a non-native, right? You're just walking down the street like, dude, you need to break up with that girl. Great diner, right there. You should go to that diner. I always load the strata. Dude, you need to get that abortion. Chinese one's special, right? Speaking of take-outs. That crowd was great. Very cool, I flumped the line here too, but they were forgiving, they were cool. They were little, I could tell, tens. So I couldn't really feel like I'd go into the crowd really, you know? You're a little more tense, you're not like, you can't really do crowd work, but I think that's cool. I mean, like, I'm down as a due material too. So, we'll fill it out, maybe the West Village will be a little more. We can improvise a little more there, but, you know, I'm down and just get the jokes too. And then the rest is crazy, right? So, I'm in the bodega, and this guy is like a crackhead who's giving the owner a ton of crap. And I was like, hey, is everything cool in the bodega owners? Like, oh, yeah, he's one of the good ones. He's one of the good crackheads. Is that saying no New York is back when the bodega owners and the crackheads are back like this? There's some potaco. No, was it? Oh, I am, I'm professional. Oh, well, you should probably click, because I was really not funny. Why was it not funny? Well, you were saying what the f- How is it offensive? I'm really interested in how it's offensive. I was talking about the togetherness and resilience of New York. I'm not trying to start shit here. Oh, thank you. I'm going to tell them. They were just like, wait, that's the comedian that they were talking about. Oh, really? I just over had a million comedies. She thinks I'm funny. No, he's great. I know a big group of them. How about wonderful and I would be great. Oh, no, you're not interrupting at all. You're great. You're making me feel better after that interaction. Hey, isn't that fun? You can f- and turn it around just like that. That's New York. Someone hates you. At one stop, they like you 10 feet later. I've never taken my shoes off to do comedy before. This is the- I'm going to steal a pair of Jordans on the way out. I think you got to trade up. That's my motto. Everything's a touchy issue now, isn't it? Like, they're doing a trans superhero in a Marvel movie. That's a big story. Yeah, they're doing a trans. And you know they're just patting themselves on the back. Like, we did it, guys. We did it. You know they're going to mess it up. They're so politically correct in those movies. There's going to be a supervillain like, you mutants are all freaks. Except for you, your brave. But the rest of you, ah. My cousin is trans. Yeah, and my mom was concerned for her safety. I was like, look, it's going to be okay. Being trans is a lot like being a stand-up comic. Because at first you're on to non-core like, I guess you're doing this now. But then in like three years, you're like, all right, I'll start telling people. So. Just put your time in. Pay your dues. My friend was talking about that transports-illustrated model. You know what I'm talking about? She called me like, dude, she's so hot. I can't even tell the difference. And I was like, yeah, I know you mean well, but that is a weird compliment to give a human. Like, she's, I can't believe it's not butter or some shit. But she's like, shake out this impossible burger of a android here. It was amazing. I was watching mass shooting footage on CNN, and they did, um. They show the footage, and then they, and then someone cursed and they bleeped. Is that not, is that not our country in a nutshell right now? What you're about to hear might make you very obsessed. I knew this year was fucked when, uh, when the Pope, the Pope said you got to give up trolling on the internet for Lentel. I was like, I think we're doomed. Right? Because it used to be chocolate or cigarettes. Now he's like, try to not call a stranger on Twitter or Gisrag for a few days. Can you handle that? It's hard. Are we gonna have PTSD from this? I don't know. A little, right? I feel like my PTSD is gonna be like, like, you got to zoom in and I'm gonna be like, I'm not going back to you. I'm done with it. You ever just look at your phone when you get a scam call and it says scam likely on it? I'm like, man, that's pretty impressive. It's predicting the motives of the call. I wish you would do that with every phone call. Your ex-girlfriend calls still angry. Let's put this off to a later date. I love those IRS scam calls. I got one recently. I said, hello, the guy goes, you're in a lot of trouble. I said, what happened? He goes, oh. That's how I should have known it wasn't the real IRS. I don't think the real government is like, oh shit, dude. You fucked up bad. So I said, what happened? If you don't send a seven grand immediately, I'm sending over the sheriff. The sheriff. Yeah, the sheriff. I'm like, I'm on the upper west side. Let me see if there's parking for his horse real quick. I don't know. Yeah, man. Now, you know what the scam is? I want you to go to Walgreens and buy gift cards and read the back of the code because you wired the money. They can get busted. But you read the code. They think they're all right. You should know it's not the government at that point. I don't think the real IRS is that chill. They're like, look, if you don't have seven grand in cash, we do accept asking Robbins. So we're pretty chill at the government. We like ice cream. I hooked up with a girl on the road years ago. I'm in Michigan. I'm in the hotel room after the show with her. She's chugging a giant water bottle before sleeping together. I said, hey, is everything okay? And she said, oh, I got a hydrate before. And I said, yeah, cool. I might have misrepresented myself here. This is a pretty low impact. I said, yeah, this is a pretty low impact activity. Think a leptical, not treadmill. That's an idea. And she didn't know I have to hydrate because I'm a squirtor. And I was like, oh, my God. Yeah. You never see that Gatorade commercial, right? You should. Gatorade. Is it in you? I don't know. We'll see. And she got nervous. She said, does that change anything? I said, yeah, the tip I leave house keeping. I got to bring it out. So I'm telling my friend about it. He said, how was it? I said, you know, while we were having sex, she actually slipped the finger in my butt. Oh. Yeah, and my friend said, that's the prize you. And I said, what did she complied with my request? That's the mail G spot, folks. In the butt. Some guys say, no, I've been. I've come back with good news. It's right there. Just a hand. Like, Tolstito's hand to my friend. I'm going to say, no, I'm going to say, no. I've been. I've come back with good news. Like Tolstito's hand to my friend. That much. Because some guys are like, no, that's gay. It's not gay. The buttholes for everybody. The buttholes like a Broadway show. Right? Gay is talking about it the most. But if you're a straight guy, you never go. You're missing out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I call mine wicked. That's what it is. Unless she goes in too deep, then I call it lame-ass. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right now we're hoping that people show up. Oh, I love you, man. Oh, hey, sorry, didn't interrupt. Looks like you're having a nice time. I don't think that's a big comedy. You seem like a fun person. Are you like a yogi or something? You're a yoga teacher at Holy shit. I can feel energy. She's so calm and centered and her posture is so nice. Matt, be very careful, please. You're like on the side of the thing. You good? Yeah. I'm serious, though. You're like, right on that. Okay. All right. Safety first, guys. If he dies, admit torn jokes. You know how fucking guilty I'm going to feel? I'm at his funeral. Matt died the way he wanted to. In the middle of a joke about me jacking off. His mom is like, this is the worst. This is the worst eulogy I've ever heard. Matt and I were just talking about people who like, you ever talked to someone that they've got nothing to say? They're just like, you ever see this movie and you're like, yeah, I know like, good movie. I'm like, that's it. That's all you got. I was working with a comic once and he goes to the crowd. He goes, he goes, any birthdays? And some of the crowd goes, yeah, it's my birthday and he goes, happy birthday. We're at a comedy club. That's all you got. How do you guys meet? At a yoga? She was a teacher? Yes. And you fucking went for it? That's the dream. It's a weird dream, but look. What did you say to her? You have a beautiful smile. You're lucky you're handsome. That line does not work for everybody. You a beautiful smile. Holy shit. Get away from me. That line is reserved for people with your bone structure. You know what is fun is some of these celebrities getting canceled for shit that we most of us. I'm not going to say everyone here, but at least the man I've seen porn of. Someone will say this director auditioned women for his movies and then tried to sleep with them. I don't know, that is despicable. I have masturbated to that ex-ex scenario. It was scripted. So, feel like that lets me off the hook a little. How long have you guys been together? Year and a half. You're in a half that was at a dating half? No. Work? Where do you work? We worked at an investment bank. You were an investor. I thought you were going to be like, I'm a director. She auditioned for one of my bests. And I was like, lady, you have got the goods. That's great. So, you were an investment bank. And you guys just met and after work, a party or something? Christmas party. That's where it happens man. That's where it is. Now let me explain to you why entertainers get canceled all the time. Imagine a Christmas party every night. Yeah. It is funny watching comedians get canceled for jokes that uh, worked. Do you know what I mean? The whole footage of a comedian and the jokes killing. I know like this is despicable. I'm like, how about all the people who are laughing? That's why I record all my shows now. Because if I'm going down, I'm taking all you motherfuckers with me. That's so funny when the tables have turned out. I watched too much porn. I was watching porn the other day. You had the day. I have a good job. And a Tuesday. And this woman comes on before the porn star since you guys, wouldn't you rather be with the real woman instead of at home alone jerking off? And I was like, yeah, but I got a meeting in five. I don't think I can swing it. Real women, you got to get them in the mood. It's like pre-heatin' an oven. Jack and off, it's like a microwave. It's not the same quality, but there's always time. You know? Hey, buddy, how are you? Are you passionate? What do you think? I love this. What a time. It's always going to get a neighbor heckling you and it's hot, but... Yeah, buddy, how you doing up there? Thank you, sir. Wow, he walked away. I walked the guy in his own home. I eat when I'm single the same way I jerk off in a relationship, quickly and quietly over the sink. And I get sad. I have a question for you guys. You ever think you're a sex addict and then you comment, you're like, definitely not. Turns out I'm addicted to calming everyone's in a while. It's actually pretty common. Years ago, there was this baseball player, Dumb and Young. He got really drunk and time square. He spit on a guy, pushed him, called him a fucking Jew, and the guy sued him for $10 million, and it turned out he was not a Jew. So... That guy is the real anti-Semite. He's like, what did you call me? A Jew? I will see you in a court of law. After a very uncomfortable phone call with my lawyer. Because you know. Jew. Because I'm a comedian. People like to tell me they're conspiracy theories. And as a comedian, I like them. As a Jew, it's not my favorite. Rarely, am I like, oh, you think the Holocaust was a hoax? Go on. I like what this is headed. Now, I like to really off the wall conspiracy theories. I don't like the generic ones. I like the ones that are like, Jared from Subway. I don't think he did it, man. He was framed by the big wigs at Quiznos. Now, I was reading this article on Jeffrey Epstein the other day. I don't want to divide the roof here. I think he was a pretty bad person. I don't know the consensus. A few of you look like you might have dabbled on this island. But... I'm scrolling through my phone and it just says... Have you ever read on your phone? It doesn't matter the article, there's ads. It's weird to be reading about a human trafficker and then every once in a while you're like, oh yeah, Nike, that's cool. There's at least that they work the ad into the article, right? Like, you think what Epstein did was low? Check out the prices on the new LeBronz. This is crazy. I think you date women that are like your mom, right? That's just using New York crowd. You've probably been a therapy. I think you date women who are like, I do at least, you know? Because my mom was like a very overprotective mom. I'd get sick. She would react like I had stage 4 cancer every time. And I'm looking for a woman that can match that intensity. It's almost like I'm auditioning her for the part of my mom. I'm like, I'm feeling sick and she's like, it's just a head cold. And I'm like, thanks for coming in. We're going to take this in another direction. So my mom would do this thing where she just reads me bad reviews, I guess. My mom would just call me and say, I read that awful review you got. I'm like, what are you talking about? And then I assume it's the New York Times or something. And then I look it up and I'm like, mom, trip advisor. We didn't have to look into this one. We don't have to look at what every bad review says about me. So I looked it up, obviously. It's from Naples, Florida, which is the worst week of comedy I ever did. And they give you one star reviews. Like, I had a good time in their city. One star. You guys were fucking one star. I didn't like you. And the night to stay in Naples, it was bad for everybody. It's the point. Let me read you the review. On Friday night December 14, Sam Herrel was inappropriate. I like that she gave the date like it's Pearl Harbor. We had a family event planned for good laughs. Our son, daughter-in-law, adult autistic grandson in his friend. Adult autistic grandson? I hope that's not how she refers to him in public. We'll be three for dinner tonight. Me, my husband, and our adult autistic grandson. He's like, Graham, my name is Stephen. Can you stop? Can you stop calling me that? The first two local comedians were great and the food was excellent. Then came Sam Herrel, the headliner. He was a terribly bad choice. He spoke of Olga's opinions that were not funny, degraded his and our US president. We can't even have the same US president. That's how much she hates me. I'm like, lady, it's Florida. We're all on the same sink and ship here. He degraded Naples. I did. I did. And I'll do it again too, fuck Naples. I'm not some snob. I'm just going to re-known a lot of three times. I'll go back. I'll come back as long as you're not hardly abusive as an audience. And he used autistic kids for a joke. I did not. I don't even know how I would. I just scanned the crowd. What does that, some adult autistic grandson in the house? When you get his ass up here so I can roast him. Autism style. People began to protest. No one protested. I've been doing this a long time. I've never had to set so bad that I've been like shit, they're breaking up, they're taking size. He also said he would punish the crowd by going on longer. That's... That is... All right, look. Sometimes you hate the crowd so much. You're like, I'm burning this motherfucker, big rat. I could go back and stalk my hotel room or I could ruin their lives. He could not address those without insulting the age group of retirees, telling them that they'd be dead soon. Let me elaborate. I didn't say, hi, hi, you're going to be dead soon. I said I feel bad that this shitty comedy show is one of the last things you'll ever see. So... She omitted the compassion with what I spoke. Comedy doesn't let you feel good for more than a night. I'll give you an example. I did a gig in... So this happened in 2014. I did Conan. The first time I ever did a late night, I said, did Conan. You're happy to get there. It's a big deal for you at the time, right? You're like fucking... Took me like eight years or something to get there. The next night, you go to a gig in Virginia Beach, which whatever. You show up, I'm happy to be working. I say, hey, I'm Sam, to the bartender. She goes, someone needs to replace the urinal cakes in the bathroom. I said, cool, I'm the headliner for the weekend. She goes, so no. Yeah, that's a firm no. You said, well, I can't do it. I'm a woman. I said, well, I don't know what to tell you. I feel like it's a bad look for your venue. If the guy who's faces on the poster is working behind people at the urinal, can you speed it up? I'm on in five. Okay. Obviously I bomb every show. That goes with that saying. I get off... And it's not a Naples Florida comatose bomb. It's a Virginia Beach. We drink lollile and iced teas. We're not good people, bomb. You know? So I get off stage. I turn to my left. I see a giant poster of a magician. So it gets my attention. His name is Stu. He's a handsome young magician, spiky hair, holding two dubs very seriously. And it's like, what a weird poster. I turn to my right. It's Stu in person. It felt like magic. He's at the bar and he goes rough. I was like, yeah, you could say that again. He goes, you should get hammered with me tonight. You know what? I can't think any lower. Why the fuck not? So he said what became one of my favorite sentences ever. He goes, let me tell you something about this town. I fucking run Virginia Beach. I think about that quote constantly. I was like, all right. And he goes, I'm going to show you the Virginia Beach no one talks about. And I was like, that could be any part of Virginia Beach. So I've never heard a thing about your city. I don't think most people have. And by the way, then he just takes me to the bar next door, which is a bit disappointing. I thought we were going to see some CD underbelly. I was like, I could have found this. And there's a long line. I said, let's just drink somewhere quiet. And he goes, oh, we're not waiting on line. I fucking run this town. It's like, right, I forgot. So we sort of cut in the line. People are getting pissed. Stu just give him the finger. I was like, this guy might be a lot. We get to the front of the line. The bouncers see them and immediately goes, not tonight, Stu. People know this guy. And Stu goes, you better let us in or else. And the guy just let us in. That's all it took. That was magic trick number two. We're in the bar. Stu's buying everyone drinks. We're doing shots. We're getting wasted. He starts doing magic at the bar. He's a damn good magician. It's incredible. Women are gathered around. They're owing an eye after every trick. After one of the tricks, you just grabbed one of the women and started making out with her. And I was like, holy shit, this guy might run Virginia Beach. This is impressive. Then he just lets her go and he goes, fuck this shit. Strip club. I was like, that's not really my scene. He goes, trust me. And I was like, damage Stu. We made it this far. What the hell? So we start walking to his car. To me, Stu, his friend is a designated driver. We get to his car. It's a very nice BMW that's been horribly vandalized. Stu falls to his knees and goes, no! Who would do this to me? Am I for a thought I was anyone? I've known you 47 minutes. I could give you a list of suspects right now. He's hopping and popping. He's like, why? And then he finally cheers up. And he just looks at me and he goes, we're still going. That's a car, right? We get in the car. He's cheerful on the way there. He even turns to me in the back seat and goes, you've never seen anything like a Virginia Beach strip club. And then we walked in. I was like, it looks a lot like Tampa. I missed my brother. We're greeted by this gorgeous stripper. She kisses him on the mouth. And I was like, who is this guy? And he said, this is my girlfriend. I was like, oh, Stu, you loveable sleaze. I've known you for like an hour and a half. I watch you cheat and I've met your girlfriend. I hope that when she busts him cheating, he at least handles her like a magician. She finds some cocktail napkin. Who is Denise? You look, let me see that. Magic. She's like, damn it, Stu. That was kind of cool. We get wrecked. To me, Stu, the stripper, the designated driver, all of us were bombs. I had to cab it home. Horrible morning, hung over his hell. A week later, I told this story on a podcast, not thinking about it, all right? A week after that, my phone vibrates. It just says, Stu. And I panic. I don't remember saving this nothing. I panic again because I don't remember saving the picture that pops up, Stu holding two dubs. I'm like, what is that? So I press ignore, he texts me, pick up motherfucker. Hey, Stu, you made me sound like a piece of shit on that podcast and I said, no, I didn't. I made you sound cool and he goes, true. That's all it took. That's how forgiving he was. I actually felt bad. Anyway, years later, I find myself on TripAdvisor, because of my mom. And I'm looking up bad reviews I got. There's a few of them. So I start looking up some of my comedian friends. I get some bad reviews too. I don't know why, but I thought to look up still. And he's got some bad reviews, believe it or not. One just said, one star, Stu bombed our corporate event. Who will not have back and I was like, hell, no, Stu deserves better. So I left my own review. I just wrote five stars. This motherfucker runs Virginia Beach. Thank you so much, guy. Thank you for coming out. Thank you so much. Did we get it? Right it. Whoa! Oh shit! Hell yeah! This fucking rule! We're cutting in between, we'll see. I'm thinking of a special and everyone thinks that it's lit. Oh, down to earth guy! Red and up to sea mud! I don't like it. It's just me, I'm the guy. I don't like him summarizing our art like this. We're frauds!
رف yer B ve foarte Oh! Good evening! What is going on, everybody? Thank you for coming out. All right, we're all settled there. I'm excited to be here. Been here all day in this town. I am? I did the whole town. Which means I went to the pizza place. Got a love-bucks county, man. I'm going to quaint little coffee shops. I was at a coffee shop today. One person bathroom. That's what we got going now. Everyone was complaining about, you know, men's and women's identifying. Now we just have one person bathrooms and we all just got to wait. When so much in the bathroom and you're waiting, how long are you expected to wait before you cannot? And say, are you dead in there? Without being the asshole for doing that, right? Look, I gave a little knock on it. You're right there. The guy goes, whoever's in there, why don't you give him a minute? I'm like, okay, I gave him 27 minutes, man. I'm going to watch the sitcom. What are they doing? Transcribing a caranet, man. What the fuck? This is my move now. Whenever I get up to a bathroom, even though I know it's already occupied, I do a hard jiggle on the handle. Okay? And then you inevitably always go, somebody's here. And then I go, oh, I'm sorry. But in my head, I'm thinking, and now you know, somebody's out here. Let's put this into over-driver, right? And then if they still take too long, my next move is I jiggle it again. But I pretend I'm somebody else. Right? And in my original character, I say to the second jiggle, I go, yeah, no, I'm actually next. There's a line. Right? Ah! Another ring, oh shit, now there's two people up there! Telling about the time I'm done, they think there's a town hall meeting going on on the other side. They come out, it's just me, they're looking both ways, man. Everybody else died a septic shock. I'm the only one left. Right. So. It's nice to be out, right? Getting some laughs. A lot of dissension in this country right now. Don't worry, I don't get political, we don't have to worry about that. But whatever is going on in this country, it's all a deal. You know, I just don't like when foreign is starting to jet thing. Right? I was doing a gig in Toronto, I got a couple of buddies at a Canadian, we're doing a few shows together, I had a couple of drinks afterwards. One of my buddies goes, yeah, you're president Trump, but I wouldn't want to have him run in all country. I couldn't even bite my tongue. I'm like, bro, I don't even know who your guy is. I want to put this perspective, alright? In your country, and I don't even know who the guy is! It's all... By the way, my guy isn't your country, too. Don't kid yourself. Don't kid yourself. Can't it up. Are you kidding me? I love the Canadians, but let's be honest. 80% of the entire Canadian population lives within 50 miles of the American border. And this day when I'm saying, they hovered over to Velver ropes. They're dying to get it! Now with a deficit, I don't know if you read about this, 22 trillion, right? The deficit. Apparently they're talking about this. Apparently they're talking about selling Montana. To Canada. To pay off the deficit a little bit. I'm like, why don't we just take Canada? Why sell anything? Let's just take this! It's because that deficit's up to 22 trillion, man. We owe China. Again, I don't care political, but people get my face with it. They're like, China owns us. Get ready! China owns us. I'm here to tell you, don't even worry about it. It doesn't matter because we're not fucking paying them back. I mean, that's one of those that's a joke, but it's not a joke, joke, don't say. You don't chip away at 22 trillion. Right away! Oh, we knocked it down the night pin! Tril! No, you just wake up one day and say, you know what, screw this? I'm not paying anybody. Yeah, you don't, you gotta do what I got into it, right? I just want to do a buzz run for president. I go, I get rid of the deficit by first day in office. I'm gonna be like, how would he do that? I wouldn't tell him, I'll go, you gotta vote for me, baby. I'm gonna tell you, you gotta spin the wheel! Can you do it? Can you can? Maybe enough people getting their voting booth and they see a name and they're like, let's give it a shot! My first day in office, I'll just show that building in New York Cityway. You see, the deficit on the wall of the building, it just constantly keeps shooting up. I just have a camera on it. Is everybody looking? And I just press a button. Boom! Zero! There you go. Go tell your friends. Spread the word. The channel will be watching on TV going, aw, shit, that's a problem. That's gonna be a problem. I'm not gonna do that. So I love this small town vibe. I live in a small town upstate New York, called Fredonia, New York. So, yeah, it's a lot like this. But, how taxes are like one month worth of your taxes? I can't believe it, but I moved to this town. It's like an hour outside of Buffalo, a long story. My wife is from the area. My first move day, I was at Main Street with a buddy. We're going in to have a couple beers. I didn't feed the meat. And he goes, I can be a problem. He goes, what? If you don't mind getting Jack $7. $7? That's the five. And I feed the meat. I'm like, I'm gonna keep it here monthly, bro. I lived in New York City, but 22 years. That's a cup of coffee. Yeah, everyone's employed by the factory. If the factory shuts down, we'll have to move. My story's a little different. If Delta shuts down, I got a move. That's how life fly out of Buffalo. Delta, that's my preferred airline. Delta serves peanuts, pretzels, and cookies. If you fly Delta, you would know that. But you would, because they say it to every single passenger. It's a little bizarre, man. But there'll be three in a row. You know, peanuts, pretzels, cookies? Peanut pretzels, cookies? Peanut pretzels, cookies. Peanut pretzels, cookies. I'm like, it had to pass me twice. Forget to them. I've probably heard it two rows up. I'm going to anything I'm sitting there going, you better ask me. Don't assume I heard that shit. Don't assume I heard that shit. It's better being Delta rule, man. I feel better than a flight attendant. I'm just being late and bed in their own home. The husband's like, good morning, baby. He's just like, pay nuts, pretzels, cookies, pretzels, cookies, pretzels. He's like, baby, yo, yo, baby, yo. You're drinking, man. You got a drink on. You wouldn't even know. Am I Broadway play? Get a got the drink, guy. He's trying to stare at me like you're waiting for me to break into Othello or something. Even I'm drinking and I'm performing, guy. Do you think I'm eating hot? I'm drinking hot. I'm drinking hot. I'm drinking hot. I'm drinking hot. I'm drinking hot. I'm drinking hot. I'm drinking hot. I'm drinking hot. I'm drinking hot. I'm drinking hot. You know, his airline snacks. We can't get enough of him, right? I fly early. That's my thing. I always fly early. There's a problem. You got time to fix it. I fly so early. I got to the gate once. Coffee shops. Not even open yet. It's just me and a guy about my age and he's in a wheelchair and we're both waiting to get coffee. Now, he gets a phone call. Coffee shop opens. A figure let me treat the guy, right? I come back and give him the coffee. He thanks me, introduces himself and we shake hands. Now, no sooner do we finish shaking hands. The guy gets out of the wheelchair. I consider that I just physically shook his hand. As you could imagine, my first thought was, I think I just healed this guy. I don't even know what protocol is. Do we call the pope? What do we do? Right? Do I know what protocol is? Do we call the pope? What do we do? Right? Do I not wash the head? Many sees the stun look in my eye and he goes, oh no, I work for the airport pushing people and the planes getting in. And I just got in early, you know. You don't sit in the wheelchair, guy. You think I'm going to go, no, you know you're in it. I assume you could walk by the way you were wiggling in it. Of course, now my next thought was, it was me 250 foot of corn. With those airline snacks, right? I fly, I get like 5 a.m. flight and you just hear like all these little Styrofoam bags everyone trying to open up the pretzels. 5 a.m., right? And if you were in your own kitchen at 5 a.m., and you opened up a cabinet, it's sort of pretzels, you wouldn't eat them. What are we doing? From came, I've had to flight once, 5 30 in the morning, flight attendant comes on, tells us they're out of pretzels, they're not going to be serving pretzels. And again, sitting right next to me, mumbles to himself out loud, he goes, God damn it. Like what is this guy flying belted just for the pretzels? Like they're not anti-Ani's guy. They never see people put the airline snacks in their bed for later. Oh my God, how much trash is that? How does it even play out, man? Like, you run your couch at home and your wife's like, I'd love a snack. You're like, get the belted pretzels, baby. I don't know, I don't know. I had to flight once, 5 30 in the morning, flight attendant comes on, tells us, is a child on board allergic to peanuts, and then they're not going to be serving peanuts. Now, I have a child too, I understand, I'm not getting into all that. I'm just saying, many of you hear it, that someone a child is allergic to peanuts. It's just you've been nature. It's like murder on the oriental express. You're just looking around, trying to see if you can figure out which kid it is and can't eat the peanuts. It's probably a red head, it's got to be a red head. And the pilot comes on 10 minutes later, he thanks us again for not eating the peanuts. I mean, it's 5 30 in the morning, who's eating peanuts? If the pilot came on and said there was a child on board allergic to coffee, he'd have been dead by 545. That got to say, with the allergic to peanuts, man, I mean, how allergic is allergic? You got to ask yourself, right? Like, if I opened up a little bag of peanuts all the way in the front of a plane, like if that kid was all the way in the back, right? If I'm just like, I just give a little 10, just a little 10, oh, shhh. Like, what was that? You could hear it in the back of a plane just a little. I'd be like, holy shit. The pilot gets orange. Somebody had to be like, that's something to be eating peanuts. Is that what I'm hearing? Somebody eating peanuts? I doubt you, right? I feel like I could eat the whole bag of peanuts and go up to the mother at the baggage gate. Just be like, just wanting to know, lady, your kid's full shit. I don't want to shout an egg to the ring, and I know this is an egg to the ring, but when you are not allergic to the thing, it's hard to wrap your head around it. Like, if I get stung by a bee, nothing happens to me. If I'm with somebody and they get stung by a bee and the head swells up, I feel like they're being lazy. I feel like I could be like, de-swell that, de-swell that. It's embarrassing. What are you doing? A sparigus, a perfect example, right? A lot of people eat a sparigus later on your pee that night, and it smells like a sparigus. That never happened to me. I thought it was witchcraft. In my late 30s, I must have had a chemical change in my body. I had a little a sparigus one night. Later that night, I'm out of bar. I'm in the bathroom peeing next to a friend. My friend's like, is that a sparigus? I'm smelling like a... I was so excited. Like, yes, dude! Wow! Not even a hit, man. It smelled like I was boiling a sparigus for 20 minutes. Holy shit. No other food to eat. And then pissed at it. It smells like... I never gonna be the bad thing when your body goes, what is that? The shrimp's scam? I'm smelling like that. What's that? Oh, it didn't eat the peanuts. Flying stressful. I was complaining to my brother. He goes, you gotta go southwest, man. That's my airline. Southwest. You pick your old seat for those of you who might not know. When you're walking down the aisle of a Southwest airline, you can sit wherever you want. So I gave it a shot. It's too much pressure. I would rather just be assigned to see. Because all you want to do is sit next to a normal person. Fetch your goal at the end of the day. When you fly Southwest, you literally stout them before you get on. You're seeing people get on before you. You make a note. It's like, oh, don't go next to that guy. I can tell by the vest he takes his shoes off. Mental note. Mental note. Avoid that one. We got a dog coming on. Forget that. That's a thing. Because you got to decide. You got to split second. When you get on the Southwest flight, you're walking down. There's a line of people in front of you. And you got to walk and you got to make a quick judgment. And once you pass someone, there's no going back. There are people riding your ass. You got to go like that one? That one? That one? That one? And you do a peek down. You're like, oh, it's loose. It's the rest of the way. When the guy behind you's like, you just stop. It must be a nightmare down there. Find what you can. Find what you can. The two quick and ghost down. My brother said, no, you've got to pay a few extra bucks. You get on the plane first. And you can sit wherever you want. It's like, did that route one time too? Which works. You get on every seat available. Very nice. Problem is, the Southwest flights all sell out. So eventually, somebody's going to be sitting next to you. So now, this is a whole different kind of pressure. Because now, as people are coming down the aisle, depending on what they look like, I'm making myself more or less appealing to sit next to them. I'm like, I got a guy in a humping jacket, leaning over. I won't even look at him. I'm rubbing my balls, picking my nose. I'm like, what are you talking about? I'm just not happening. Even if you sit here, I'm getting up. It's like a bear and I'm playing dead. I'm like, I'm playing dead. I'm playing dead. Then you get a nice normal lady coming down the aisle. I'm practically laying candles. I got incense going. I'm like, I do nails halfway through the flight. That's a thing to you. Have you seen somebody thinking about sitting next to you? And then you decide not to? What the hell are you? I'm like, mumble into the lady as she's going down the aisle. I don't know what you think is down there, lady. I've been down there. There ain't nothing down there. It is stressful flying. Every aspect of flying is stressful. My wife, she gave me this face cream for my birthday. It cost $50 a bottle. Right away, it comes with instructions from her. She's like, make it last. It's $50. You just need four dimes every night. Then I go through my airport security. I'll hit me go. They don't want to let me through with the face cream. Go to your love to when the TSA people start giving you suggestions that aren't even realistic. The lady looks at me and she goes, do you have a friend that you could call? That would come pick up the face cream. You got a friend that would do that for you lady? My friends actually do it never each other. Maybe I need new friends. And she doesn't even have a friend that would pick me up. I don't even know how I would make that phone call when I left in my ass so I'll have to go through. Seriously. You're going to call me friend, hey friend. You want to drive in an hour and ten minutes? The JFK airport, you pick up my face cream. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll tell you when I land a week later you drop that shit back off. Oh, you're a peach bro. You're a peach. That's why I drive. Whatever possible. I got a 2006 Subaru Outback. Yeah, alright man. Been through a lot together. Been through a lot together with the roof. I had a recall on the roof recently. Apparently the passenger side airbag could blow up. I had to take her in for a recall. My ruin, we've been through a lot. Anyone with a vehicle, you go, you go through a lot. Your vehicle becomes like family. You ever rubbed a dashboard? Going up the hill and really cold weather. I had my Subaru in minus three degrees. I'm like, you got this girl. You got this. I feel like a maddy. It's like rubbing a horse's neck. I go in for a rope recall. I've never done that before. I walk in and go, no problem, sir. We'll take you, Carl. Think about an hour and a half. You're just a tight-have-some coffee and we'll let you know when it's done. No sooner do I sit down. A tract of lady works for Subaru comes walking up with a clipboard. She goes, I just want you to know we did a quick evaluation of your vehicle. This is what it's currently worth, you know, which is nothing. And devastating to hear. I didn't ask for this information. She goes, if you want, we can take this and put it towards a new vehicle. You could be driving out with one of these beauties in less than a half hour. Now, this is all happening so fast and so insensitive. It's my vehicle. Looking out into a window with the dash and coming apart. I'm telling you, man, I'm only bringing it up because it's happening with cars. Before you know it's going to be happening, what else is human? Man, give me an egg getting a quadruple bypass. Nurse is going to come out, go up to your wife. Listen, before we cut this wall, it's open. Just want to let you know we got three men in our early 30s on the other side of the wall here. I am to take you out for a stay-ton. I go valveline. That's my oil people. I go to valveline. Valveline, they bring the dipstick into the waiting room to show you that they filled up your oil. Oh, how nice is that? I'm literally on the phone with my wife. I'm like, yeah, what do you say? Hold on, baby, he's showing me the dipstick. This was the Corialli. I just want to show you. We filled it all the way up right there. I'm like, beautiful, man. Thank you very much. I know nothing about cars. I think I can walk in and show me a completely dry, going, I totally drained all the oil out of the car. I'm going to dry. I go, beautiful. Get that oil out of there. I hate that shit. I was making an appointment with Valveline recently. They had me on hold, and I had it on speaker, and take it to the limit by the Eagles was playing. And my wife comes walking down the stairs, so I was babbling right away, and I go, hold on, they're about to pick up. They're about to pick up. And she goes, oh my God, why do you think that? Because the song is ending. Which is really what I thought. Well, you won't do that. You have to hold that when you're a song, and she do. You think they're going to pick up. Which is bizarre. That means I think there's a guy in Valveline hovering over the phone. Listen up to the Eagles song going, take it to the limit one more time. Valveline. I got a lot of like you people have around here too. Got a lot of the deacrossing sentence. Joey's perplexed me, you know. He's never driving along. You have woods for 10 miles on either side of you. Well, the same you get to the 11th mile as a sign saying, deacrossing next four miles. What about the last 10? How are you so confident that you didn't even need a sign? But did a guy go to put up a sign and the other guy go, forget the sign Tommy, we don't need a sign, we don't need a sign. Now we gotta sit down with the deac. He is in years ago, we worked on a laugh. That's the only legitimate way, right? Like 100 ideas ago, did like one highway representative sit down with one deer representing all the deas. That's how long ago this was. They were still called deas back then. And the highway guy said that if you can get all the other dea to cross between exit 42 and exit 43, I think I can get all my people to slow down when we go through that area. And the deer going, no, no, no, no. You want us to walk up a mile to cross over to come back down a mile and get to the pond to drink, no, no, no. I gotta go back to the other deas with more. You gotta get me more. I gotta go back one more. All right, all right, all right, all right. The highway guy said, how about this? For now, one more, then just one of you. It's still just dea. Okay? We drop the s. Only fish have that right now. And the deer went, that's hot, that's hot. I think I can go back to the other deas with that. I mean, you know what I mean? You mean the other dea? I already liked it! That's why we do 55. Have you ever tried to do a sustained 55? Like literally just do 55. I'm like, oh, are we even moving? Oh, we even fucking moving right now. Jesus Christ! I want to put in parking, walk, and protest. And before it is rolling over, it is grave right now. Step on it. I got a lot of 65 where I live in New York right at the thruway. I passed the cop recently. Let me explain the situation. The cop was doing 65 in a 65. Yeah, that's that. Then we all line up behind them. All right, here we go. What am I parade float? What are we doing right now? I even give them that smile through the windshield. Yeah, I always do 65. What am I ahead? I'm like, guys, as soon as you get off, I got to do 85. To make up for a 75, I would normally be doing right now. But even my GPS was going off. It was like, is there a cop in front of us? What the fuck am I doing? We're coppers and get knocked off. We can't pass it every exit. I'm looking at my wife. Like, what is he on a road trip with the cop? Was that of his jurisdiction? Was he stealing it? I'm like, I got to pass. I got to do the pass. That's what I do. Whenever I'm going to break the law in my vehicle, I announce it to everybody else in the vehicle. Like, if I'm going to make an illegal U-turn, I'm like, I'm banging a U-E. Everybody get ready. I'm banging a U-E. They're ready. I don't even know what that means for everybody else. Fuck. I'm not sure. I'm just letting you know about the dual violation. Whatever you got to do to be comfortable, that gets comfortable. I mean, I say it so clearly that if a cop pulled me over and I tried to talk my way out of it, I was like, oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I couldn't make that turn. I said, God, we're looking at you. God, I read your lips through the windshield. I'm saying you're going to bang a U-E. That's what I did though. I slowly passed the cop. I'm doing 70. He's doing 65. You ever do that slow five mile an hour pass? Oh, God, your heart is pounding the entire time. It's like walking past a pit bull in your flip flops. Oh, okay. I'm just giving the cop the look through the window the whole time. Like, are you cool with this? Give me a nod. Give me a smile. Let me know you're cool with this. Right? I mean, you can't let me slowly pass you. And then you light me up. That's a weak move, right? God, at least give me that two-fingal wave. Take it back, G. Take it back, hero. I think I apologize. I didn't realize the parade wasn't over yet. That's what I did though. I just slowly passed him. And then you got to get back in front of him. You're like, oh, God, I'm getting back in front of him. The balls! And you just slowly drive off. You know all the other cars of whisper in the sky, I just got it out of my mind. It's supposed to be limits of gotten the most intense. Anyone my age and older, and there's quite a few of you out there. Now, I'm saying all of us adults and beyond, come on. Right? Remember we were all growing up? People were passing our schools at like 45 miles an hour. If they did 50 and a teacher hopped into the outside, smoking a cigarette. The teacher might go, oh, there's kids! Oh, come on, you passed the school now. We got the speed bumps, the flashing lights, the SWAT teams hiding in the bushes. My daughter's in kindergarten. At one point, the speed limit in front of a high school goes down to five. Five! Okay, if you don't step on the gas pedal, the car does seven. I can't even make it to five! I can do spurs of seven! Seven stuff! Seven stuff! Seven stuff! Or I could just open up the door and put in neutral and roll the guy then, and throw like the flitz-dance! That's why I think the school's speed limit passing. Every school should be directly correlated to how well the children are performing at that school. Right? Come on. Motivation for kids. And it helps you house haunting when you have to know what a hurry is at a good school district. Well, they are doing 85 past the high school. I do appreciate it coming out, because come on, let's be out. You got a lot today and now, where we live, a lot of entertainment choices. Netflix alone, come on! By the way, where Netflix can be toned down a little bit with people ran and ran around how many options. Netflix has so much to have so much to have. Netflix has a lot of shit that you have to sift through to get to the good stuff. Have you ever scrolled through to movies and Netflix? No, it don't take long before you ain't sniffing a movie star. Oh my god, man, there's not even a bold one brother in any of these. Is that my name? I read it! Is Larry in a movie? I picked Baby Larry's in a movie! That's why when you get a good recommendation for Netflix, it's like a drug. I come home, I'm telling my wife, are we going to do this? You sure you want to watch it? Apparently we're going to stay up late, we're going to blow the kid off. What do we always say? We'll watch one. We'll just watch one. It's a problem. You try to watch one on these shows. You go Netflix, you try to watch one, and you go to bed. And you go to bed, the screen's like next episode. Five, four, three, two, one. Next thing you know, it's four in the morning. I'm like, no season two, come on! What are we doing? When I get into something, man, I have to hear every line. Like I'm watching a movie recently, and the guy leaves the room. He said something, but I don't catch it. It's a turn to my wife. I'm like, what do you say? She goes, I didn't hear it either. I'm like, well then why are you asking me? She's like, you don't have to hear every line, Pete. I'm like, I don't know why you left the room. I don't know what's going on. I got a rewind. For all the money Netflix has, they got to work on the rewind fest. Foward, man. Just trying to go back a little. I'm like, all right, stop, stop! Why is she yelling at me? You going all the way back to the beginning? Oh, God, here we go. All the way back. Opening credits. I don't know why. I don't think what you think he said. Matt is so much bullshit. Can't believe this. Now I'm fast-forwarding and I'm like, all right, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! I'm just yelling at me. Here we go. We're seeing the whole thing. All right, here we go. The whole goddamn movie. Everything ending credits. Put something else on now, if we just saw it. Ten minutes later, I'm finally getting it right where I want it. In my head, I'm like, well, man, this guy better say something really important right now. He's like, goodbye. Okay, he's leaving. He's not coming back now. I know he's officially not. We're watching a movie recently. A one-point, the woman turns to the man and goes, well, you know what they say behind every great man there's an even greater woman than my wife paused the movie? I knew she would. I knew she would. I'm on the edge of the couch. She's like, you hear that behind every great man? There's an even greater woman. I'm like, well, I am wallowing away in mediocadille over here. So, I want to step up. I'm watching a movie about two months ago. I go to have my ice cream. That's my snack. Freezer burn. Oh, you have no idea, man. That's my Saturday night, man! So, I'm like, all hope is not lost. It might just be a top level. You still got to do a deep dive. And as I'm sticking to Spoon, you can hear all the crystals breaking up. I'm like, all the way through. All the way through! My wife goes, well, just calm down. Just put it back in the freezer and we'll return it to the supermarket. I'm like, grow man, do not return ice cream. It's just like, well, I guess you just have five bucks. I'm like, well, you do that, right? I guess I'll just have to shop with five dollars worth of shit next time I go to sleep. Not all at once. Like, I was in the bakery section. You know where you get your donuts and you put them in the white wax bag? I got four donuts. I put them in the bag. I get them to the register right away. Right, right away. The lady's like, how many donuts in the bag? I'm like, two. You have no idea how scary that is until it's actually going down. Oh my God, man. I was like, I was trying to get heroin across the border. I'm not ahead of my god. Just swipe the bag, lady. Swipe the bag. Swipe the bag. I'm walking out of my wife's whisper and it's 55 cents a donor. Why would you even put us in that situation? I'm like, is it a freezer bird? Nice cream. Keep walking. Keep walking. I'm around the parking lot and she's like, what would you have done if they opened up the bag and swallowed for donuts? I go, I would have just been like, my wife must have put two more donuts in there. What I wasn't paying attention. I mean, it's called acting. Really, man, I don't know why we're so enamored with movie stars. We act every day of our lives. Better than they do. Hey, come on. How many people you're going to work? You see someone you don't particularly care for. You're like, good to see you. And you're like, you too. And scene. Calling it sick for work. That's some of the best acting work we ever do in our entire lives. I was writing on a sitcom last year. I needed a particular day off. You know that way. You need a particular day off. And you're like, I could ask for that day off. But if they don't give it to me, I'm still not going to be there that day. So I'm going to have to go with a call and sick. It's going to have to call. It's a burden. It's on your own personal calendar. I got it. That's the day I got a call and sick. That's the day I got to do my three day acting toilet. They force. Because when I call and sick, I don't just call and sick on the call and sick. I start acting sick around the office two days prior to the call and sick day. You have to have like it'll be like a few days before you're going to start pretending you sick. It's the work front that's going to hotel in this happen one time. The guy on the way he's like, we're going to be alone on Sunday. And I was going to call him sick Sunday. It's just going to be me and you on Sunday. I already took a look at the schedule. We're going to be getting slammed. So make sure you're ready. I go to him yet. No, absolutely, man. I'll be ready. I'm going to be double ready. You have no idea how slammed you're going to be on Sunday. You feel bad. But you can't tell him. He always want to be like, yeah, I just want you to prepare for the storm. I'm talking calling and sick on top. That's what I do three days prior to the call and sick day. I start acting a little sick. Little things and a little cough here and there. Normally I drink coffee, but instead I have tea. There were a hard dip with the bag until someone sees and looks and then he sees this. Somebody's like, you're drinking T.P.? I know you have coffee usually. I get it now. Some of my throat. I know. Some of his going down. And scene. What time I was acting sick though? The guy's like, well, man, you sound bad. You should probably go home. I think you're getting sick. I'm writing my head. I'm like, no, no. I'll be sick Wednesday. I'm fine today. Wednesday. Wednesday. I don't act much while I'm all really in movies and TV. I did a show once and a director apparently was at the show. He wanted to meet me in the green room. I know like he's a fan of yours. He's a important guy. I had very little time. I couldn't even Google him. So I walked in to meet the guy and he's like, hey, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Big fan of your work. That's what you say. That's what you say. He's like, thanks. I'm a real big fan of you when you're stuffing me. He goes, do you do any acting? A lot of acting. Like, what's the last thing I may have ever seen you act in? So he said, I just want to be like, hey, this room, two minutes ago. I said I'm a fan of your work. I don't even know who you are. And you bought that. So we're good. I got it. I get out. I don't think because the accent, that's why I don't really do a lot of acting. I don't mind. I mean, I have a very thick. Can you tell me, can you tell him from Kansas, sir? I don't mind ever my New York long-eiling accent. It is what it is, baby. But let's be honest, you know, the minute you start talking with this accent, nobody other thinks, oh, it is a genius. I wish I could lose the accent sometimes. That's all. Like, my wife and I went to get a mortgage on the house, we had to get a bank loan before we walked in. My wife goes, when we go in there, try not to sound old gumbah. I was the note, don't sound gumbah. Right away the bank lady comes up, she's like, good afternoon. I'm like, hey, how you doing? Yeah, that's just a walk away to get some. My wife looks at me, how you doing? How you doing? What do you order in a Peshrami sandwich at a deli? You got the house, you got the movie, we got my five-year-old daughter-man, we moved to the small town, started new in the small town, she's in kindergarten now. Any parent knows, you know, you love when your kid comes home and they act like they've learned something at school that you don't know yet. Let me talk to me wrong, my third grade, that'll start happening, I'm aware of that. But I'd like to think I would be the valedictorian of kindergarten. But they had a five-year-old come to the school, now my daughter comes home, I'm having dinner and she's like, that, when there's a fire, you stop, drop and roll. And she said it would such conviction. I had to be like, yeah, no, if it's near you, absolutely. But if it's upstairs and you're downstairs, you know, then you just run out. She's already at that age, giving me the lip, no doubt, you stop, drop and roll. And I'm like, yeah, if it's near you, my wife goes, guys, you're just telling you what to do. Like, yeah, and I'm telling her, man, it's nearer. I can't just agree with her, little grease, she's got to know what's the deal. I'm gonna fire all my friends and run it out and she's rolling around like a goddamn pimple. Everyone's like, what if a coriallis kid, you wouldn't get up, she's just kept rolling around. Like, one of those vacuums that eventually gets every crevice. Now more than ever, we were in to it with the safety with the kids, right? Like, I got these two big porches. I got this old Victorian house total money pit of a house, man. My daughter and her friends, they'll sit out on the porch, people jog by when they just yell out high until the person says hi back. My name is, I think that safe. I'm saying hi to everyone. I'm like, oh god, what do you want me to put chicken wire around the thing? You got to admit though, right? I mean, like, I'll see these headlines where it says attempted child abduction, attempted, like they didn't get it done. I don't want to sound crass, but I mean, if you can't get a kid into a van, seriously. You know what you need to get my daughter into a van? A van. That's it. Catch it. Pull up, you open up that van though, I should be right there. What you got in there? What you got in there? It would be more difficult to keep her out of the van. Let me give it a light shove. Get away from the van kid, right? A cop would pull up what's going on. I'm trying to drop off a cop at the kid keeps trying to climb into the goddamn van. Everyone has their own methods of dealing with trying to help keep their kids safe. I got something I got to share with you. I call it the inappropriate touch test. No, because that's my big fear, right? The kids get touched. I told my daughter, if anyone ever touches you, sticks their hand down your butt, you stop and yell, no, no, mommy daddy, run away. We do dry runs around the house. My wife and I will be having coffee, my kid walks into the kitchen, I put my hand down and butt, she goes, no, no, mommy daddy! And she runs away, she comes back, we fist pump blow it up. My wife goes, she's got it down. Come on, yeah. I think I got to run or run a real track now. She's got the drill down, right? My wife's like, she's got it down. She's got the drill down. That's what she's got. That's what, you know? And then my best friend, since I was a third grade, him and his wife came to visit last summer. They have no kids. Spent two days with us, went to the beach one day. Now it's the next day. He's met my daughter now for about 24 hours. We're making dinner. I'm explaining my whole inappropriate touch test tool. Of course, he calls me sick bastard. Let's get that out of my way. My daughter's on the iPad, I go, I need you to go over and just give her a little rub. Be perfect right now. By the way, little side note, any parent knows that iPad, whoa, I could give my daughter the iPad and I could go to Miami for the weekend. That's not even an exaggeration. So my buddy goes up and just he goes, oh, what up, I'll do it. He just gives a light on the back. He's like, hey, what are you doing, sweetie? And she goes, that tickles. I can walk it out of Kitch and I go, no, it's no, no, mommy, daddy. Right? And she goes, no, that's all game, dad. My buddy goes, I think you got a bigger problem on your hands now, bro. Right? That's all I need is my daughter in school on a rainy day. The teacher's like, does anyone have any games you play at home or you family? Sometimes my dad sticks his hand down my ass. Then we fist pulp and blow it up. Teachers like, all right, everybody heads down. I have to make a quick phone call. That's down. That's down. I don't know. I like where I live though. Beatnicky, beatnicky. I got a neighbor who's an artist and I went to, he's a painter and I went to like a show with his paintings and some others. That's a tough racket, man. I mean, I tell jokes. If I tell a joke and you don't laugh, all right, I suck. Clear. Cut try. I go to see this guy's paintings, right? He's got a beautiful painting with a tree and this and that. There's another one next to his. His is going for 400. The other one's going for four grand. I'm like, who decides? And then like there's a curator that like looks at them and makes a decision. If I was a painter and I did the 400 all the one, right away, I'd be like, where's the fucking curator? Get the curator. Get the curator. I got a tree. He's got a tree. He's got a son. I got a son. Who is this guy that just decides? This curator is like Picasso. Perfect example. Did everything Picasso paint? Was it just automatically a masterpiece? Really, he would just take the brush. Call the Louvre. Don't Pablo's got another one. Jackson Pollock, the drip guy. Right? I mean, are you kidding me? This guy wasn't a good painter. He painted, he painted, finished the painting and it wasn't that good. And then he looked down at the floor and said, the floor looks fantastic. That's what he did. The trippings. I'm not even kidding. It was a documentary with Pollock. True story. He called his wife from upstairs to come down after he did his first drip painting. And he said to her, is this art? Ah, guy, if you got a ask, you already got your answer. It's a goddamn drop cloth. And the curator came in and said, to masterpiece! Everyone's like to masterpiece! Everybody's still dripping, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip. It's a crazy world, that all world. They take as long as they want, right? You can't tell an honest how long to take. Oh, what the job could you do that? You got to plummet come in, you go, how long is this job going to take? You imagine if you plummet one, two days, two weeks, two months. When I feel it. You were negative energy just added six months to the project, I'll tell you that much right now. Michael Angelo took 14 years to paint the Sistine Chapel. 14 years to paint the ceiling. You think that was in the contract? I mean, after the third year, he must have been walking in there with Sprint like, oh god, here he is again, what the fucking line? This is yelling up, we're just wanted and why? What the fuck, guy? He's like, you're going to love it! You might be dead, but your family, they will love! That's how he times really talk over there when we're not there. Well, let's be honest, you know, as far as painting the ceiling of the chapel, everyone, anyone who's Catholic, really any religion, but I'm Catholic and we all know churches need to be aesthetically as beautiful as possible to get through the hour. We need as much shit to look at to get through one hour. I just stare at the ceiling, so I'm like, oh, those custom bells, look at us. More importantly, was that 30 seconds I just better write this, stare at the ceiling. We're going to church a lot now, because my doughnut is five, my wife thinks it's important. Four o'clock mess every Saturday. That's when we go to church. We're going to take the funnest day of the week and slice that shit right in a half. Even into summer! Come on, have you ever been in church and you can smell Bob Acuse? Why are you in church? Shit! We've been at the lake and my daughter and the lake and my wife are yelling, guys, come on, we gotta go to church! I'm running out of water, go and don't yell that shit out. Wow! Know how weird you sound? Even if Jesus was in the water, he'd be like, fuck it, we're not doing it today. Got a hot game of Marco Polo going on right here. The first time we brought my daughter to church, I don't shave that often and we walk in and there's a statue of Jesus with the beard and she looks up at the statue and she yells out, daddy! I think of my wife, I go to kid thinks I'm Jesus. My work is done. These priests not know we can't wait to get out of there. Like did they not know? Have we been so polite that nobody has ever told them? Because they show no sign of realizing we can't wait to get the fuck out of there. Right? It's amazing! Close my mind, I mean like, has anyone ever been in church where the priest goes church has ended and seen someone go, come on, no five more! Five more! Five more! We just want the bread and they just want the money. That's it. I need the body of Christ. Especially if you have a big week, it's like a rabbit's foot, it's good luck. I need the bread. I got a lot going on this week, I need the bread. That's the thing when you go to church, at least to my church and you go to get the body of Christ, the bread. There's two lines. One is the priest, another line is some guy in a men's warehouse suit. Never's just some dude in a cheap suit. And he's going out the bread too. I always tell my wife, don't get the bread from the guy in the suit. It's not as powerful. What is he even doing? Who is that guy, right? I've been coming out and be like, have you read a Benny Han and you got the Asian guy slicing up your food. Benny walks away and another guy walks up, hi I'm Keith, I'm going to be finishing up here. I'm not Keith, I need the guy with the pain, it's the whole thing, Keith, it's the whole thing. The guy in the cheap suit usually, the guy later run, gets the money. Churches do it two different ways. Some churches do a basket hand from person to person. That's a little more civil. My church does the stick on the end of the basket. So the guy does the line. And if you don't put in, he eyes balls you for two more lunges. I'll be back for you, I'll come back two more times. He's pretty stoked, don't they know we would go to church more often if they would show it in need man. I cursed in church last Christmas Eve. I literally cursed, I walked in it was a full choir that's not normally there. I see the whole choir and I go, oh shit. I'm going to write it as why you don't like the music. I go, no, I like the music if it's going to take away from the priest walk time. But if the music is going to be tacked on to the entire mass then shut the music down man, shut it down. If I was a priest I would do that, it's a little gift to my parishionist. Every once in a while I would have a really short mass. And you never know when it was coming. That's what would make it so exciting man, just be driving a church. I hope it's wanted a short one. I'm talking super short man, I'm talking five minutes before church starts. I'm looking at the author boy and the organ guy. I'm like start up the organ, get the bread ready. As soon as they come in we're going right into the bread. Imagine as soon as you walk in the priest is like this is the body of Christ. Everyone's like holy shit, keep your coax on. I'm going to be out of here in five minutes. I do a drive by with the bread once a week like a bank every Wednesday five to seven. He just pull up the whole family in a call like when you go to a right aid for drugs the priest I just get on to my company got in a car for give me four pieces of bread. I just handed through to call I bless the whole car for there you go. I ended up in a graveyard with my daughter. We had a let me cook this one. We're on a three bike ride. I have my daughter on the back of a little trailer hitch thing in my wife was on another bike. My daughter fell asleep and then I got a flat tire. So I told my wife, all right, I'll undo this. You take the bike back. I'm going to take her. She's still sleeping. I'll walk her through this old graveyard on the old cemetery. My daughter is still sleeping. I got her in this little back trailer thing on the bike. And then we get in a cemetery and I'm waiting for my wife. I don't even get to treat my daughter wakes up. Now when she fell asleep, she was on the back of a bike. That is no bike, no mom. She's in the middle of an old cemetery with big giant angel statues. And then she sees that dad sitting against the tree ten yards away. I couldn't resist man. I just looked at her and I'm like, we died. This is where you go and you wait for Jesus. My wife comes walking up. Hey guys, she's like, I said we died. My wife's like, what the fuck is wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Curse it in a cemetery. Get it together. Get it together. Oh man. I like the small town living though. Sure nice, Bex. I got a mouse. I had a mouse recently. You don't even see the mouse at first. That can't be the only one. I see the mouse droppling on the kitchen counter. I'm looking at my wife and I'm like, did you have a bagel? And you know it's not poppy seeds. You know it's not as you're saying it. The mice know this shit everywhere. I always wanted. Right? Like you think the mice are ever looking through the hole watching a set up the trap to like, they're setting up the trap again. How the hell they know we're out there? The other mouse is like, cause she's shit everywhere Phil. She's freaks. Why don't you just leave a goddamn map? Is that me? I don't even know what I'm doing. I need one of those things that the horses have in central park. That's what we do. We set the metal trap. We put a little peanut butter on the end of it. I'm talking 10 days straight. I wake up. Peanut butter gone. Trap's not snap. So I got to go to my local hardware store. I go see Tommy with a double E. That's what it tells you when you're meeting me. It's like, it's Tommy with a double E. I wasn't going to send you a Christmas card, but good to know. I told him my situation. He said the traps not snapping because my mouse was too light, which was a little hot that on the stand considering the mouse had gone through a jar and a half of Skippy peanut butter. You would think it would be a little carved up at this point. It must be on a little treadmill in between a sheet rock banging out three miles a day. He says, I got to put down a glue trap. Now, I don't know anyone in this room has ever used a glue trap to catch a mouse knows these glue traps need to come with a little warning sign that says, are you emotionally prepared to see this through? Do you understand? It needs to come with a diagram on the back showing a mouse wiggling. Did you just don't think about it? I come down the next morning and I see something I'm like yelling at my wife. It's a lot. My wife comes in with both looking at a wiggle and she's like, oh my god, we have to help it. That's what you say. I go, well, I mean, technically we're trying to kill it. That's what you mean, right? But helping you mean killing quickly is how would you mean? Then she goes, let's fill up the sink and then we'll dunk it in the water and the sink. I'm like, you want to waterboard the mouse? But she goes, God the hell with this and she grabs a knife and a butcher block. I've been married almost 20 years the entire time I thought my wife was Polish in this exact moment. I'm like, oh, this broad is Russian. She's been lying, man. Then she turns the knife to the doll side presses it against the mouse's neck and with her free finger she pets its head. While she euthanizes the mouse right next to the toaster. This is more than I signed up for on a Wednesday, man. A couple days later, I'm back in the hardware store. I see Tommy would have double-ed. He's like, you get a mouse? We got one. Is there kind of you know there's not more? I'm like, bro, even if there were more, once they all witnessed the execute. There's no more mice in Ferdinand. I'm an animal guy. Come on. I got married my dog. We had a dog. We had to bury it in our backyard illegally. We go out now every Christmas Eve. We start our tradition. We light a candle. We sing a few Christmas carols by the dog's grave. My father heard me say that too, right? He goes, when I die, he'd come to my grave every Christmas Eve in light of candle. If you're buried behind my garage, yeah. It's not forget the convenience factor going on here. The Christmas tradition. My wife loves Christmas. This past summer she goes, she literally goes, we have to start thinking about our Christmas card. We always make a funny Christmas card and she's like, it's going to be cold before you know it. Winter's coming. I'm like, listen, we got a thought thinking about a new roof. Prioritize. So the hack at this old Victorian house, my roof was such a nightmare that whenever there was like any kind of a wind storm, my roof shingles would end up in my neighbors yards. Like my one neighbor came over one day with all my roof shingles in a bundle. Kevin, my neighbor, Kevin's like, just, this will fell in my yard. I just want to bring you back to roof shingles. He leaves him a wife goes, that was so considerate of Kevin. I'm like, considerate, that was Kevin's way of saying, fix your white trash piece of shit. Ruth, are you kidding me? Read the room. My Kevin's back to his wife right now going, yeah, drop the shingles right on a fucking porch. If they didn't get the message now, they never will. So I call three different roofes to come take a look at my roof. It's got three different levels. This old Victorian, I'm not kidding you. Every one of these roofes in one form or another said my roof was too high. But the last guy, he didn't even get out of the truck. He just looks up and he goes, oh yeah, I don't go that high. I go, no bro, that's my line to you. I say, I don't go that high. So I called you. Can a roof even say that? Can I report that shit? Like if the roof was down here, I wouldn't need you. I would do it myself. Or I would call a flora. That would be like an exterminator coming out of your basement going, oh, it was a big bug. That dude a little bugs. Gotta call a big bug guy. Gotta call a big bug guy. I literally didn't know what I was going to do, right? Then my father-in-law tells me that he knows an old-time Amish guy that used to do roofs. He doesn't know if this guy still does roofs, but he's got a phone number. And he said, but when you call, you got to let the phone ring for a long time. They got one phone on a pole in the middle of their Amish community. And eventually somebody will come in today. I lived in New York City for 22 years now. My wife and I are calling an Amish guy. I'm telling like 24 rings. My wife goes, anything yet? Anything yet? By the way, am I talking? Am I fucking talking, Batman? I couldn't bite my tongue. I'm like, yeah, no, he picked up. I'm just ignoring him. But she goes, well, we're on it. How many rings are we on? I'm on 32 rings. I don't know. Is this a lie of rings? I don't want to hang up. And then talk to a guy who knows Amish people. And he goes, you hung up on 32 rings? No, it's got to ring like 50, 60 times. The Amish guy answered on like ring 38. 38 rings. The Amish guy answers like this. He goes, hello. Like it's a breezy Sunday afternoon. And he quoted on ring too. Just to, hello. If the 38 rings don't you expect someone to answer out of breath? Like, you know, oh shit. I was running through a cornfield. Let's go. I can't believe you let it keep ringing. Fucking hell. So I tell him my situation. He says he can come take a look at my roof. But you know, he can get to the Home Depot parking lot. I got to pick him up at the Home Depot parking lot. He's the level of Amish where he can't drive a motorized vehicle, but he could be driven in a motorized vehicle. Pretty convenient level of Amish to be. Sounds a little bit like built in an Uber from where I'm standing. How do we sign up for that shit? I love to have that being Catholic right? You're in a bar for them. Bill, you give me right home. I mean, I drive myself a fucking pope in the new rules and shit. So I hang up right away my wife goes, wait a go. You didn't figure out where you're going to meet him at the Home Depot. I go, well, I guess I'll just have to look for a guy dressed like a pilgrim. Come on. That guy's going to be in an Adidas tracksuit. Oh, there you are, but I didn't see you stretching open air. There he was with the hat and the overalls, the beard, the whole thing right? I guess in my 2006 Subaru Outback. It's like 72 degrees out, but I put the seat warmers on anyway. I turn the air condition on, radio on. I'm doing the wipe of fluid. Any technology I had, I was firing it off. Just my subtle way of saying, look at all this shit you're missing out on, God. What are you doing? It's crazy. Telling you, if I was driving a Lexus or BMW, but at the time I hit my driveway, he would say, I can't take it. I quit. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm, man, but I'm driving. I'm a guy too. It's like, I could have took me straight home. I went down Main Street, even though I didn't have to go down Main Street. But you got an Amish guy in the car. You know, that's like having a deer in the car. I just wanted to see one buddy to give me that look. It's, uh, it's okay. I see my buddy at the ball, and he'd be like, was there an Amish guy in the car? I saw it, I saw it, I wanted to see it. I saw it. He was in it, he was in it. I went pulling him to my house, right? Three roof is bail on this roof because it's too high. The Amish guy gets out. When I would skip in a beat, he looks up at my roof and he goes, you do have a ladder? That could get me all the way up there. I go, no man, I don't have a ladder that goes, hey, do a ladder that could get me up to your porch roof? I said, yeah, no, I got a ladder for that. So I get the ladder. It climbs up to my porch roof, right? Then he leans down, he grabs the ladder. He pulls it out, puts it on the roof and a porch. Climb up to the next level. Grab the ladder again. Holy shit. I can't even look at this point. My insurance doesn't cover this shit. I got a body who owns a car wash in town. He lets me throw stuff in his dumpster from time to time. That's what's going through my head right now. I'm like, if this Amish guy falls off the roof, I'm wrapping him in a top and I'm throwing him in a goddamn car wash dumpster. He's got no cell phone on him, he's off the grid, nobody's gonna know. It's no different than throwing a possum in the dumpster. Then he gets up to the top level of my roof and like a billy goat in seconds. He shimmies up to the highest peak of my roof, leans against the chimney and lights up a corn cob pipe. I go running into my wife and like, get the camera. We got the Christmas card. We got the Christmas card. Thank you so much for coming out guys. Thank you. You guys are the best. That's so much fun. You
I don't know, man, but I do. I love my family, man. I come from a great family, man. I love their wonderful people. I just, have you ever been on one of those family vacations that sounded really good until you got on the vacation? And it's a shit show. Has anybody been on a cruise? Has anybody ever been on a cruise? Royal Caribbean, go fuck yourself, man. I got dudes. Have you seen the commercials? Holy crap. Hot girls at Bikini stiving in the pools. Well, we hate kids playing on deck. Happy, good-looking people interacting with each other. None of those people are on my boat. There were 5,000 people with 75% body fat. Strafted divas handles look like they're baking bread right there on their feet. With little corn chips dangling off the end. Feel my pain, feel it. And they're just fucking sweating across the deck every day. You know where they're going? They've got damn buffet. That's all anybody who does his eat on these phones. 24-7, man. I walked into the gym. Ghost town. There's dust on the treadmill. But every fat ass in America ran into Scooter right around the top of that ship. Looks like NASCAR on the Saturday. Eight days. Eight fucking days. Oh, and there's this one guy, man. I love this guy, man. His name was Bubba. Bubba, shit, you know. Bubba from Arkansas. Bubba was about 5,6,380. Or cargo shorts stuffed with Reese's in case of an emergency. My brother and I would wake up in the morning to watch him eat at the buffet. He would stack a plate like an art form. He would have scrambled eggs as a foundation. He would put egg rolls as little columns all around it. Put pizza on top of that, like ice cream and everything. And then he'd put a diet coke under his arm. Bubba, you got 82,000 calories there. Drink the fucking coke, man. If people always say, don't worry about the room. Don't spend your money on the room. Just talk to you. Spend every nickel you ever earned. Spend your kids college fun on that fucking room. Get something with the window or a balcony. I was in one of those holding cells on the inside of the boat. Four by six room two cups. Orch jumpsuit hanging in the closet. And there was a drain in the middle of the room. And to God I thought that's where you peed the first three days I was there. Did he find the bathroom? This fucking closet tucked behind a door. I'm shit like this for five days. Oh my God. And you start to hate people. You hate people. You see the same faces every day. You're like if I see you up by my door one more time I'll stab you in the fucking neck. I swear to God I will. I'll burn those lower than flies. Can't you drag around this boat? That's why they have short scursions. If you don't know what short scursions are, they're time out. So we all don't shiv each other on this goddamn boat. We went to Mexico. What a shit hole this place is. Mexicans I get it now run jump swim. Get the fuck out of that place man. It's stitties. And we were in Cosmelle which is the French Riviera this dust bowl of a country. And what they do man is you're sitting in your room. And they have these little bitty TVs and they play these subliminal messages over and over to get you to go on these short scursions. Like you're just sitting there all day long it's like do you want to go to the store and clean it back to come? Like I'm tomorrow because I'm going to make it back to come. Ooh you should go to the store and make it back to come. My brother and I are sitting there going do anything to get off this fucking boat. What do we got to do? This was the commercial a swear to God word for word. I memorized it. It must have played a thousand times. Are you ready to go strong Lincoln Mexico? You'll be picked up on a 50 foot camera. If you sail across blue waters you'll have a boat's coral reef swim with pretty tropical fish. That's not what happened. No. Five Mexican guys with an Australian accent. Big us up on a 10 foot trash bar. That's all I can call it. It looked like the POW ship from Waterworld. Remember that fucking thing? And I'm picturing this beautiful island and everything. We're 10 feet away from the cruise ship. They lower drawbridge just start fucking kick the fuck. We're out there swimming through diesel fuel. The water looked like the bottom of a dumpster after Marty broke. There's no fish living in this water. You couldn't see a reef if it was in front of your face. I saw like a half eaten box of adult diapers and a bunch of chicklets floating in the water. Oh! And then we went to Jamaica. Oh dear, what a wonderful place that is. If you're a criminal, they got four year olds with glocks tucked in their diapers. Man, smoke and cigarettes. Fuck yeah. We had this couple man. We had this old couple that stayed next door to me and my brother. They were so nice man. They must have been on a thousand cruises. And every time we would stop somewhere they'd come over like Julie Cruz director, knock on the door and tell us what we had to do. So we went to Jamaica and they're like, oh my god, court. We are in Jamaica. You have got to go kiss the dolphins. It's only $250. I'm thinking $250. This dolphin better have no teeth. Swim up, suck my dick when I get this pool. I live in California. That shit's free bitch. My brother and I want somebody to casino right. Let's go get our dick sucked by dolphin. But I got to tell you about this man. We went on this excursion thing man and you go. We get in this bus with about 25 people. The driver has a gun on his lap. We go through three goddamn war zones to get to this aquarium. And then you come off this bus and you go to this hallway. And you go in the water. The water is way steep. They hit you with life vest like you're going on the goddamn Titanic. You got this huge life vest on it. Everybody waits into this pool of dolphin shit. That's all I can do. It's disgusting. One of the dolphins had a cold sore shit. You know, it was disgusting. And there's all these people standing and they just parade these poor mammals by like they're Singapore sex slaves. And it was just molesting of one by one. And the guy next to me turns to me and he goes, Whatever you do, don't touch the dolphin's penis. Like the last day of what's a picture of my man, a meat jacking off a dolphin. You
Look here, if your mother fuckers ready to laugh, let me say hell, yeah! Yeah! All right. What's up, man? Get this mother fuck off with like, old gay scientists. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! My friend, the only one that didn't yell is, should I send your mother fuckin' ass, man? Gay scientists probably invented Dixon home. Yeah. She has. Got on that old ass, silver-right suit. Like you'd rather hear from a fucking rally. Bit of laugh. What are you doing? God damn! I wasn't boosted by these fine ass women in the front. Didn't be gas-legs, girl. You never kick me in ass. It's a damn shit. What the fuck are you laughing at? Big thick glasses you got on, shit. Yeah, I look like she's lookin' through an aquarium. Take that shit. Oh, that's a damn shit.

I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all. I'm telling y'all.
I still remember when I first decided I wanted to do comedy. I just graduated college and I remember telling my mom who's from Compton, very hardened by the world. I remember telling her I wanted to do comedy. She goes, why? And I go, because I've never felt better than when I could bring different people together. And I remember her just going, oh baby, that's the softest shit I've ever heard. I was like, oh cool. Great. I want to go home. Thank you. Seriously, thank you. How sweet was that? Jesus Christ. I didn't know how weird it was to tell people I was from Florida until I moved. We got a reputation, y'all, it's bad. You know what I'm saying? Because we're a weird place, like, let's be honest. Florida is like the Kanye of the 50 states. Like, let's be honest, you know? It's like when I was young, I loved it, but the older I get, the more I'm like, I mean, I don't know if I can defend everything it's doing. You feel where I'm coming from? Florida and Kanye just have so many similarities when it comes to like, how hard they are to root for. Does that make sense? It's like, yeah, they're both creative. They both love women with big booties, but they both try to make the Confederate flag cool. It's like, ah, mistakes were made. It's tough thing to defend. That's all I'm getting at. I still get defensive for Florida. When I'm on the road, I actually do. I get defensive all the time. I just don't like when people try to make it sound like all the crazy shit in the country only happens here. I'm like, get the fuck out of here with that. Let's stuff acting like you haven't been in your hometown and you're walking down the street and you saw some dude that made you go, oh, Jesus Christ, boy, that fucking guy. Oh, my God. Was his dick sticking out his back pocket? Jesus, you saw that, right? It's just crazy to me. And then people try to cite Florida man stories as if that's the end all be all. Get the fuck out of here. They're like, what about Florida man? I hate that they say it as if all the other people in Florida aren't reading it, thinking the exact same shit as that. I'm like, what about Florida man? I'm like, what about that nigga? He's crazy. What about Florida man? He's out of his mind. I agree with you. It's so weird that they bring that up. You know what I mean? Because I just, what's the easiest way to explain this? It's just with Florida man stories, they don't make sense to me because they make it sound like, like, what do they think we're thinking as we read it? Like we're not relating. Like none of us are reading the Florida man story. All these crimes are going nice. He finally did it. Oh shit. Oh, yeah. Dude, follow your dreams, baby. Jerry always said he wanted to throw an alligator through a drive-through window. And they told him he couldn't do it, but he persevered. So ridiculous man. And then you'll hear people say, like, these dumb arguments, they'll be like, well, if our states are so crazy, why don't we hear as much about us? I asked a prosecutor. I'll tell you what. Did you know that everything that goes to court in this country is public record? Anything that goes to court, you can look it up if you know how. But, and this is what I didn't know, every state uses a different site. And it just so happens according to this prosecutor, Florida has one of the easiest sites to search public records for, even if you have no experience looking up public records. So you could do like a keyword search. You could go, meth, eat, face. A case in Florida is going to show up. But you could do that exact same search in another state. The case exists and it doesn't show up unless you know how to pry deeper to make it come out. Do you understand what I'm saying? The other states aren't less crazy. They're just better at keeping secrets. That's all it is. They're Bruce Jenner. We're Caitlin. That's it. That's literally all we're talking about here. And I just don't like when they try to make it sound like it's only here. Have you read your news? I have. I've checked your sites and you've got some shit going down. Have you seen this guy in Colorado who tricked out his bulldozer into a tank and he drove it through the houses and the businesses of everyone he thought wouldn't support his muffler store? You want to talk about Colorado, man? You see this guy in Massachusetts literally living in the walls of somebody else's house would only come out at night to pretend to be the ghost of the dead mother of the two little girls that live there. We don't want to shout out. I'm like, Massachusetts guy. That's all I'm saying. I'm not saying if you're from another state, you're a bad person, but stop acting like it only happens in Florida. People are fucking dogs where you live too. That's a weird point to rally a crowd around here. Oh my God, dude. It does feel good to be back, man. There's people everywhere though. Be real. They don't hide behind the state lines. They're like, no, we're everywhere. You see the story about this cop in St. Louis? Cop in St. Louis sued his own precinct because his boss told him on the clock, by the way, tone down your gayness. That is a direct quote. Tone down your gayness. His boss said to him with an HR department, are you out of your fucking mind? But that was a direct quote. That's what he told him. Cop sues the department. He wins the case as he should, by the way. You know unless he was awarded? $19 million. You hear what I just heard? I can tell you what I just heard. I have not been acting gay enough at my work. $19 million, you said I will do some almost gay things. For $19 million, if I was like, cop, you wouldn't even have to ask. I'll put rhinestones on my handcuffs. I don't give a shit. I'll do whatever I got to do. I'll start mason everybody with bathroom body works. What's the thing? What do I got to do? Everybody I bring to the precinct smells like apricot. I don't care. I'll get you Miranda right to wrong. I'll be like, you got the right to remain steamy. It's $19 million. You're not going to do whatever it tastes. I'll chase the siren of my cop car to a Ariana Grande song. I don't give a damn. You saw me chasing you down the street. You just hear bang, bang, hands on the roof. Like I'm going to go, fuck. What are we talking about? It's $19 million. I'll spit on my night stick before I use it. I'll be like, what seems to be the problem here? I'm just saying that's a lot of money. I'm not gay or cop. I want to be both of those things. Crazy people everywhere. That's the only point I'm trying to make here. I don't like how people try to make Florida sound. Like I live in LA now. I've been there for five years. The number one question I get asked when I tell people I'm from Florida. They go, oh, you're from one of the messed up schools with a teacher's of fucking the students? I'm like, wow. What? Fucking the students. I mean, yeah. Twice. And they're like, that's funny to you. And I go, it depends on the situation. And they're like, when's a teacher sleeping with a student ever funny? And I'm like seventh grade. Seven grade, it's real funny, man. I'll tell you real story. You can look it up on our site. When I was in seventh grade, we had a female teacher who slept with a male student. That's true. Class she taught, hardest math class we offered in the program. Student she slept with? Smartest kid in the class. When the rest of us students found out what she did, none of us were like, how could she do this? We were all like, fuck, we should have studied harder. Oh, you're telling me that's who was at stake the whole time? Understand the point I'm trying to make here. I'm not saying teachers should be sleeping with students. I'm saying I've never been more motivated to learn. You feel fresh? She's giving out Felatio for ratios. You think I'm not going to learn this material? Probably studied for that class. I was in eight mile. I'm like, you only get one shot. You not miss your chance to. You think I know Pythagorean theorem? Because I care with the hypotenuse of a right triangle. You better grow up. I was trying to lay teenage hype. Can I say some wild shit? Hear me out for a second. I'm just saying, if we were more open-minded, we might have more kids that were caring about their education. You know what I mean? But when I will not do what it takes. If you fail a class, of course, you get summer school. But if you ace a class, come on. Homer school, what do you think? Felas, you're not intrigued. I know this doesn't work for you. But Felas, you're not intrigued a little bit. If a blowjob is waiting for you at the end of it, you would have paid a little more attention in geometry. That's all I'm getting at here. You can turn the whole game. You're like, what's your cool? I love the dynamic there. Nerds are cool now. Imagine you walking down the hallways. You got point-dexter glasses on, pocket protector. Buccane calculator watch. All the jocks are staring at you. Damn, she'll be getting all the blowjob's man. He's crazy, though. I keep trying to learn algebra, but my dad keeps making me practice quarterback. The fucking dork. Right? This is just so cool to take in. It's a safe, fine. I just want to live in it a little bit. I've written article a while back. Always stuck with me. This company did a study where they said only 30% of people in this country actually get to do their dream job. Did you know that? Only 30% of people in this entire country get to do their dream job. When I think about that and I see that y'all came out, I'm just grateful y'all came to support my backup plan, y'all. This was not my dream job. Don't get around. My career's going great. I'm happy. But this ain't what I dream. Get the fuck out of here. I never dreamed of telling people how gay I'd get for $19 million. Yeah, yeah. I wasn't a kid just staring at the stars one day. They're going to know the price. But I was going to the NBA. The NBA. The NBA they had another thoughts. I still remember when I fell in love with basketball. I remember the day. I was like, I'm going to do this. Five years old. Five, never heard a basketball. No one had ever introduced me to it. I get taken to a game. We get to sit close. I mean, close. Like, close enough to like, you get to see the game that you don't get to see on TV. You know what I'm saying? I still remember this is Clear's Day, right? I saw Player A, foul player B, heart. And then I saw a ref call a foul on Player A. And then I saw Player A turn to the ref and go, I suck my dick and I was like, what game is this? What is this? A five years old, my mind's blown. I'm like, you can do that. I remember I look at the guy sitting next to me. I go like, he just said the thing. Is he not going to get in trouble for that? And the guy next to me goes, nah, he's going to be fine. I'm like, what game is this? I want to do this when I grow up. What is this? The NBA might be the wildest workplace in America. We don't even talk about it. Think about what you've seen them get to do. Cross-reference it with your job. Tell me their equals. Get the fuck out of here. I just saw a guy tell a coworker suck my dick and everybody who saw it went, you know, hey, yes. What? What a free workplace. And I'm just saying, there's something to it. The NBA is just a place where you could just sort of get away with almost anything. And I'm not saying it's always got to be bad. You could just sort of do anything. It's got a place there. When I was growing up, there was a player named Jason Terry, his nickname was the jet. And anytime Jason Terry hit a three-point, and you know how he'd celebrate? He'd spread his arms. Like, they were the wings on a plane. And he would just run back down court as if he had flown away. He did that for 19 years. I need you to prompt 19 years of a guy running through the office. Aaaaah! Nobody stopped him. Now once, nobody was like, Jason, what the fuck are you flying? They could get back on defense. We're still playing. Not once for two decades. God, I want to do that so bad. I just love the idea that he got to do that for fucking 19 years. Oh, oh. It's all I've ever wanted to do. You can't do that shit in comedy. I couldn't drop a punchline and be like, later, you know what I'm gonna be like, what the fuck are you doing? It's all I ever dream of doing. I just want to tell somebody to suck my dick and fly away. That's all I've ever wanted. I want it for everybody. I tried. I tried. Dude, I tried to get to the league, man. I tried so hard. I really thought I was going to the NBA. Closer as I got was a white girlfriend. I wasn't really. I remember the scouts were like, that's a good start. Now, next, we want you to stop this guy from scoring. I'm like, I'll try, but I'm better at the first thing. Get up, y'all. Let's gaze this for a second before I add. By round of applause, how many people here have ever dated somebody of another race before? Who's done it? Yeah. Okay. That's supposed to be. All right. But you're not a villain if you haven't. This isn't going to be one of those things. I'm just trying to gaze this before I ask, all right? For those of you that have dated somebody of another race, you've never gone out with that person and then you ran into somebody who just assumed that's all you're into. But you get what I'm saying with it like, oh, you got a thing? You're like, oh, I didn't know I had a thing. I run into it all the time. It's one of the biggest things in my day in life. People are always just like, JB. Yeah, JB only likes white girls. I'm like, that's not even true. I do like white girls, but I like women of every race and then they'll get defensive. They're like, well, then why have your last six girlfriends been white? And I'm like, because that's who said yes. So I can do. It's like, what Marty will want for me? What am I supposed to date six black women that said no, we've got our Kelly. What am I supposed to do? You feel me? Sorry, I'm not the king of R&B. I just don't understand why you getting mad at me, man. All I can do is shine the bat signal. I don't control who shows up. This is how I played out. But I'm from this out. I still don't understand for the love of me. I don't understand how in this day and age, people still have an issue with interracial dating. Like, sure, plenty of people don't. But you know who I'm talking about. Plenty of people still do. And it blows my mind that that's still a thing. What's wrong? I can't even imagine. What's wrong with two cultures coming together? You know what I mean? It's like, teach me about health insurance. I'll teach you how to duggy. Like, who's losing? Who's losing? Like, I don't even understand the logic of it. What's wrong with mixed kids? Mix kids are just white kids that don't sunburn. It's going to be all right. It's just black kids that go to supercuts. You're going to outgrow it. My guy ain't going to. You're going to overcome. I just don't understand why we can't have a more honest and open conversation about interracial dating and why it's not a threat to anybody. It's so bizarre to me, you know? Like, I still think about, listen, man, if I had a baby with a woman of any race, I would love that baby to death. To death. But if I'm being honest with you, if I had a baby with a woman of another race, I would still be really fucking excited in the way I could be excited about that. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm living it up. I'm taking advantage. Bro, I'm naming that motherfucker blade. I'm calling him day walker. I'm doing all the things. Bro, I'm picking him up off the operating table. All of their strengths. None of their weaknesses. Like, I'm living it up. It's all love. But I'm basking in what it is. You know what else could I do it? It's just so weird when people try to confront you for dating someone who doesn't look like you. It's like, how is this even an issue? It's even more weird when it's your own people. It's like, how are you who I'm arguing with? I'll give you a story. A long time ago, this is years ago when I lived in Tampa. I remember I went to a mall with my girlfriend at the time, right? My girlfriend was white. And she was my girlfriend is still white, to be clear. It sounded weird in my head. I'm pretty sure she's still doing the white thing. So we're at the mall, right? I remember she saw something in a display case that she wanted to check out. She goes to check it out. I don't go with her, right? I kind of just hang back. I just do a general scan of the room. I'm just checking out where I'm at. You ever just look at, what's the best way to check out? You ever just look around in the room, you're hanging out? You're just checking out? You ever accidentally make eye contact with a stranger? Like, you ever hold each other hostage? You know what I mean? You're just like, why? Well, we look away. What are our motives? You know, you're just caught in that moment? I lock eyes with this black dude. And the only way I can think to describe him is too excited to see me. That's the only way I can think. He's because of what he did. This is what he did, right? We lock eyes. And as soon as we lock eyes, he goes, what the fuck is that? The fuck is that gesture? Who do you do that? Not a stranger? You don't do that to a stranger? Who was that for? Like, you know, you do that when you catch Michelle Obama at the strip club. You're like, no, no, no. You feel me? But not me, you ran them black man across the way. But that's what he did. And I just go like, OK, all right, you won that contest. I'm not going to really be staring at you any longer. And I wait a couple of seconds. I peek out the side of my eye. And I'm like, oh, shit, he's coming. All right. This dude is coming to me. Walks up to me. This dude said one of the most confusing things I've ever heard in my life. To this day, I'm so curious to see what you think of it. This guy walks up to me. I swear to God, so kind of, he goes, hey, brother, I ain't trying to start nothing. But you know when we see you out here having social intercourse with all these other races, you look racist. And I went social intercourse. Have y'all ever heard that term? I had never heard social intercourse? That's an aggressive way to say hangin' with friends, isn't it? I didn't know hanging with buddies could sound so sexual. I didn't know I was such a heart-throb in the social community, yeah. Apparently, I lost my sexual virginity when I was 17, but I busted my first social note when I was like four. I had no idea there was such a difference. So I go social intercourse. That's a weird word, man. He goes, call it what you want, what you're doing is racist. And I go, racist? And he goes, yeah. And I go, let me get this straight. It's racist for me to be out in public with somebody of another race. And he goes, mm-hmm. And I went, you got to give me a sec, man. I never heard somebody be this wrong before. It was like 2012. I'm like, who hasn't seen, remember the Titans by now, my guy? How are we struggling with this? But he doubles down. This is why I never forgot it. He goes, no, what you need to understand is when we see you walk it in public with somebody of another race, it looks like you're embarrassed to be black. And I was like, what kind of mind fuck is this, my guy? Did that make sense to any of y'all? Okay, because the damn shit didn't make sense to me. I'm gonna talk about it. I just wanna make sure we're on the same page before I get far. Let me say a couple things. Nobody of another race has the power to make you feel embarrassed of your own race. Let me make that very clear. You feel about you the way that you feel about you. You know what's wild though? You know who does have the power to make you feel embarrassed of your own race? People in your own race. Isn't it wild how accurate that is? We've all got representatives that made us go, no the fuck you don't speak for me, the fuck out here with that. What? We've all got those. You ever heard Kanye? Are you always relating or you're like, what the fuck he just said? Remember when he said slavery was a choice? Do you remember how many black people came to his rescue? Me neither. That's my point, dude. We cut that thing off like he, like subway to Jared, but you do remember how we handled it. We were like, he did what? Did we just prove? Oh no, no, no, no, no. The actions of this individual do not reflect. We cut him right out. Can I give you an example for white people? I can't speak for you. I'm just throwing it out there. I think this is a great one. Let's see how you do. Remember when George W. Bush was president? Remember that? Remember when we did that interview. He said this verbatim. He goes. Shame on. Shame on you. You fool me. Can't get fooled again. That's a direct quote. That's a direct quote. I had to Google that to make sure I got it right how wrong he said it. And all I'm saying is if you're a George W. supporter or not, can we just agree that you didn't feel well represented? That's the point I'm getting at. I think we all heard them. You can say that a little better, I think. I want to run that one back. So what have we learned? Somebody of another race doesn't have the power to make you feel embarrassed of your own race. Somebody of your own race does have the power to make you feel embarrassed of your own race. Did you know there's a third thing? Did you know somebody of another race does have the power to make you feel more proud to be your own race? You ever seen somebody do something and go, oh, glad I'm me. We've all done it. It doesn't make you bad but it's something we've all done, right? And that's what I told this guy. I said how can I be embarrassed to be in black when this white woman actually made me feel more proud to be black than I've ever got to feel? Oh, that fucked him up. Oh, you could have saw his face. What? And he goes, how? And I go, how what? He goes, how could a white woman ever make you feel more proud to be black than you've ever felt in your life? And I went, I tell you, she gave me a blowjob during the movie Django Unchained. Like I need you to really process how special that is. You get what I'm saying? Like, look, that ain't an oppressive. That's a freedom fighter if I've ever seen one. You ever seen somebody fight racism? Like it's a snake bite? She's like, calm down. I'll suck it out. I'm like, what the fuck? Bro, you all don't know pleasure. I don't care what kind of sex you've had. You don't know pleasure until you've got to watch a slave master get shot while getting your dicks sucked by somebody that looks like his daughter. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me. I wish my ancestors saw that moment. I wish they were looking down from heaven. Well, look at that. Well, how about going to get a young man? Got what in ally? I still don't think she's getting enough credit. If I'm being told, I don't think everyone's really processing what she did. What a moment. Historically. For race relations, are you processing what just happened? We should be teaching students about her in textbooks. Do you understand what that moment was? It should say Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and Brittany with an eye. It should be all over. These were freedom fighters. They all had very different tactics for fighting racism. One guy was like, turn the other cheek. Another guy was like, fight fire with fire. Brittany was like, blop, blop. Blop. Blop. Blop. Love Brittany. I just don't think she's getting enough credit. That's all I'm trying to say. She deserves a little more credit than she's getting. Just imagine. New enough white women in here. Put yourself in her shoes for a second. Imagine you see a black man who's upset over slavery. And you think, I'm gonna change that. And then you do. But you understand what I'm saying? I used to hate slavery movies. Oh, what a fucking bummer. And now any time one comes out, I'm like, oh, date night. Baby, put your nice dress on. 13 years of slave just came out. Yeah, 13. It's a sequel. Yeah, they franchise it. They're doing the whole thing. Get that throw ready. I heard it goes up to 400. It's a great history joke. As a person who is a proud black man that's unwavering. Not ashamed of where I came from. I'm not ashamed of who I am. But I grew up in mixed neighborhoods. I went to mixed schools. I played for mixed sports teams. As far as I'm concerned, I'm the product of what this country is actually supposed to be. I'm trying to love everybody. That's where I'm coming from. As a person who is actively trying to show love for everybody. I hate it when I see us getting arguments that are meant to divide us by race. Does that make sense? Where it feels like whatever powers that be are more focused on splitting us apart than showing us a way to come together. And I just find it frustrating. Especially when it seems like the answers are so right there in front of us. If we just took the time to listen to each other and realize we actually agree on way more than we disagree on. I'll give an example. I mean that. I think anytime I see somebody get offended at the concept of white privilege. I don't understand why they're upset. Because it's not an attack. And I think it keeps getting mistaken for an attack. I don't think people understand what it is. Right? By definition, privilege is just when the world allows you to do something specific, easier than someone else. Doesn't mean it was easy. It's just easier for you than someone else. That's it. By that definition, we literally all have privilege. You understand what I'm saying? We just have different privileges. So that's why I don't see why it's something worth arguing if someone brings yours up. Because we all get our turns for it to be our thing. So you can't be like it doesn't exist. Of course it exists. You don't think there's black privilege? Fuck, I love black privilege. Did you know I could go to any white wedding I want? I can go to any white wedding I want. Hop right on the dance floor. Start doing every dance moves I want to do. Everybody at the party's got to be like, he's good. That's black privilege, man. Doesn't matter what I do, they think I'm good. Let's take black people out of it, right? Take them out of the equation. Let's give another example. Let's say hypothetically we're watching the national spell-in-beat. It's only two kids left. There's a white kid and there's an Indian kid. Be honest with yourself. Your life's on the line. Who you putting your money on? That's Indian privilege. You feel me? Let's say hypothetically after this we go out to drink. We're having a great time. We're partying, we're being married, we're getting to know each other. Two random women just start making out out of nowhere. Oh, they are fun. Then two random guys start making out out of nowhere. Oh, they are gay. That's female privilege. Do you understand the point I'm trying to make? I'm saying privilege exists in every direction. And the only thing I'm trying to add to this conversation is if you just stop getting defensive when yours gets brought up and you start being willing to have a sense of humor about yourself, you would start to notice how funny all of this can be. And isn't the world better with people who are willing to have a sense of humor about themselves? So just be those people. That's all I'm trying to say. You cool? Thank you. Can I give you an example of white privilege that makes me laugh? I love you. It's not an attack. Let's see how you do. I think white people are the only race of people that like to be scared for fun. Like you feel me? Not an attack. Doesn't make you bad. Makes you interesting. But not bad, but bungee jumping, skydiving, swimming with sharks. These are torture tactics. Some of you pay for them. I just think white people get to have a different relationship with fear. Doesn't make anyone bad. I think it's an interesting observation. White people can have a different relationship with fear. I think white people are the only people you can walk up to and just be like, hey, you want to do something scary today? And y'all won't just outright say no. You feel me? You'll be like, what do you got in mind? You feel me? You go to anybody of another race. They're like, fuck no. But white people have follow-up questions sometimes. They're like, well, what are you thinking? Okay. Look at roller coasters, right? Theme park owners know white people love being scared so much. You'll pay for a picture of your own face terrified. That's their business model. That's how reliable it is. They were like, yeah, that's where we're going to get the rest of the money. I've been in so many white homes and seen a framed picture. The entire family terrified. Why? Why is that even a thing? I haven't been in one black family's home. And seen a picture of four black people absolutely terrified. And they're like, yeah, that's the time I got stuck up at gunpoint right there. That's us. This is where I tried to sell my kids for my own life. So wild to me, man. And I'm just saying what I'm saying, because I understand I'm generally speaking, right? I'm speaking in generalities. I understand there are special case scenarios for everything. So please, like, I'm not being irresponsible with this. Just be on the same page with me. I'm just saying generally speaking, though, that kind of holds true. I'm saying generally speaking. I feel like white people feel fear so rarely. That y'all scheduled it as a vacation activity. Like, you feel it? I was like, literally put it on a schedule. You're like at 12. We're going to have lunch at one. We're going to pet a tiger. You're like, what the fuck are you talking about? A tiger. Huh? You know what? No one black has ever said to me, I want to go on a safari. Now, once, I got so many black friends, no one's ever wanted to go. It's our country, and we're like, nah. But I have so many white friends that want to go. It doesn't make them bad. I'm just saying it's an interesting difference that you can spot and go, oh shit, okay. Why doesn't the safari sound insane to everybody? I didn't realize it was something we were so polarized on. I thought we were all of the same mind. Like, that's fucking crazy. And apparently, we don't agree. I never understood why this is crazy. You want to go to the zoo without the walls? That's what we want to do. You want to take away my favorite part of the zoo? The part where they can't get me? That's where we're taking away? Oh, all right. Every time I go to the zoo, people are looking at the animals. I'm looking at the structures. I'm like, that's a good wall. Like that net. Love that glass. I've never understood it. Why doesn't a safari sound dangerous to everybody? It's not even a safe web browser. You feel me? You ever open up safari in front of somebody with Firefox? What the fuck are you doing, man? They make it sound like you just fucked a hooker with no condom. They're like, we'll close it. Throw it away. Who knows what's in there now? It's so wild, man. I'll entertain it. Like, I'll talk to my white friends. Their defenses are so bad. And I'm not saying these are all white people's defenses. I'm saying you wouldn't want to be represented by my wife. That's what I'm saying. The stuff they argue, I go, hey, that's a bad one. They'll be like, just go on a safari. You're going to be fine. I'm like, based on what? They're like, you got a tour guy. I'm like, that nigga's not a wall. It's like, what are you think is going to happen? If a lion saw us and was like, oh, I'm about to eat these motherfuckers. You think he's just going to be coming at you? I'm going to be like, oh shit, they brought the guy. God dammit. Hey, wrap it up, guys. They brought the fucking guy. You don't think the lion just sees more than a lion? I'm going to be like, what's the problem? I'm going to be like, what's the problem? Hey, wrap it up, guys. They brought the fucking guy. You don't think the lion just sees more food? That's what I can't get. That's not how your brain works. You think of a lion saw a black tour guy and two white tourists. You don't think he's going, oh shit, dark meat and mashed potatoes. Oh, fuck. Looks like KFC came to me. What are we talking about? What do you think the tour guy's going to do? Entertain it for a second. What do you think that's just a guy on the clock? You think that guy actually cares about your livelihood? A lion's coming at you all he sees it? You think this dude is just going to step in the way? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, lion. No, no, no, no, lion. Not today, lion. You eat zebra lion. Zebra black and white. These people just white. No goods. No goods. That's why we bring you mixed kid. Blad. Blad. Where has Blad gone? It's so fucking stupid. It just makes me laugh. Like I'm just fucking around, but you get where I'm coming from, right? Like you get the point I'm getting at. That's all I'm saying. I just think fear is such a great example for us to explore the country. We're all just trying to explore the concept of privilege where everybody can see it and realize no one's the villain. But you can identify the differences. I just think it's a great example, you know? Like I, can I tell you something real wild? I got a wild theory. I think I'm on something. I just don't know how to prove it. But I think I figured something out. I think I know why each race has a different relationship with fear. Especially fear for fun. I think I can see what it is. It's kind of a wild theory, but I think I'm on to it. I think if you come from an oppressed group, you've never been so bored with life that you're willing to risk yours. Does that make sense? Like I don't know Jews that like escape rooms. You know you came to a comedy show, right? I'm not running for office. I'm not the guy. I'm just here to make the funny points. I think I'm on something. I don't know Jews that like escape rooms. I don't know black people that are in the bondage. Whips and chains, you said. Fool me once. I don't know any Mexicans that want to do a tough mother. That's a real good one. Like if you know what a tough mother is, that's all I'm pointing. If you don't know what a tough mother is, just around the same page. A tough mother, it's one of those races you do out in the middle of nowhere. It's a foot race where you're just going through an obstacle course. You're going through like water hazards, running over hills, running through like electrified fences. I don't know one Mexican who's like again, yeah, for sure. Yeah, let's do it. Get the fuck out of here. I did that to get it. And I fit in fuck out of here, my God. All I'm trying to get at here, I'm not trying to attack anybody. I just want us to understand this concept better so we can get past it. Right? Anytime I see somebody online or on TV or wherever, say that privilege doesn't exist. I need you to understand, you're not a bad person. But you are wrong. All right, I'm not trying to come at you. But you are actually wrong and you sound ridiculous to people who do understand. Just take the time to understand. All right, privilege exists. But I'm a six foot three black man. There's not one person in here that thinks my dick small. That's my privilege. I get big dick privilege. Doesn't matter if you're right or not. You didn't think it. That's my privilege, man. If I was an Asian comic saying all this same shit, you wouldn't have thought the same thing. Beyond, there's not one woman in here who's been at a bar, seeing an Asian dude and been like, oh, he might dick me down. And he might, he might do it. But you weren't thinking it. That's my privilege. I get big dick privilege. It's a hardship. I have to work over every day. Try to overcome. But when you say privilege doesn't exist, you know what I always think of? It's always this story. It's such a banana story. When I was a kid, I remember telling my dad what my dream job was. I told him I was five years old. I told him I wanted to be in the NBA. My dad is a black man from Alabama in the 1940s. He's not a big dreamer. It's a very practical man. His vibe is more like, survive. I'm like, okay. That's what he's like. And I remember, I told him I wanted to be an NBA player. You know what he told me? Just have a backup plan. I was like, God damn, can I dream for a little bit? I'm five. But that's what he felt like he needed to communicate to me based on his experiences in this country as a black man. Fair enough, I accept that perspective. I hear you. Meanwhile, my best friend, next door neighbor. I was there when this happened. I remember seeing him tell his dad what he wanted to be. He said that he wanted to be the first black president in U.S. history. You know what his dad told him? Anything you put your mind to, you can achieve. Isn't that beautiful? But that kid was white. Don't tell me white privilege doesn't exist. My God, I was there. I saw this shit with my own eyes. I saw this white father. Who is a good man? I still talked to him to this day. See his white son look at him and go, I want to be the first black leader of the free world. And with me still in the room. He looks at his son and goes, well, if you just work hard enough, I'm like, get the fuck out of here. Tell us, get no. Tell him that one's not for him. Couldn't do it. Privileges just such an interesting topic. And I don't want to harp on it too much longer, but I just want to drive this point home. Okay. I do feel like if we're being fair to both sides, there are privileges that white people do get attacked for. And I don't think it's fair. If we're being critical to both sides, when we're trying to come together, right? I do think there's one thing I've seen y'all do that I do find very funny. And I hope you find it as funny as I do. And I don't think it's fair that you do get slack for it. I do think white people are the only race of people that I've seen get offended on behalf of a group. They are not a part of. Like, you know who to picture. Right? That's all I'm saying. But here's the thing. You know what to attack you for. Because I believe at its core that's something of goodwill. That just mean you cared for another group of people. You were trying to speak on their behalf because you thought you were doing right by them, right? That's a good thing. That's nothing to attack you for. It may not be the way we want you to do it, but that's okay. Right? And here's the thing about it. It's a really complicated situation. Because if you look online, you see this happen all the time. White people will do something on behalf of black people. Black people go, don't do that. And then white people go, oh, my bad. What would you prefer me to do? And black people go, I don't know. And they were just left nowhere. But both of those sides are fair to be clear. Those are both fair dispositions. Sometimes it's hard to come up with a resolution. You just know when someone isn't doing the right one. That's fair. And it's fair to care and not know what to do. So it still leaves us in the same place of what do you do when you're trying to have someone else's back. I think I came up with something. Hear me out here. All right. Listen, I think this is a universal way to show support for a group you're not a part of. You can use this in any group. I don't know anyone who had turned us down. And I don't know what you do after this, but you can always start with this. I'm giving an example. As a black person, if I'm there, I don't like it when I see somebody white till somebody else white that they can't say the end word. Because that's my line. You feel me? That's what I get to say. Are you trying to upstage me, man? This is my big moment. You know what I need you to do? I need you to say motherfucker after my line. That's support. You get what I'm saying? Dude, I get to go, you don't get to call me a nigger, and then you come in like, motherfucker, and I'm like, okay, so now I feel strong. I feel supported. We're a team. You feel what I'm saying? I'm done with allies. Be my motherfucker. I need more lows. That's what I need. Because I don't think there's anything scarier to a racist person than a black man with a white army. He'd be like, oh, fuck, his cause must be good. I think that's actually scared. Stop being my ally. Be my motherfucker. I don't know when I started caring about all this kind of shit. If you saw my show like five years ago, I was talking about nothing like this, you know? I don't know what happens. I got a little right there. I started boating. You started boating. I'm going to throw some opinions out of here because I'm here in some wild shit. It's weird as you age the way your priorities change, the way your life changes. I'm not trying to be like, age and sucks. I'm cool with it. But it is weird the ways in which you age that you didn't anticipate. Does that make sense? Those are the ones that are weird for me. Like the regular one, like my knees are sore. I got to wake up early. I'll probably go to a matinee. Like those are the, I find. I was ready for that. But the weird ones where I'm like, nobody told me that was part of it. What the fuck is going on with me? Like I heard the other day, I heard a rap song. I couldn't relate to one part of. I was like, what the fuck was that? That's a weird moment itself, real estate. Look, I don't know if you've ever been black before. I've done it my whole life. If you hear an entire rap song and you end up going, shit, I don't think any of that was for me. What a weird moment in your black existence. I was like, where do I fit into this? I still remember what the guy said. I swear to God, I think you're relate. Yeah, I remember he went, I got an actress on my mattress. I'm going to hit it three times in one night. That's a hat trick. And my brain just went exhausting. That's all I felt. Three times in one night, I was like, not for me. That's crazy. Three times, brah, you don't got work in the morning. Nobody's pussy's better than sleep. I'll tell you right now. And that's not an attack. The older you get, the truer that rings and you fucking know it. That's not an attack. Ladies, I'm sure your pussy's great. Sleep is good. I like sleep more than sex and it ain't even close. I know that. You know, I like sleep more than sex? I go to sleep every day. I'll miss one. I only have sex sometimes. And even when I have sex, when I'm done, I'm like, God damn, I want to go to sleep. If that's all about me, you had been like, I got an actress on my mattress. I'm gonna hit it one time, then I'm napping. That's my entire... I'm like, yo, this... Hey! Trying to hit them nightquill bars, brah? I just think it's so weird to see the things that make you change as you get older. I think it's weird to look at other people your age and see the shit they care about versus the shit you care about. You ever seen that? You're on Facebook and you're like, what are they fucking random about? You ever have those moments where like, this is the hill you want to die on? This is the cause you stand for of all the things? Have you seen this group of people that's trying to get Disney's Snow White cancelled? Oh my God, I'm losing my mind over it. There are adults, our eight voters, people whose votes count the same as yours. They're out here trying to bring down a cartoon. They're so dedicated. Have you heard the argument? She never gave consent to the kiss that woke her up. That's what they're arguing. Now listen, I'm not trying to be on the wrong side of an issue. I'm not trying to sound like I got some hot takes. I'm just saying, you've all seen the movie, right? We've all seen Snow White. All I'm saying, it really feels like they're leaving out the whole, he did it to save her life part, huh? Is that not a crucial detail in the context of that circumstance? Like if you were the prince and that happened to you, wouldn't you want to confront her? Like, hey, you want to explain the rest of that though? So I'll sound like a creep. Appreciate that. You got me out here sounding like Bill Cosby right now. I'm just saying that dude was putting them to sleep. I'm just waking them up. This is a totally different thing. I don't think you should be allowed to make someone who attempted to save your life out to be a predator. That's the only line in the saying I'm drawing here. I think that deserves to be defended. If I tried to save you, I'm not a creep. When I was a kid, when I was seven, right, I grew up in Tampa. When I was seven, I was at the beach. I remember I was swimming in the ocean. I'm swimming poorly if I'm drowning. Let's be honest. I'm drowning. I'm for sure drowning. I passed out. I sunk onto the water. I had to be saved by a male lifeguard. I said, you know, I woke up on the beach. Two in male lifeguard giving me mouth to mouth for cessetation. And when I came to, I completely understood what that situation was. There was no confusion. I wasn't like, oh, Nick, I'll see you in court. Okay. You ever heard of me, too? We'll meet three now, bro. I just think it's such a weird circumstance to like, this is the hill you want to die on for this argument. Not against consent culture. I'm asking, is this where you really want to make you stand? Within this premise? That's what's odd about it to me, you know? Like, have y'all gone back and watch the movie? Like, as adults, is weird, man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. I'm not a real man. It's weird, man. It's real weird. Do you remember what the curses? True love's kiss will wake her up. That's real specific. Like, they really narrowed down the danger that could have come. You got to be pretty sure to go for it. It's not like they went, hey, man, first one of kisser gets the keeper. Then a bunch of dudes started marching to get to her first. My hoe, my hoe. Back up. You got it. You got it. I'm just saying it's just such a weird place to make your argument. I can understand. To be clear, I can understand where you're coming from. If you were just like, I just wish it wasn't a kiss that he had to do to save her. I can appreciate that. I'm just saying, but can you stop making it sound like he squeezed the titty when he did it? That's more, right? That's more, I'm coming. I'll make it very clear because this is a tricky topic to make jokes about. Obviously, at the end of the day, I understand my place within this premise, right? I'm a man lightly making jokes about sexual assault. I understand that. And I can never put myself in the position of a woman in relation to a topic like this. I understand that. All I can do is empathize the best I can from the perspective that I have. And that's as a black man in this country. And I'm just saying, as a black man in this country, I don't get what you're talking about. Let me say hypothetically, right? Hypothetically speaking, I'm an acoma. I'm dying. And you say the only way to save me is for a white dude to whisper the inword in my ear. What do you see what I'm saying? Here's the kicker. If we're being honest, I don't need him to ask for my permission. My life's on the line. They're bigger priorities at hand. Do what you got to do. But I don't care if you're whispered. Get on all fours for all I care. Nigger. Nigger. I mean, hey, I heard you the first time. Steve got down. Can you give me a sec to wake up? I take a second. No, I appreciate what you're trying to do. But we're going to talk about that second one. You don't get to call me two niggers and then y'all would say, look at my army for me. Oh, look at that. That's how you fucking do it. That's a weird example. Let me give you a better one. That's what I'd see what you were going to do. Let's say hypothetically, I'm an acoma. And I'm dying. And you say the only way to save me is true loves kids. Just like the movie. I assume y'all would want that handle the exact same way I would want that handle. I would want somebody to go round up everybody in town, form a line, take my weekend at Bernie's body, prop that shit up in a kissing booth, put some cool ass shades on that motherfucker, look back at the line and go, all right, everybody would I hurt because it goes first. You feel me? You feel me? Is that not what you want? Like, let's be real for a second. I want to make it very clear, I am not against consent culture. On the contrary, it couldn't be more for it. But that's not the place to make your stand. I do think after all of the allegations we've heard from women over the last couple of years, men should be making more of a point to showcase to women how much we do have your backs, how much you are going to see like a change in the behavior you've been encountering, even if we're not the individual's responsible for it. What I'm getting at is that we need a show that we have your backs. You feel me? But the question then becomes, how do we show you that? Here's what I'm pitching. Men, start making consent your biggest kink. Take a sec, process what I'm saying. Start making consent the kinkiest shit that you're into. Start being a fucking freak for yeses. You feel me? Like after the Me Too movement show on what you've learned, anytime a woman goes, how do you like it? I'm like with permission. Like I lean in. I lean in. Bro, I don't unzip it till you say please. You could be like, get over here and fuck me. I'd be like, hmm, is that how we ask? At this point having sex with me is like binge watching Netflix. Every so often I interrupt the flow just to be like, do you still want this? Yes or cancel? Are you awake? I'm joking, I fucking ran. It's a good question asked. This is all I'm trying to get at as a whole, right? Like I think it's very clear that I'm a liberal person, right? But if I could say anything in an effort to bring us together, whether you're conservative or whether you're liberal, any of that shit, man. Like all I'm trying to suggest to bring us together is that if you look out at whatever's going on in society, the society, the culture that you are in and you feel change coming, you're certain. It's coming no matter how you feel that is going to be a regularity. It's not going to hurt you to learn something so that you can be a part of it. You understand? You don't even got to believe in it. But you're going to have to coexist with these exact same people. It's not going to hurt you to understand their stuff better. Does that make sense? That's all I'm trying to get at because when you don't know what you're talking about, it's fucking jarring. And I just need you understand, stop being that person. We've all done it. Why are we continuously trying to do that again? I was in Kansas City a couple months ago. I flow in to do a show. I get off the plane. I order an Uber. I get this alert on my phone, this notification, it says, Frog will be here in five minutes to pick you up. I'm looking at the picture. It's a picture of a woman, right? It says Frog. It's a picture of a person I believe identifies as a woman. Let's be honest, right? But it's Frog. That's what it says. I'm not reading it wrong. It's not a tough word. Frog. I'm thinking about it. I'm having this debate in my head. I'm going to be like, I mean, she ain't hurting anybody. It's a non-binary name. No one's getting hurt. If you want to be called Frog, you're frog. I accept you. Frog, I can't wait to meet you. Put my phone away. I go out. I wait for the car to show up. She pulls up. I open the car door. I lean inside and go, hey, how you doing? She looks back and goes, rib it. I went, nope. Close the car door. I'm going to be like, oh, no. I'm going to be like, oh, no. Too much progress in that car. You're doing what I'm saying. I'm not saying she did something wrong. I'm saying I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready for the journey frog was going to take me on. But had I done more research, who knows where we could have ended up? I don't have more story because I was ill-prepared. That's all I'm getting at. It's not going to hurt you to learn. Some progressive things. They're the wildest shit you've ever seen. But they're kind of cool. I did a show in Denver once. One of my best friends lives around the corner from a club. We do a show. We come out. It's 11.30 at night. I'm watching him walk home to his house. You've got to go around the corner. As soon as he gets to the end of the street, this is going to sound made up. This is exactly what happened. As soon as he got to the end of the street, I saw 17agers all on scooters, like bird scooters. They ride from around a corner. They ride up to them. And then they just started circling around them. It's one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen in my life. In real time, in nature, this is happening. They just wrote up to him. I watched seven children kidnap my adult friend. And I had no idea how to advise him. He's like looking back at me. And I'm like, I think they got you, man. I think they just got you. I've seen animal planet. I know this isn't a good thing. I don't know where it leads, but I know you're not bad. You know what they started doing? One of the most bizarre things I've ever seen in my life. They just started bullying in him. Like verbally bullying a grown man. I'd never seen something like this in my life. They just started going, you're gay. You're gay. Can I just say side note to see anyone riding a scooter going, you're just, what are we, what? What am I looking at? Look, I'm not against you, but come on. This is, huh? You're gay. What? I'm seeing seven of them do it. And they just keep going, you're gay. You're gay. And what this dude said back, y'all, I'll never forget this rest of my life. This might be the most progressive thing I have ever heard in my life. They go, you're gay and he goes, that's your opinion. And I was like, what the fuck was that? Did anybody else know that was an option of things? You could say back to your gay, that's your opinion. What an insane way to win the argument. Because he won. Be clear. That was a victory, but like that? That'd be like if somebody called me a nigger and I just went, to each their own. What? That's what I saw. You know what I learned? Did you know that no one can insult you if they aren't convinced that you understand that was an insult? Did you know all you've ever had to do was say crazy shit back? And no one could ever hurt you? Dude, it happened to me every day. Something you called me a jungle monkey. I was like, to make it a tomato. It's like, how do you attack that guy? You feel me? Something's like, you a little pussy boy. I'm like, that's the way to cookie crumbles. You can't get him. You know? Something's like, you can't read. I'm like, you're not my real dad. I love it. I just don't think progress is such a bad thing when you start to understand it more. That's all I'm really getting at. That's all I'm saying. I'm not trying to sway it. Whatever you vote, you vote. That's what you do. I'm just saying I don't think it's actually that bad a thing when you just have an open heart to it. You go like, oh shit, is that what's going on? One of the things I hate is like when we get labeled as a whole. Like as a liberal. When people go like liberals. You know what I mean? Libdars, all that shit. And you're like, we're just going to be like, yeah, that's me. I hate it when we get lumped together. Is it for not all individuals who have their own minds, who have their own string of logic, who have their own priorities? That irks me. You think all liberals agree? We don't. We bicker all the time. We don't have the same priorities. That's crazy to me. I'll give you one of mine. Look, I came from Florida and then moved to California. I thought I was liberal. And then I got there. And I was like, ooh, I'm liberal for Florida. It's a different thing. It is a different thing. You know? Here's my big one. I don't understand how drinking from plastic straws equals eye-hate turtles. It's too big a leap for me, man. There's just, there's too much in-between there. I don't hate turtles. I'm just too black to care about this right now. I've got my own things going on. You know what I mean? That's all I'm getting at. No one saying green lives don't matter. But black lives called it first. And you can get in line. I've been here a while. And just to be clear, you ain't next in line, turtles. We still got women and gay people. The Amazon rainforest was on fire. You gonna be here a while, turtles. I just don't understand that notion. No one's saying we should care less about turtles. I'm saying we should care more about me. And I can't believe I got to make that case sometime. Like, okay, let's say hypothetically. If Martin Luther King Jr. was still alive to this day. And he saw how gung-ho we were for saving sea turtles from plastic. Wild racism still exists. Don't you feel like he'd be like, you motherfuckers have got to be good and married. Like, like on some level, that do be upset, right? That's all I'm saying. So we can sense it. I hate that I have to defend myself from these straw people. I don't know what else to call them. Like, I've been called out seven times for it. Seven. I'm counting. Seven times. I've been in a bar. I'm sipping on a sprite. Some woman walks up to me. She's always white. But she's always, it just is what it is. I'm not saying she's bad, but why is she always white? She comes up to me. She confronts me about it. Did you really need a drink from that? I go, I'm sorry? Did you really need a drink from a plastic straw? I don't even listen. I just take a knee. I'm like, I'm not going to be a part of this. I'm not going to. I'm just going to do it. She doesn't get to say that. Like, I understand. She cares about turtles, but that's not your fight to bring to me. If a turtle came up and was like, you can't drink from a plastic straw. And then she was like, I'm going to drink from a plastic straw. And she cares about turtles, but that's not your fight to bring to me. If a turtle came up and was like, you can't drink from a plastic straw. And then she was like, mother fucker? I'd be like, OK, I'm wrong. No, I'm wrong. Fuck. No. Shit. But that's not what happens. I just don't get it. It's not fair. You don't get to decide how I feel about turtles. You don't fucking know me. You don't know what I've done. I give you a crazy story. And as a kid, I had to stay with a family member who was requested to stay anonymous in this story, because I told him it was going into special, and he was like, I need my job. You'll stay anonymous, my guy. But he should be ashamed of himself. I stayed over his house for a summer. He has a pool in the backyard. It's one morning, we wake up, we look in the backyard. There's a pool. Excuse me, there's a pool. There's a turtle wandering around me. There's a turtle wandering around the pool. It's just a regular turtle to be clear. It's a turtle. It's not hurting anybody. It's not like a big turtle. It's not smiling. It's just a turtle. It's just wandering around. You'd have thought this dude had just stumbled upon an actual home invasion. He's like, what the fuck? What the fuck? Who the fuck does he think he is? I heard an adult man say that sentence about a turtle. Who the fuck does he think he is? About a turtle? He storms off to the phone. He calls up animal control. I shit you not. He goes, y'all need to get this fucking turtle out my yard or I'm a shoot it. He started the conversation with that. Not who he is, not where he's located. None of that information was important. They need to know if they don't get this fucking turtle out his yard, he's gonna shoot it. I hear the woman on the other side of the line. By the way, I'm seven. I'm watching this like adults are crazy. I hear the woman on the other line. You know what she does? I shit you not. I can hear it. It's so funny. She just goes, good luck to you, sir. Hangs up the phone. I was like, oh! She called his bluff. I watched the... I swear to God, I watched an adult man have a fucking meltdown. Actually, I knew what a meltdown was when I was seven. Because I saw him go, what the fuck? I saw his brain. I come to that conclusion and realtor... I got to shoot this turtle. And just to be clear, it ain't a special turtle. Just to fight. No ninja turtle, just a Danny DeVito looking turtle. The thing you're thinking of. All right. This dude storms off to his bedroom. He takes a couple seconds. Comes back, he's got a fucking handgun. He's got an actual handgun. It's big. Big gun. It's walking straight for the back door. And I stepped in his way. I was like, hey. You can't shoot a turtle. Sentens I never thought I'd have to say in my life. You can't shoot a turtle. This dude goes. You're right. You shoot the turtle. I'm joking. Could you imagine? It's time to be a man. I get this way. I say you can't shoot a turtle. And he goes. I'm going to shoot a turtle. You can't shoot a turtle. And he goes. Now he goes back to his room. Puts his gun away. You understand what I'm saying? The fuck of you done for turtles. I earned my fucking straw. If you don't like it, you can suck my dick. Thank you guys so much, man. Thank you guys.

The only thing I like about cops is the married glasses. This way I could comb my hair so I ran out the ticket, so I wouldn't have that bad. LAUGHTER Ah. I don't see too many faggers, I'm fully, you know? Out in LA, Manhattan, you got them all over the place. Brooklyn, we don't have any gay people. They're all dead. LAUGHTER Well, we got as a big sign. It says, welcome to Brooklyn, fourth largest city in America, with this dead fake hanging off the pole. LAUGHTER They're not from this planet, let's face it. I don't see how any man could look at another guy's hairie-ish and want to bang it, you know? I see a guy with a hairy-ish, I want to give it a wash and blow, right? That's the extent. They're not from this planet, they're from Faggotron, come on. And I always on parade, they march up and down the street with t-shirts and flags. I want money for AIDS disease, beautiful. I want money for new fucking car. I ain't marching up and down the street. Get a job, butt slamer. LAUGHTER CHEERING CHEERING And something else you like running into her she-highway, you know?

That's a nice Sunday surprise. Meet the girl you dreams, you whiny, you dine, you take on, you put your hand up a skirt, y'all, then it treats wrong. What's this, a gift, honey? Bicecuals are my favorite. Thank you, darn it, they must get up in the morning and flip a coin. Yeah, heads I want here by tails, balls across the nose, I mean, I kind of menu as this. I think the biggest joke, I was watching, I was watching the show, 2020, you ever see that joke, 2020? You know what I'm talking about? I'm watching it about a month ago, you know what the big issue was that up in San Francisco, the cockjockey capital, the California, they just passed the bill that smoking is not allowed in the street anymore, it offends people. You can actually be putting jail for it. But it's OK if you want to butt slam your buddy while you're waiting for the bus. Yeah, smack him in the face with your dick five six times. That doesn't offend anybody, right? Yeah, just don't get caught smoking a cigarette doing it. Yeah, you can smoke the baloney pony, but not a windstamp. And then you know what cracks me up all together. When AIDS finally breaks out all over the country, like mildew. You got 20 million packets running around and they're going, where can this come from? How can I get this? How can you get this? It's very simple. Let me explain this. If you're walking around with shit on your dick every day, you're bound to pick something up. You know what I'm saying? This ain't a 24 hour virus. It ain't a migraine headache. Maybe this is God's way of saying a fellas. Like up and smell the toast, OK? I think the best part of being gay is when you're done. You could turn over and talk about football.
Yeah, I started from Brooklyn. I just came from my cousin's house, man. And he lives in the projects, man. We all got cousins who live in the projects, man. We hate going there, don't we? You know, brother lives on the 20th floor. And why is it, when you go to the projects, the intercom never works. It's always broken. You know, like you ring the bell, he comes to the window. Oh, it's it! Yo! Yo! He rang the bell! Yo, come inside! Red, the door's broken! You know, the door's always broken, and it goes inside, and it like roaches crawl all over the place. You know, you ever see a roach in a wall, and the road sees you, so he doesn't move either stands, and like, this, like, uh, he can't see me. I'm gonna stand real still. I'm ninja roach. You know, and the whole family was over there. It was like a big dinner, you know? And then we were sitting down eating, and there was like roaches crawling on the ceiling, and on the walls, and up on everybody. And nobody said nothing. You know, we just kept talking, like, we didn't see the roaches, you know, like, mm-hmm. Yeah, all right, man. It's self-impact. Yeah, man. You know, only person complaining was that cousin from out of town, like, what the fuck? What's going on in here? Ugh! Why isn't anybody saying anything? Why isn't everybody looking at us? Let's see what's happening. Let's go. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Give me the vassaline. Give me the armakicka ass. Armakicka ass.

Let the bitch go. Come here. You don't call a bitch. You know what? Then the titty pops out like... Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! You're not going to be the instigating to fight. She calls you a bitch too. Where'd she go? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! And women, women will always fight other girls, but a girl will never help her boyfriend fight. You ever see a guy getting beat up? His girlfriend's always at the side going, stop it. Stop it! Ah! Ah! Ah! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Stop! Leave me alone! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Stop! Somebody help him! You know he's going to want you help me. I gave my ass me for you. I gave my ass me for you.
Oh, y'all look good. You already have a good time tonight? Hey, nigga, chill your ass out. Ooh, you know, it is like me. Get my cousin. Hi. Sit your ass down now. Hey, how you doing? Hey, what? But you got jungle fever. You got jungle fever. You. How you doing? How did I miss you? How the hell did I miss her? No, get nervous now. Be proud of your shit. She getting red too. You're like, oh fuck. I told you I didn't want to come. I didn't know anything about the deaf jam. God. Oh, he just spoke with family. We're all family. And welcome. No, no, be embarrassed. I know when you all didn't use bad, too. You're like, it, let me. Reservation for you. Oh, shit. No, I'm just saying I don't be nervous. Nah, that's cool. We all, we family. Hi, look at the damn sheep. Why you got your eyes on? You do. You all right? Okay, look good, too. Sorry, pussy just throws me in. I'm sorry. Sorry, pussy just throws me in. Look at this motherfucker. Hey. How you doing? Cooling, you know, cooling hanging in there. Yeah. Hey, whatever, you know. What happened? You could talk to me. I'm your motherfucker. You could talk to me. No, it looks good, though, man. I like y'all, give my man who I noticed him from the back. He said, my uncle's your mom won a round of applause. He's throwing it out. What's up, man? You got a little dog with you? I'm not gonna bring a little dog to his show. What are you gonna laugh at? What are you gonna laugh at? I got a dog with you. What's up? All right, take the spotlight off from spotlight, man. Shit, you embarrassing him. Good, look at the brothers over here. What's up, man? We got gold shitting him up, huh? How much is it called? A lot of motherfucking money. You're not gonna knock your goddamn T-valfas on gold tea, huh? What's that you got? You got like a baby jury, girl. That's real nice. That's this real hip. That's your real hip? I'm fucking amazed. Women like motherfucking good hair. I don't know what that shit is, man. My sister is married to a motherfucking convict. But married him because he had good hair. I told her, what the fuck are you doing? You know what I'm saying? That motherfucking love, man. I said, what the fuck are you doing? Okay, I'm gonna tell you a joke. That motherfucking guy's so good. That's hair. Blood heads on it. We see black people though, right? We're good hair. We always make some goddamn excuse on it. You know what I'm saying? I'm just kidding. Damn, baby, you got some... That's your hair? She said, yeah, that's all I mean. So, damn, that's real, buddy. That's a nice hair. Well, you know, we got Andy and then off our hammer. All right. Oh, no, my mother's hot on her side. The fuck out of here. Yo. You're cute. Very pretty woman. I hate a pretty motherfucking woman. Because they're hard to leave, man. You know what I'm saying? You can't walk out on the motherfuckers, right? You know, you're just like, what? What the fuck is it? And if you can't understand me, fuck it. Please. What are you doing this to me? That shit is hot.
What's going on? Are we all right? What happened? Do I have gizz on my shirt? The guy was really nice. What happened? I got a hair out of place? Yeah, fix my hair. Oh, thank you. That'll do it. Now... You know what that is? That's a real right there. Bang! That's more important than the special. Let's get a nice real comedian. Hair gets done. 300,000 views. Ladies and gentlemen, Joe's with... Thanks. Wow. Thanks. All right. Well, thank you. That's very nice. All right. Thank you. I feel like I got here too quick. I should have let you guys... I shouldn't really let it... It's just stupid when I'm standing here and you're doing it. I'm like... I should have been going on. I'm like weaving through. You're like, wow. It's weird doing a special at a comedy club because I'm getting ready to come up. And I'm just like, right there. You guys can just see me. There's like... Oh, there he is. When you go see Springsteen, you're not like, it's going to rule. All right, there he is. He's got to get in the row. He's in our row right now. He's just like, okay. Oh, here it is. My time. Here we go. Next year we're going to build a thing. I'm going to pop up like a polo cream, you know? And then die. No. This lady's going like this. Don't die. I'll try not to. I would be more upset than you would if I died, you know? All right. Nice to see everybody. I feel like I recognize a lot of people. Thanks for coming. I know you, right? Yeah, we met. This is where I'm at my career right now. After shows, really, really like hot women will come up to me after the show. And they're like, hey, excuse me. Hi. And I'm like, oh, hey. And she's like, my autistic boyfriend loves you. I didn't get it. I thought it was a little dirty and weird, but he loved it. And can he say, huh? And he's just like, I'm like, oh, hey. Thanks. You guys are getting beautiful women somehow. I don't know how you're doing that. You're just like a gay. Anyway, thanks for coming. You guys have this. Is this relatable? You ever think you're like a pretty good looking person? And then you see a photo of yourself, and you think I should kill myself for the good of society. Like you're at home looking in the mirror, and you're like, hey, not bad. And then someone tags a photo of you on Instagram. And you're like, maybe I'll go to the center of town and shoot myself in the face tomorrow. You know, just to let everyone know that I know this is unacceptable. You guys... There's too many photos. That's the problem. I wish that grew up in the 30s with this one photo of you, your whole life. If it sucks, you just burn it, you know? Every day there's like five new photos of me online. They're all, I just want to die. Your friends try to make you feel better. They're always sweet. It's just a bad photo. Don't worry about it. And I'm like, but it's a bad photo because I'm in it, though, right? Like... It's not a blurry photo. It's a 4K HD color photograph of exactly what my face looks like. You're saying it's bad because it's a perfect replica of what I currently look like. It's just me... You're telling me my face is bad. That's what's going on right now. I don't know. I got a friend. He's ugly. We were talking the other day. I feel bad saying that, but he's not here. We were hanging out and I have a hot friend, too. I have a hot friend and an ugly friend. I have many friends, but two friends in this joke. And one's hot and the other one's ugly. And my ugly friend was talking about how we can't get laid. And then we had to pretend it's not because he's ugly. Do you guys ever do that for your friend? He's like, oh, no one's having sex with me. We're like, what? These bitches, man. What the hell? Then he goes to the bathroom and we're like, why does he think someone would have sex with him? That's hilarious. What? It's because he's serious. Then he comes back. My hot friend starts giving him advice. Nobody wants advice from a hot person. No offense if you're hot. I'm looking around. There's a couple of you here, but not many. He says this. He goes, you need more confidence. And I'm like, no, he needs your face. That's why you're confident because you have a good face. He has a bad one. And he says, this is hot people advice. He goes, this is what I do. I just walk up to women in the park, start talking to him. Then my ugly friend gets hope. He's like, I can do that. And then I had to be the one that was like, ah, don't do that. You're going to get maced if you walk up to women in the park. Are you kidding? He can do that because he has a strong jawline and he's tan and his tongue is not visible when he's talking to other people the way yours is. I'm like, you can get laid. I don't know how you're going to get laid. You can do it. Everyone gets laid at some point, I think. I have sex all the time. I'm not a hot guy. You're probably like, well, how do you do? I got married. That's how I did it. That's my advice. People say when you get married, you stop having sex. But I think that's only true if you're like a hot dude that like, you know, smashes, or whatever. If you're like a hot guy that gets laid all the time, don't get married. You'll have sex less. But if you never get laid, get married. You'll have sex more. Like, what's the hardest part of getting laid? You got to convince somebody to come back to your house. You got to be like, come on. My house is fun and safe. That's hard. Women are like, oh, you're like, I swear. Promise. You know, that's like tricky. I don't have to do that. My wife lives in my house. I don't have to do anything. I can just turn a million when I'm sex. And that works. Not every time. I don't want you to think, you know, it works like three out of ten times. That's not bad. I'm a baseball guy. That's all star team, you know. You're gonna have for ten, fifteen years. You're in the Hall of Fame. So... That's pretty good. It's hard to get laid. I feel bad. I was like, when I was single, I didn't get laid much. And I feel bad for women that have sex with men. We're not great. I'm sorry. I would talk to my buddies. I'm like, I ain't gonna get laid. How are you guys doing it? And then my friend would be like, you're too nice. That's due problem. That's the best advice I got was be less nice. That's like the best idea men have come up with to get laid. Like be shittier. Which is more hot people advice, by the way. I'm like, I don't have... I don't think I have the look for that advice. If I'm mean to a woman, she's gonna be like, this is not the guy who sucks. What's up with him? Why does he be like me? Like I'm like, which one of you bitches wants to blow me? Huh? Like they're like, what? But he was right. I was probably too nice. You can be too nice. I would always be like, you're so beautiful. I'll give you money. If you have sex with me. And that's like... That's too nice. You know, that's borderline offensive. I got a buddy. He's like one of these guys. He gets laid all the time. He's like, a good looking guy, whatever. And I was talking to him the other day about sex. And he goes, he goes, if I have sex with a woman, she's got to have perky breasts. That feels unfair, doesn't it? I mean, like having a breast preference is fine, but perky, that's not even a physical adjective. Perky's like a mood. Perky's like, hi, you know? A breast can't be perky. That's like a woman being like, I'll have sex with a guy, but he's gonna have a chipper dick. I really... I want blissful balls on her man, or else... I like a patriotic asshole on my man. You like this? But I have a wife, and we have sex. I think she's attracted to me, you know? How much attracted to her? I think she's hot. I took a photo of her the other day. She looked great. She was all made up, and the sun was hitting her. She looked beautiful. And then I posted on Instagram, and then every comment was like, wow, she's hot. She's out of your league, bro. She's beautiful. How'd you pull that off? And I'm like, you know, you could just say you think she's attractive. You don't have to add that you think I am unattractive. That's not... That's not making me feel great. Also, that's the best photo I have of her. I could post a shittier photo, you know? I got plenty of overhead lighting photos. I could have thrown up there, you know? Those comments would start swinging back in my direction. You guys are pretty evenly matched. I'm like, you're goddamn right, we are. Thank you. People don't just say that, I don't know why. It's like they think it's like charming to be like, you married up out of your league. Ah! They're like, oh, thanks. First of all, it's in hacker. We're in the same league. We're married. That's the same league. We're on the same team. No one ever laughs at that, but I think it's a good point. Like, what's your marriage? You're on the same... And also, you can be on a team with different value. Like Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs back up Hunter. They're in the same league. They don't have the same value. Again, you're not the first crowd to not laugh at this, but it's a good point. And here's a better point. Like, my wife is better looking than me, but I'm like, this motto of league than looks. Like, she's better looking. I'm way more fun. You should hang out with us. I'm like, zinging and zanging and shit. I'm like, dancing and doing karaoke. She's depressed. She sucks. I'm bringing the heat. I bring it in the hang. I got like secret handshakes and nicknames. I'm like, hey, wacky tits. What's that? Wow. I'm always ordering pizza. I'm like, who wants pizza? I'm getting pizza. I'm me. She's like, get one with veggies. I'm like, oh, fine. That's not fun. I'm not saying she's not fun. I'm saying I'm more fun. Like, here's what I go to Starbucks every day and I use the app. And then when you scan the app, it goes, boop. I go like this. I go, ha. That's gold. You guys will laugh at a little. They shit their pants at Starbucks. They're like, what? And I'm like, ah. That's the kind of fun I'm bringing to the hang, you know. I did it the other day though. And this sounds made up, but this really happened. I went, boop. I went, ah. And then the lady went, that happened to somebody earlier. And I was like, who's this asshole doing my bed? That's mine. Are you serious? I'm a fun guy. I swear to God. I used to be more fun. I used to drink. That's when I was like, really fun. You know, drinking is like synonymous with fun. Like, I was like, wild and get after. But I was like, I was like a risky fun. You know what I mean? Like, I do karaoke. I take my shirt off and like throw it in the crowd. But then I go to your house and shit on the floor. I was kind of like, ups and downs, you know, strikes and gutters. You ever get this truck, you ever get like drunk where you're like, you're holding a drink or a cocktail and then you drop it. But nobody like bumped into you or anything like that. You're just kind of like, shhhhh. Hey, I'm not holding that anymore. You're gonna go back to the bar and be like, I got another drink. I just might just committed suicide a couple of seconds ago. It's almost like your hands gave you an intervention. Like, your fingers are like, let's put this down. I don't think he needs this anymore. I've been sober a long time. Every once in a while, I'll get like a message. Someone will reach out to me on Instagram and they're like, how did you know you're an alcoholic? And then I have to write back. Let me help you out. You're an alcoholic. I feel like... I think if you're reaching out to strangers on Instagram to find out about alcoholism, it's probably time to wrap it up, you know. I don't want to be judgmental. I don't drink anymore. I don't do drugs anymore. I was never a big drug guy. I would like smoke weed. But I never liked weed. Are you guys weed people? Some... Oh no, so that's great. Few of you. I never liked it. I would always like freak out. Also, this is my issue with weed. I don't always like smoke in like a circle of like, or strangers. And then you pass around like a joint or a piece or a pipe or a bomb or an apple, whatever. And then it would come to you and you'd be like, all right, the weed. Yeah. I think you pass. You're like, all right, there goes the weed. Fun. But then it comes back like 30 seconds later. You're like, oh, more weed, all right. And then you're like, I'm buzzed. And then it would come back like three, four, five times. But at the end, I'm like, I'm just completely out of my mind. I don't know if you guys... I don't know why we're still doing this. And eventually a guy on the other side of the circle would be like, no, I'm good. And I'm like, I didn't know we could do that. I have no... Nobody told me that was part of this. You're like, rose to parks or some shit. You just like, open up a world of possibility. I'm gonna be sleeping under my bed for the next three days because I had no idea. And I can be like, oh... I'm still fun though. All the ice cream anytime a day. You know what I mean? Like, I don't do drugs or drink, but all the ice cream in the daytime. That's fun. I guess not. I was eating ice cream. I met him with my buddy. I was eating ice cream. And then he was like, why are you eating ice cream? And I was like, I don't know. Fun. And then he was like, I thought we were going to lunch. And I was like, we are. And he's like, why are you eating ice cream now? What are you a child? And I was like, no, I'm an adult. I eat ice cream. Whenever I want to eat ice cream, a child is not allowed to eat ice cream during the day. Sounds like you're a child. You're a little bitch. You're living by... Living by your mother's rules for when you're a seven. When you're gonna have a couple of vegetables, before you're gonna have a scoop, you're a big pussy. I'm fun to watch movies with. You guys should watch a movie with me. I'm like, you probably won't get a chance too, but I'm like... I always have great lines during the... I don't step on the dialogue either. I'm like, in between dialogue, I'll be like, the person next to me is like, you know? That's fun. Here's one of my bests. Like all timers. First time I saw the shiny. You guys saw the shining, right? Classic. Yeah. First time I saw it was in like seventh grade. I watched it with a group of friends. At the very beginning of the movie. They're like driving up into the mountains. Shelley Duval, she says to Jack Nicholson. The air is different up here. And then I went, I fired it. Kill! Everybody was like, oh! Classic list! And I was like... To this day, any time I'm with a group of people, I'm like, you guys want to throw on the shining? Anybody want to watch the shining? Like, this is my son's birthday. He's six years old. I'm like, put it on for five minutes. He'll laugh. Well, turn it off before the naked dead lady comes out. All right? It's gonna be big. You're making me nervous. I saw your elbow each other. What's going on? I saw as my dick out. Oh, it's hot. Oh, it's hot. Oh, I got you. Sorry. It's probably me. It's always awkward. There's like two hot women in the front. Like, I'm like, what? Do they see my boner? Anyways, my wife's... I'm attracted to her. I think she's attracted to me. My wife's four years older than me. That's hot. Don't you think? That's kind of... Yes. Oh, my God. Your wish is my command. The air just came on. That was like... Who else needs something? Anybody? It was like magical. It was like two women. Like, I'm a little hot and just AC just bang. That's what it's like to be a fucking woman in this country. You fucking say something where my ill. What if I did the rest of the show like that? You fucking... Fucking... Ow. I'll smack you around a little bit. I wish I could go back to the beginning of my life and just... Just go full Italian. Oh, fuck, hey. What the hell? Anyways, and cut. My... Guys, I'm not trying to get a special. I'm trying to get reels here. I gotta catch up to these reels, folks. My wife's four years older than me, which I think is like sexy. I think it's like... When I was in eighth grade, my wife was a senior in high school. That's pretty spicy, you know? We didn't know each other then. She's not a criminal or anything. I wish I could go back that time, dude. I'd love to go back to my wife's senior year. I'm in eighth grade, you know? I'd love to walk up to her and her senior prom. I'm like... Covered in pimples and a pearl jam shirt. I just walk up behind her and I'm like, someday I'm gonna see her butthole. And then I just run away. Wouldn't that be... Wouldn't that be fun? She's like, what the hell? Then I'd run back in and I'm like, you won't see my butthole, by the way. It's not a fair... It's not a fair trade-off. I see her. She never sees my. Do you guys have that in your relationships? Yeah. Have you seen his butthole? No. She never sees mine. I see hers and I feel like I should be clear. We have sex and sometimes we have doggy style sex. Sex in the style of dog. And... When you have doggy style sex, I don't know if you know this, but whoever's on the bottom there butthole is sort of exposed. And I don't stare. I don't want you to... I'm not rude. I just kind of like... You know? Just a quick, three Mississippi's at max, you know? I look at it the way you look at your hand and poker. I'm like... I'll check. You know? And it's nice. It's a beautiful... Beautiful hole, you know? But she's never seen mine. I feel bad. I might show her one day. Like maybe it's something you're on her birthday, you know? I'll wake up early and be like, honey, check it out. Look at this. That's all I got you this year. I don't think she'd like it though. I feel like... I've never looked at my butthole, but when I walk around it doesn't feel like it looks good, you know? Like it feels dry and wet, you know? I lost a lot of you on that one and that's fair. I'll move off the butthole stuff, but... Isn't there where that A hole and B hole mean the same hole? Isn't that funny? Two different letters, same hole. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, yeah. I'm not a mad scientist. Anyways, we have sex and... It's fun. We've been together a long time though. You were trying to like, I don't know how long... My wife and I have been together for like 11 years. You were trying to like come up with ways to like spice things up a little bit. And then in the middle of that conversation you realize maybe we're not sexually compatible. Have you guys ever had that? No, well that's the premise of the joke, so... I was like, let's mix it up. I have like a piece of paper. I wrote down a bucket list of sex stuff from like, let's get weird, you know? She had no piece of paper, so right away I was like, this isn't gonna be great. I can feel it. And I was like, I had my paper, I'm like, what do you got? And then she was like, what if we have sex quietly and pretend there's someone in the other room? And then I just started wrinkling up my piece of paper. I was like, you know what? I don't think we're ready for mine just yet. Quiet sex, that's what you came up with. I don't know if you think that's a porn category, is it? First of all, we live in New York City. There is someone in the other room. There's like seven people, like 40 feet from us that can hear us. Not on my fantasies are quiet. Mine are noisy and there's a bunch of people involved. She's related to a handful of them. She's like, what's one of you? I couldn't even do mine. I had to improvise. I was like, what about missionary with jazz playing? She was like, ooh, I like that. I'm like, yeah, I'm sick. And she found my paper. She's like, what's entire basketball team? I'm like, give me that fucking thing. That was some other shit I was thinking about. I don't know. We were hanging out talking the other day, me and some friends. Adult friends, my wife and I, and some friends. Adult conversation, talking sex. And then in the middle of conversation my wife was like, what's the average penis? Like eight inches? I was like, I'm sorry, who were you fucking before me? What? Eight inches? And she was like, well, how big is your penis? I think she thought I had an eight inch penis. She's never measured something. I don't know. I just thought I had an eight inch penis. And then I had to tell her, I was like, I have half of an eight inch penis. I would need a second dick to get to eight inches. I'm not going to think I'm like, do women not know the average penis sex? Because if not, we should like crack into WebMD or something like that. You know, like, put down 2.5 or whatever. That way if they look it up, you can be like, yeah, there's a pretty, I'm like, almost double that. I like dirty talk. Dirty talk is good in a relationship. That way, especially in a relationship, dirty talk is good because like, you have a sense for the other person, you know, like they know what they might like to hear. It's hard when you're single dirty talk. Because when you're single and you're dirty talk, that's just like guessing. You might offend. What's all right sex with the woman when I was single? This is her dirty talk. In the middle of it, she went, she goes, if you don't come, I'm going to be pissed. That sounds hot, but she didn't know me, you know, like, I think she thought I was going to be like, well, get ready to be happy. I'm like, I can't work under these conditions. I'm a nervous nilly. And at the time I was on Paxle for anxiety and depression. That's like a major side of it. I'm like, I can't come at all. It takes me like a week to masturbate. You can shove a shoe in my butt. I'm not coming on this stuff. I want support of dirty talk. I want like, if you come, that's great. If not, no big deal. You're worthy of love, just for being you, you know. You're dad loves you. He doesn't have to show it. That would be nice. I'd be like, oh my god. Yes. I'm self-conscious about my life. I got called ugly in high school, by the way. That's like a lot of this, I comes from when I was in high school, I got called ugly, like publicly. And it really, you know, in high school, something happens like lingers, you know? Yeah. I was at a girls basketball game. And I know, we had a great girls basketball team. This is the 90s, by the way. It was called girls basketball in the 90s. Now it's called women's basketball, we've progressed. In the 80s, it was called cons basketball. Every decade, we get better, you know? Eventually, it'll just be basketball. But for now, progress is slow. But I would go to all the games. We had a great team. I was like, I'm like a school spirit guy. I'm a big sports guy. And I would go to all the games. I would paint my face and shit. I wasn't a cheerleader, but I would leave the cheer. I would get the chance going. I was like, let's go Panther. I was like that guy. You know? I feel like a lot of what you would have hated me. I'm getting a vibe here. I had a great time. The team loved me. But at one game, I was getting the chance going. And then this girl from the other school, she started chanting, you are ugly. Yes. Very hurtful. Thank you. This is 1998. You could totally do that. If you did that now, then arrest you or shoot you or whatever. But back then, they were like, nice. Got him. Yeah. But I tried to get a counter-chan. I was like, screw this, I was like, come on guys. I'm like, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. No he isn't. I'm trying to get a no he isn't chant going. But my school went rogue. They didn't want a chant. No he isn't. They went with so are you. Which they nailed her. I don't know if you're following like they nailed her, but they included me in the chant. Like this woman called me ugly and then everybody I'd ever met in my entire life in Unicent was like totally he is ugly absolutely but also you are I had to join that chant I was like yeah Both ugly I felt like family feud I'm like okay good answer yeah That was the number one answer And then I was like what about no he is in I was like Nobody said that I thought like six or seven people would have said no here they're like no nobody Whatever I saw the girl after the game and I was like hey maybe we should Look up, you know, we both just found out we're ugly. Why don't we? Let's go fuck, you know, I thought that would be She didn't go for it whatever This is distracting should I move this? I don't like it this close because I want to grab it when it's here Guys you're gonna shit get ready for this one This is my impression of a British race car driver you ready Because it's over here you see Oh Clip it That's gonna be huge That's one of those jokes that's really stupid but I'm like maybe that should be in the special that's kind of funny. I don't know This is another one like that I think it's hilarious I was watching that you guys saw the Batman movie Doesn't matter. It's not great But at one point Batman gets a cell phone call and he answers his phone, but I thought he should have been like this. Hello Yeah, it's crazy Because his ears are up here That's gold guys. I don't know what to tell you But Anyways my wife and I we have sex and it's pretty cool Cuz I'm fun only a fun person comes up with that Batman gang I think she likes me, you know We're hanging out the other I don't know I get nervous. I have a lot of anxiety I think it's a turn off. I don't I think you guys did you guys We're in Greenwich Village right now. Did you guys get a constant outside at all this some? Do you did oh great nice? That was so genuine You're like yeah, as a matter of fact we did It's crazy out there right? I'm scared. I'm like I got like fears now I've had a couple run-ins some of you guys know the stories I've had a couple run-ins with very aggressive homeless people this year One in was in Austin two guys came up to me they got right in my face And they were like screaming at me and then there was like a third guy at a buy I just took off run. I'm a runner I have no I read people ask me for directions in the city. I take off running. I don't give a shit Then I came back to New York right around the corner from here. I had a guy like do that shit. I was like oh like I'm like I don't know what it is. I was telling my buddy and then he was like that he goes well. What are you saying to these guys? I was like I think what you're doing is called victim blaming. I believe I just learned this term I think I'm using it correctly What am I saying? Do you think I'm talking shit to homeless people? Is that Is that the vibe I'm putting out? I don't know I said I got 50 bucks fight me for it bitch. Should I not have done that? Is that Was that a mistake? Cause I wanted to help them out but I don't want to give them a free ride so I Threatened to fist fight them for cash I'm like I didn't say anything And then you feel like self-cultured stuff because I've run a few times this year and I was talking to my buddy And I was like am I like a guy? I feel like I'm pussy am I a coward for running And then my friend was like no you did the right thing and I was like thank you And he goes yeah because if you hit one of those guys they fall on the ground crack the head open you can go to jail And I was like yeah That's why I ran I would have killed those sons of bitches You get me These hands are goddamn weapons As I was running with tears in my eyes I was like don't make me beat the shit out of you guys Everybody's got an opinion I was telling my other buddy about it. I got a couple instances You know and he goes this way I need a gun. I've been telling you you got to get a gun I'm not yet tired god. I'm whatever you guys are I want to you guys I agree with everybody but I Just feel like I could be wrong. I don't think my life would be going better right now If I had shot and killed three homeless people this year. I don't know There's no way to know which way your life would have gone. I just feel like People like how you been pretty good traveling doing a lot of shows visit my mother. Oh, I shot three guys in the face They were They were addicted to drugs nobody was helping them. They got kind of close to me. So I blew their brains out There's a lot of paperwork, but it's cool, you know It felt good I'm really I'm not I'm not whatever gun whatever. I'm just not I don't think I have gun personality That's the problem. I just don't picture myself. You're like wow Do you still blow out your gun? I don't know if that happens anymore. I used when I was a kid you I think we find you to shoot and then be like this instead Again, not killer, but fun. That's a fun Let me ask you guys. I don't know there's probably not a lot of gun owners. We're in Greenwich Village right now But maybe some of you have guns does loading a gun feel anything like putting your air pods back into the case because I feel like I think I might be a gun guy. I never realized it like You know, that was putting my air pods. It kind of sucks them in. It's like Then you snap a shot. I'm like oh shit my dick just move. Maybe I did a gun, you know Air pods are fun. They're versatile. Look at that. I came home and I had my air pods in and my wife was like How was your day? And I kind of was like that. I was like pretty good. Cindy was being a bit. I like to pretend They're earrings just kind of like Just for a moment, you know, I like to I Was here in New York and I was going I had air pods and listening to some music and I was crossing the street And then the lights started to change so I kind of like jogged and then I don't know the physics behind this But one of my air pods fell out of my ear and it bound and somehow it bounced like straight up And then I just caught it like in stride. I was running and I was like whoa and I caught it and then the guy in his car went It's the best I've ever felt in my entire life like literally I think I peaked And I've lived a full life. I mean, I've been on the tonight show and I've gone to South America And I went down on a woman once. I mean, I've really I've lived But this just felt like whoa I But I went home and told my wife I was like my air pod bounced and I caught it And she was like wow, and I was like you don't get me like he does When will you see me? I didn't know air pods bounce now I want to like learn how to do it like be it a party and be like What Thank you this guy tried to get into applause break on that joke, so I appreciate you. God bless you Now it's now there you go with my help. Oh, thanks That's very That was the least genuine in the plaza of all time in the history of comedy just The air pod thing I Was a very begrudging applause break. All right, I guess how hard is it to catch an air pod? But I'm fine. I think I'm fun. I think I'm funny. I think all these jokes are great some of you are sitting them out, but whatever I think I'm funny Sometimes you try to be funny and then the people don't take its funny. I was hanging out my wife one lady's dying back there and Can we get a mic on that lady please? Junge this up a little I'll say on my wife and my mother-in-law the other day the three of us were hanging out You know, and then my wife was we're just kind of talking my wife went sometimes when I run I peel a little And then her mother was like I think that's normal as you get older and then I leaned in and I was like I think it's probably my fault and I gave away I thought that was pretty good A little I'm destroying your daughter's pussy material. I thought that was I thought that was damn funny right off the top my head She didn't love it. She was not Into it, but I thought I was telling my buddy and he goes she probably didn't laugh because it's two different holes I was like first of all you just blew my mind Second of all I don't think that's why she didn't laugh. I don't think I don't think she was like wait I I thought I had this I thought this was funny and I was hanging out I have a niece and she's 10 years old and then we were hanging out and She had they have they have a family dog and the dog's name is Penny and she said she went come here Penny And then she turned to me and she said I'm trying to teach the dog to come Yeah, you guys are laughing already That's funny I thought it was funny also Because come Which by the way, she's a child I want you to know I wasn't like Sick oh, you know, I just I kept a straight face But I wanted to be like choking a little and be patient, you know, I had that locked and loaded Because I'm fun But I didn't say it I got to wait like 10 years to be like one time you said you wanted to teach the dog to come Even that won't be funny though because she'd be like you've been thinking about this for 10 years You creep I told her mother though. I thought this is where I went right. I told her mother I was like Brooks said she wanted to teach the dog to come And then her mother was like why are you saying that to me? What? And I was like well, it's funny come She was like what is wrong with you and I was like well I Didn't the dog didn't come I don't know why you like can't you remove yourself from the situation and see that that's Anyways, I'm not allowed to see my niece anymore, but we had a good run. We had a fun 10 years together. That's a good length of time for a relationship I think Whatever I think I'm funny and um I think I'm a smack got you I think I'm gonna be a pilot you guys ever think that you're gonna Are you a pilot oh? Okay, do you think you think you could be pilot too? I think I could do it You ever get on a commercial plane. You're like I could fly this goddamn plane Me and you buddy you got pilot head you gotta like you look like a pilot You're well-coffed you know I don't think it's that hard are there any pilots here? Yeah, fuck pilots. I think it's um I think it's a bullshit job. I don't think we need all this reverence What is it you do this this thing you push the this is like the takeoff Here we go There's like a couple clicks couple switches up here And if you get the wrong one there's another guy. He's like no, no, it's these two over here You got a buddy up there How easy is that I don't get a buddy. It's just me up here. I've done a couple of jokes. It didn't go great I can't be like Pete You got a friend helping out and then you lay and that's just You pull it back Click those down you scoop off the head shit That's easy. I drive a car. That's way harder. That's feet and hands and texting. It's very difficult. That's a lot Plus this auto pilot too. Did you guys I always heard about that like computers fly the plane Which I always thought was like oh okay, whatever and then like I started I fly like I started getting upgraded when you fly first class You learned did you know this the pilot leaves the cockpit? I Had no idea I got the pilot the whole flight was like They're not it's not even stressful They're like walking around they like grab chips and slap flight attendants on the acid shit. They're like They're not even in there Like nobody gives a shit about a bus drive like if you tell people you're a bus driver And no one's like what whoa? But a bus driver can't get up and walk around Like if you're in a greyhound reading and the bus driver's like what are you reading what's going on? But you're like I Don't really think it's that easy. I don't think I'd be a pilot but I do say I do what bothers me is they do like a meet and greet that's what they feel very Full of themselves like we land and the pilot just at the front of the plane like That was me We're not gonna walk by one of the time like nice dude. I was gonna be like fuck you. I could have done that you suck Nice tie your dork, you know So Sometimes they'll make jokes you ever have that we ever like a pilot like come on and like crack jokes That's what real as a comedian that really Offends me Everyone's wrong you're gonna to play in the pilots like we might have a few bumps just like one of my wife drives And the whole plane's like oh I'm like yeah, I heard of me sucks. It's not funny I'm like you're just laughing because he has your life in his hands. That's why you think it's funny If I could just kill all of you guys at any moment you guys to be losing your shit at every joke I do one of these bits at bombs. I'm like all right here we go. I'm like no I was on a flight the other guy next to me got up and went and used the bathroom in the middle of the flight And then he came back and when he comes back he sits down. He goes they got a window in the bathroom on this plane I was like nice And he goes you can't open it though I'm like I feel like I just learned two things about this fella. He's He's a fucking idiot and he just took a huge shit. Those are my hypotheses Pretty sure that guy shit of the plane then he was like oh they gonna win. Oh no you can't open I gotta let my buddy know I gotta So thanks for the heads up. I was gonna try to kick the windows out at 35,000 feet But now that I know I'm always traveling and every every weekend I'm like traveling I'm on Check into a hotel. I'm always order a pizza every time I get to a hotel I order a pizza you guys know me. I'm like I like to order a pizza, you know But some hotels it's very frustrating like I don't know how often you guys order pizza in hotels But I do it like every week and some hotels if it's like a shitty hotel They just let the delivery guy he'll like get in the elevator. He comes right up to your floor He'll just like knock right on your door. Yeah, it's very nice You know, it's a put pants on you can just be like oh thanks dude. All right But it's like nicer hotels. They don't want the delivery guy in the elevator So you got to come down to the lobby to meet them which is very annoying you're shaking. Yeah, it's very annoying Right here's the most annoying part not that you have to leave your room It's that I don't know if you ever got on a hotel elevator with a fresh pizza But what happens is somebody else gets on the elevator with you and then they say hey I hope you're all enough for everybody Are we teaching that in community college? I don't understand Literally everybody said I got everybody and I never understand the rea am I supposed to be like What Like is this supposed to be hilarious Are by supposed to be like we didn't I didn't bring enough for everybody I go with it.

I was like you don't touch paintings Then he goes why and that's when I realized I'm only a little bit smarter than him I was like I actually don't know why Um It is dry The guy that painted it's dead and I was like you know what fuck maybe I'm wrong maybe you can touch paintings I'm in India and I just started touching it Touches paintings by the way that's a fun term for your friend who's kind of a dumb dumb, you know Like I grew up in the 90s and we used the word retarded a lot That was a big Word yeah, that's no good now.

the fact that you have let our commander in chief a niggle run this goddamn country we appreciate that you didn't kill him you left the niggas short to work with thank you very much white people

I'm here bye 10 minutes Let me let me let me just let me just take this time to say that Okay, look just cut this real quick. Talk to tell y'all something Cut. Okay No no bullshit. I don't know each of y'all personally, but I always feel a little more comfortable when I'm up here and the people is out here because at the end of the day I really was never tall even when I started. I never was really special to fucking look at but when I came to LA, Niggas acted like they understood where the fuck I was coming from and allowed the nigga to be that. So when I retired, there was a lot of things going on and I didn't want to come back and tell y'all what the fuck it was because I wanted y'all to be proud of me for some shit even if I was fucking it up but then they started to rest at a nigga so much. Understand you can only get arrested maybe six times before it ain't fun no more. I just want you to understand that if you go to TMZ you will see the fact that I've been arrested 14 times and 46 months. What I want you to understand is you have never ever in your life seen me standing in a courthouse. Now put them to TMZ together. Same name shit, everything he tried to do he loses at because he ain't shit. His people ain't shit. Nothing he likes and shit. All his people is ugly. They all stack. They was worse off. We'll fool the recession during the recession after the recession. He ain't shit and so I understand that even if they was gonna kill me for the shit I got to say I don't know why I'm still here in the first motherfucking place. What I do know is I've been waiting my whole life for 2012. I've been waiting my whole life to think that the end of the goddamn world was finna come. So now niggas let's say it don't come. Can we agree to at least act like this gonna be our last time on this motherfuckers so we can do it right. One goddamn time. What I'm telling you is bitch niggas is done. I know what you've been saying I know what you've been looking at. I know you think Tyler Perry must have 46 more gross dressing drag queen movies left in him. I'm not homiful. I am nothing against gay women at all. Power to the lesbian nation. Then we all eat pussy this evening if it's feasible. But it's time for people to stand up for what the fuck they are. Everybody can't be ashamed to tell the goddamn truth. It can't be everybody that won't say what the fuck they meant to say as soon as they get the opportunity. Christian people it's the same for y'all. If y'all so holy it's time to get motherfucking holy. If you believe in some shit make sure you got some right shit because I'm trying to tell you everybody can't be right. I say fuck bitch up at it long and everybody who ever went to his goddamn church is what I say. Fuck the choir, the choir director, the people in the choir, the niggas on drums, fuck them in the parking lot. Not because I'm homophobic but I don't think you can preach the gospel with booty on your breath. I just don't think you can. I'm not saying you can't. I don't think you can. It's not my fault. When I was eight years old they told me a bunch of stories that didn't make no sense. They put me down and sat me right in front of the Bible and told me a story about Sodom and Gomorrah. They told me it was two cities in the Bible where men lay with men. Then they said the next day God burnt the whole goddamn two cities to the ground and up to goddamn start. Now I don't know what you get out of that story. I told my brother I don't know if you are three. They just said we're going to burn down our bunk beds if you get in this goddamn bed. Just what the fuck they told me. I just didn't know. Hey, some of you niggas watching right? Is it two or is it one? Let me know. It's two. Let me ask the white people. What white people? What time is it, please? It's time. I put it on. God damn it. Let's see it. Hey, where are my people at? Ladies and gentlemen, no matter what, we are here at the cost of 2012. God damn it. There's been a come. Hey, where are my people at? Okay, hold on. Yeah, it's really good to see the people who a shot was not given to me. I'm on a grand show. My hope is that there is somebody that's
The second time I met O.J. Simpson. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. O.J. Simpson was the most famous or infamous face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn't alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents and celebrating a deal that they told them was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white, and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Our Collins couldn't believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was O.J. Simpson. newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn't mean to say that loud, but it just came out. O.J. You stopped. Turn around and see who said it. Saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with. And shook my hand. How are you, young man? He looked in my eyes and I could see in his eyes that he didn't remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back in my agents and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice the disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. How could you, as she said? How could you shake hands with that murderer? I said, Jim, but I'll do respect it. That murderer ran for over 11,000 years. Now I could be bitter and blame all the police, but now I'll tell you who I blame. I'm still fucking sketch artist. They keep drawing the same brother over and over again. Who is this generic man we all look like? I want to know what they say when it's us. You know, I'm really being that room like, did you get a look? Do you see the guy that tried to rob you? Yes. Yes, I did. He was about six feet tall, I'd say. Six feet tall? Yes. He had his head on backwards too. Good. That's good stuff, huh? He was on backwards. Yes. He was black. Okay, big lips, big nose, dick hanging out. Say no more, sir. Now, draw him from memory. You know, let me get my stencil, I think we can trace this guy and save some time. The only thing I society that bothers me the most is the way that men and women don't get along the wall. That's really what's bugging me about it. Men and women just don't get along. Like I hear women say this all the time. I know a lot of you say, it's like, shivery is dead. Don't you? Don't you feel that way? Like men aren't gentlemen anymore? That's right. Shivery is dead and women killed it. As a fundamental difference in the way we're going to see things, we're not going to see out of Owens issue. We're just not. Our test in life are different. A woman's test in life is material. A man's test in life is a woman. Now, by test I mean that those are the things that we desire. Men have nice cars. Not because they like nice cars because they know women like nice cars. That's how it goes. Because men are hunters and the cars debate. And a woman comes and says, ooh, nice Porsche. Gotcha bitch. That's how it is. That's true. Come on there. You go to a woman's house. Her house would be comfortable as shit. Women love comfortable surroundings. So they can get comfortable surroundings. Let me tell you something. If a man can fuck a woman in a cardboard box, he wouldn't buy a house. But that's still not where shivery got killed. Shivery got killed by the feminist movement on the magazines that got women going crazy. Because women got too much advice about men from other women. And they don't know what the fuck they talk about. It's true. I see the shit in the magazines. I don't read them but I've been seeing the cover. I've been a grocery store fellow. He looked at one of the magazines. I was like, what is this? I was saying a cover. 100 Ways to Please Your Man by Some Lady. Yeah. You know, 100 Ways. This is four things. No, I'm just psychotic. Play with his balls and fix him a sandwich. And don't talk so much. And then the magazines trick the women. The magazines stop picking at your self-esteem. Every page you turn, you start feeling fatter and uglier. And you feel like your clothes aren't good enough. And the magazines have you forgotten how fucking beautiful you are. And that's what happens. Now look what happens. And then you forget how beautiful you are and we all suffer. If pussy was a stock, it would be plummeting right now. Because you flooded the market with it. You're giving it away too easy. I'm just being truthful. I'm just talking. It would plummet. Maybe watching this today pussy plummet again. But I'm a stock. Gold is up 10 points. You can see it. You ever have this happen. This is how confusing it is. This is the practical application when I'm talking about. Like a guy be out. This happens to get out guys. You be out of club. Bar right. He's kicking with your boys. And a girl walks by. And a man she looks good. She looks good. And that's not good in that classical way. I'm talking good. She got half her ass hanging out her skirt. Her titties are all mashed together. Popping out the top of her turtle neck and shit. And he was your buddies, right? You were your buddies. You got a couple of drinks in here. And you see, guys, you might try to talk to it. You might not come out right now. I don't know what you say. Damn, I'm looking at titties. The girl gets mad. Oh, oh, oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just because I'm dressed this way does not make me a whole. Which is true. Gentlemen, that is true just because they dress a certain way. It doesn't mean they are a certain way. Don't ever forget it. But ladies, you must understand that that is fucking confusing. Just the ends. That would be like me. They should pay out a comedian walking around the streets and a cop being a fool. Somebody might run up on me. Oh, thank God. Officer, help us. Come on over here. Help us. I'm not going to let all of them out. Get all. Get because I'm dressed this way does not make me a police officer. You know what I'm saying? I was like, all right, lady, fine. Fine. You are not a whore. But you are. We're in a whore's uniform. I'll tell you that's the way. You're going to miss understanding. Understanding is going to happen. And then, man, we miss understanding women a lot. You know, we always undermine their feelings. You can't do that to them. You can't. Because, see, feelings, this year they clap and feelings are very important to women. They are all important. I'm just learning this shit. Everything is based on how they feel. You can hear when they tell stories. You know, here, man, tell a story. It'll be just facts. Who what? When, where, why? It was me and Bob. We was at Safeway. And then, a nigga, Bob said this. And I pushed that nigga and then I broke out. That's the story. That's the story. Women, tell stories. All these feelings. The first boy he was understanding. I was on my period and I just talked to my mother. So I was feeling like we were like, God, fam, it was too many feelings. The fuck happened? You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. But I gotta talk about it. I gotta talk about it. And that's how they always get me. I've been sitting there watching TV chilling and shit. My old lady come up to me. David, we need to talk. Fuck! I don't say that out loud. That's how I feel inside. Because I know every time we need to talk, we need to talk about some shit that I gotta do. We don't have to talk about anything she needs to do. She leaves me defenseless. I have to do what I have to do. David, we need to talk. Nah. Don't do that to me, David. This is serious. Stop talking in that voice. Now say. I gotta do what I say. Say. Say. You got damn sick of it. This is the worst time ever being a celebrity. You're gonna be finished. Everyone's doomed. Michael Jackson has been dead for 10 years. And this nigga has two new cases. And if you haven't watched that documentary, then I'm begging you. Don't watch it. It's fucking gross. I felt like HBO was sticking baby dicks in my ears before I was straight. Really nasty shit. I wanna know all these things. Turns out Michael Jackson allegedly likes a long gander at the anus. So they say he stays with people's buttholes. That's what they said. That's how gross the documentary was. I'm gonna say something that I'm not allowed to say. But I gotta be real. I don't believe these motherfuckers. I do not believe. But let me qualify the statement. I am what's known on the streets as a victim blamer. You know what I mean? If somebody comes up to me like, Dave, Dave, Chris Brown just beat up Rihanna. I'll be like, well, what does she do? Dave, Michael Jackson was molest the children. Well, what were those kids wearing at the time? I don't think you did it. We know what? Even if you did do it, you know what I mean? I mean, it's Michael Jackson. I know more than half the people in this room have been molested in their lives. But it wasn't no goddamn Michael Jackson. It's just he ain't got his dick sucked by the Kangapak. All we get is awkward thanks-givings for the rest of our lives. You know how good it must have felt to go to school the next day after that shit? Hey, Billy, how was the weekend? How was my weekend? Michael Jackson sucks my dick. And that was my first sexual experience. If I'm starting here, then, oh, sky's the limit. I know it seems harsh, but man, somebody's got to teach these kids. There's no such thing as a free trip to Hawaii. Yeah, he's going to want to look at your butthole or something. You know what I don't believe it? You know I don't believe it? Because Michael Jackson's out here doing all this molesting. Then why not McCulloch Hawkins? McCulloch Hawkins stayed in an interview that Michael Jackson never did anything inappropriate with him or even around him. Think about that shit. You know, I'm not a pedophile. But if I was, McCulloch Hawkins the first kid, I'm fucking, I'll tell you that right now. I'll be a goddamn hero. Hey, hey, hey, hey over there. Fuck the kid from home alone. And you know how hard he is to catch. All our stars, man. Our Kelly pissed on his victim. I know it was rough. But I mean, again, I can't even judge our Kelly. First of all, we don't know if these allegations are true. And that even they are true. If you want to know how I feel about it honestly, if a man cannot pee on his fans, I don't want to be in show business anymore. Because that's why I got in the game. Baby, I got dreams too. You guys are confused in the issue. Why you guys are busy worrying about if our Kelly even peed on this girl or not? You're not asking yourself the real question. That America needs to decide once and for all. And that question is, how old is 15 really? Oh, that's a good question. That's a good question. I'm not saying that a person is as smart as they're going to be at 15. That's not what I'm saying, man. But I am saying 15 to me is old enough to decide whether or not you want to be pissed on. I mean, that's me. If you can't make a decision like that by the time you're 15, then just give up motherfucker because life is way harder than that. I make tougher decisions all the time. If you don't want to get pissed, I want to just get the fuck out of the way. It's not even a decision. If I start peeing on the front row, they're not going to have to calculate and think, how do I feel about this? Am I okay with it? They just move. You can do that at 15. I could have. I bet 15. When I was 15, I was doing stand-up in night clubs. I smoked a rafel from time. I was trying to hang a fuck. I knew what was happening around me to some degree. Getting pissed on was the least of my worries at 15. Trust me. But it keeps coming up. There's a lot of confusion around that age. Any time 15 comes up, people freak out. Like when that girl Elizabeth Smart got kidnapped. Right? Remember when you told last year's 15-year-old girl Elizabeth Smart was kidnapped? And then they finally found her and the whole country was relieved. And I was the only one saying, damn, she wasn't that smart after all. Not because she got kidnapped. That could happen to anybody. I'm not knocking her for that. I'm just saying, if you're kidnapped me when I was 15, you got to take me further than eight miles away from my house. Man, God damn. Can't hold me prison around. Shit, I recognize. I'll break away. I'll break away. Fuck off me. That's my bus stop. I know I'm going home. I'm going home. She was missing for six months, eight miles away from my house. That's two exits, man. That's nothing. And while she was missing during this half a year that this girl was missing, this is a seven-year-old black girl gets kidnapped and fill a delphia. Nobody knows her name. They might have talked about a two or three times on the news, but she should have been the top store. Because she chewed through the ropes and had both of these motherfuckers in jail. And 45 minutes flat. Seven years old. I'm not making this up. There's two crack heads kidnapped and took them back to the crack house and tied her up. And then they left her. There's a crack heads. I got to make moves, crack smoke, chocolate, eat. These motherfuckers made moves. It was out. But as soon as they left, this little girl got the nibbun. She was kidnapped at four o'clock. And at home, watching herself on news at 5.30. That shit is crazy. That's a news store. That is a news store. Now, meanwhile in Utah, 15-year-old Elizabeth's smarts captors left her alone too. And they didn't even tie her up because they're here at Bill East. They just bounced. Don't try to escape, bitch, or will kill you. Be right back. They're leaving. And she's 15 sitting in the house by herself. How am I going to get out of this? Come on, Elizabeth, think. Think Elizabeth, how am I going to get out of here? Why don't you just open the fucking door and go outside? Have you thought about that? Do you have a quarter? Do you know your phone number? Your 15-inch run? Stop thinking and stop making moves. I know I sound mean. And I know what the people are thinking when I'm saying this day, she's only 15. All right. But that's the discrepancy because when you talk about a little girl like Elizabeth's smart, then the country feels like 15 is so young and so innocent. On the flip side, here comes 15 again. Now we talk about a 15-year-old black kid in Florida. This black kid accidentally killed his neighbor when he's practicing wrestling moves that he saw on TV. Now, was he a kid? Oh. They gave him light. They always try our 15-year-olds as adults. The sneaker, nobody was doing. So God damn pile driver. This kid gets on the ropes, there's no stopping him. You'd have to send a rock to a restaurant. And they gave a 15-year-old boy life and jail. If you think that it's okay to give him life and jail, then it should be legal to pee on him. That's all I'm saying. You got to make up your mind across the board. How old 15 actually is? That's all I'm saying. So I'm going to tell you right now, if somebody comes in here and puts a gun in my head and says, Shepale, you got a choice to make. You're either going to jail for a month or we'll let you go. But you got to let R. Kelly pee on you. I'm not hesitating. Bringing R. Kelly and telling him to stay away from my ass. I'd rather get pissed on on the outside and fucking the butt on the insides. I can't go to jail with some smooth Botox balls and think everything's going to be alright. It's not that kind of place. Taking my chance with that pissed-a-wash-off with a 10-minute shower, I'm certain of it. This piss is coming right out. What can I do? They're going to put me in jail. Too much pressure. That's my problem. I can't handle pressure. Sometimes pressure makes me talk different. I'm serious. You ever have that social pressure? You ever talk to somebody who's fake and they make you fake? Like, that kind of thing. Hey, how you doing? You're like fine, are you? I don't even talk like that. I get sick of that shit. That makes me sick. Sometimes I talk crazy just to make myself feel better. You know, do that. It's not talking like crazy. I never heard his voice. That's how bad guys use to talk in the 40s. In the old days, say, I talk like that. Now all the time, if somebody put depression on me, I got to cut loose. Maybe the police pulled me over. I talk crazy. Son, son. Do you know why we hold you over? Nah, because I'm black, see? That's right. Bang! I do it. It's not illegal to talk like that. How they know I don't talk like that every day. Stop talking like that. Stop talking like white cover. Hey. Try to talk, see? You got to make life interesting like that, because the shit is flimsy. Life is flimsy. You think you're going to live forever? It's dangerous out here. We know what's going on. I travel now. You know, I just think DC had the roughest ghettos in the country. Nah, they go, oh. I have seen some shit now. Oh, there's some rough, rough areas outside of DC. Yeah, everybody should go to the ghetto. I was taken to the ghetto one time. That's the worst. When you get taken to the United, expecting to go? Usually you want to know when you're going to get it. Like, I'm going to see some loud shit. I'm going to see some crazy. When you're taken, it's different. I had a limousine driver. It was after a show, it was late at night. It was like three in the morning. I had a limousine driver. He was a nice guy. I'd talk to him and shit, oh, hey, where are you from, dawg? DC? Where? That's a rough city, man. And his cell phone started ringing. Hold on a second. Hello? Oh, something, nigga. What? What the fuck? Slow down. No. No. No. Fuck that. Nigga, fuck it. I'm on my way. Woo. I gotta make a stop real quick. At three o'clock in the morning, I didn't know he was taking me to get it with first. That's how I look at the winner. I was like, what the fuck? Gunstore? Gunstore? Gunstore? Gunstore? Gunstore? Gunstore? It's not look good. He didn't say shit. Just pulled up in front of my old, Ricky building. That looked like a project. Now, I'd never been there before. I'm not sure if it was a project, but it certainly had all the familiar symptoms of a project. Fucking crackhead ran this way. And then another one jumped out of tree and shit. And then I said, I'll be right back. And left me. Took the keys with me. Just left me. At three o'clock in the morning, in front of a project, in a fucking limousine. This was not good. I was like, man, I gotta look around and see if I can see some landmarks. And figure out where I'm at. I have to escape on foot. Now, this is when I knew I was in a bad neighborhood. You only see this in the worst neighborhoods. Remember, it's three o'clock in the morning. It's three o'clock in the morning. I look out the window. It was a fucking baby standing on a corner. It was. And the baby, the baby didn't even look scared. He was just standing there. I mean, it made me sad. It made me sad, really. I mean, because I wanted to help the baby. Well, I don't trust you either. I'm sorry. Quick. The old baby on the corner, trick, eh? You're not gonna fall for that shit. Where is this limousine, drive me? You know, I stop feeling bad. It's time goes by, I stop feeling worse. I said, man, what is wrong with me? What the hell is wrong? I'm scared of a baby. This baby could be in trouble. He might need my help. I gotta do something. But I wasn't going to get out the car. I'm serious, man. I was packed and went in there a little bit. It was the old limousine. I could roll it down. Hey, baby. Baby, go home. Man, it's three o'clock in the morning. What the fuck are you doing up? The baby said, I'm seven weeks, and they gots at home. I want to respect it in. I'm sorry I had to buy two bags from the car. I don't get to, I don't get to. I'm gonna get to the car. I got back in the car and rolled me a joint, man. That shit was scary, man. Every once in a while, like a crackhead will come up to the car and looking to win, it was like Jurassic Park and should he be looking on the car? Get out of here, crackhead. That baby was still standing there, man. That's not feeling bad again. Yeah, we make it feel guilty sometimes. What is wrong with me, man? I have just bought weed from an infant. I can't condone this kind of behavior. What am I thinking? I can't let the fear ruin my morals. Gotta do something. Hey, baby. Stop selling weed, alright? You got your whole life ahead of you. You say, fuck you. Look, I can't see you. That's a guy. Can't do everything. Baby weed. You're gonna do something. Do a little weed. Weed. Weed's not as bad as everything else. It's weed is a background substance. You can smoke some herb and still function. You ain't crisp. But your function. Nothing higher than weed, though. I made that mistake one time. I said, a party's him. I gave him some shit. He said, here, man, take this. It's fucking mushrooms. I took it. I forgot all about it, you know. A couple days later, I found that shit in my pocket. I'm thinking, why not? Because I'm thinking it's like weed. Some background shit. I planned my whole day out like it was weed. I'll chew this shit up. Then I go to the barber shop, give my head cutting, and then I'll see a movie. I chewed it up so far, so good. Then I was in a barber shop, like an hour later. It's funny because I was just thinking to myself, I was like, this stuff sucks. Tastes like a head-least foot. I feel sick, but I'm not really high. Then I looked in the mirror. I saw the barber's reflection, man. It looked like a big penis was cutting my head. I freaked out. I started talking to myself, Dave, calm down. Here on drugs. This is what drugs do. You know that there is no way that a penis can cut hair. I started freaking out, man. I just couldn't take it anymore. I jumped out the chair, half my hair was cut. I didn't care. I had a dinner. I just gave a barber a handful of money. It was weird. The balls opened up. Anyway, I ran home, man. I ran home as fast as I could. It was tripping. I looked at the clock. It was 2.42. I was like, damn, 2.42. I got a sober up. I had never been this high, this early. I took a shower. I was still high. Said maybe musical do the trick. I listened to every CD I had. I was still high. Exercise. That's what I'll do. I ran around the box. Four times. Still high. Took a nap, woke up, fucked up. I looked at the clock. It was 2.43. I said, God, Dave. But there's more important reason that I would stop doing comedy right now. And this reason is the real reason that's been percolating. And it really is the crowd. Not you. I'm talking about the crowd on the big stage. It's too hard to entertain a country whose ears are so brittle. Motherfuckers are so sensitive, the whole country is turned into bitch ass niggas. Everybody you say upset somebody. But motherfuckers are just taking it too far. I don't know why or how everybody got this goddamn sensitive. You know who hates me the most, the transgender community. Yeah, these motherfuckers. I mean, I didn't realize how bad it was. These motherfuckers are really mad about that last Netflix special. It's tough, man. I don't know what to do about it because I like them. I always have. Never had a problem with them. You know, just fucking around. And that effect, I think I make fun of everybody. And I mean, as a group of people they have to admit, it's kind of fucking hilarious, man. I'm sorry, bro. I've never seen somebody in such a hilarious predicament not have a sense of humor about it. They're born feeling like there's something other than they're born as a net. That's kind of funny, you know what? It's funny if it's not happening to you. I believe transgenders. I don't understand them either, but I know they mean what they say. The niggas cut their dick off. That's all the proof I need. I've seen somebody just throw their dick away. Don't need it. I don't understand, but I believe you when I support your decision motherfucker. There's a problem in that feminist movement, isn't there? From its inception in America, there's always been a racial component. When Susan Beanley was having that meeting and sojourner Truce Black-ass showed up, read your history books. All the white women asked sojourner Truce not to speak. They didn't want to conflate the issues of women's rights and slavery. But you know how black bitches are? Sojourner Truce went up there anyway. She did a famous speech. She said, ain't I a woman? Ain't I a woman? That's right. And listen, listen, listen. I supported the Me Too movement. But the whole time, the whole time, I thought the way they handled that was stupid. It was. It was white. It was like, they were doing shit like going to the Golden Gloves and all of them would be like, let's all go to the Golden Gloves and wear black dresses to give these men a piece of our minds. Bitch, that is not going to work. You think, my mother's the king's going to be like, I want everybody to keep riding the bus, but wear matching outfits. You got to get off the bus and walk. It was real talk. It was a real talk. It was a silly movement. I want everybody to wear a crochet and push their hats so they know where serious. Who fuck was he all doing? And then I said, somebody bought it from one of my specials and all these women actresses came after me. I said, man, fuck y'all too, you can't. I ain't jerking off the none of your pictures again. They were like, who is he to tell us anything? I'll tell you exactly who I am. I am the one that got off the bus and left 50 million dollars on the bus and walked. I agreed with these women. I just didn't agree with what they were doing about. Right, right. No, it was annoying as fuck. Because if these women were serious, you know what they would have done? They all would have fired their agents. And they would have went to the mail room of one of these big agencies and found a woman that was busing her up and then said, if you want to talk to us, then you have to talk to her. And if they did that, then she would be big and they would be big and nobody would get fed the Harvey Weinstein. But did they do that? No. Was that their idea? No. Surprisingly, it was mine. What I think the feminist movement needs to be very successful is a male leader. I'll do it. I will. I will lead you women to the promised land. I will make sure you get equal pay, equal work. I will make sure that nobody harasses you. Well, fucks with you on the job. I will protect all of your interests and all that I ask for in return. Was that you sucked my dick? Tell me was one of my first white friends like in my life, man. Good dude, too. He moved to Silver Spring from Utah of all places. I guess his family was affiliated with that Mormon church they got down there. I mean, him used to hang out. And one day I was at his house, we were just hanging out and Timmy says, Dave, why don't you stay for dinner tonight? I said, oh man, I'd love to, but I can't. If I'm not home before dark, my mother will kill me. That was a lie. My mother had several jobs. I hadn't seen her like three or four days. And the only reason I lied to Timmy was because at that point in my life, it was my experience that white dinner wasn't delicious. I'd rather go home and fry some baloney or some shit like that. But then old Timmy threw me a curveball. I wasn't expecting. He said, oh, it's too bad you can't stay, Dave, because my mom made stove top stuffing. I said, what the fuck stove top? Oh, no, nigga, let me make some phone calls real quick. I had seen that commercial so many times. I had dreamt of getting my hands on some of that stove top stuffing. And finally, I met a mother fucking that actually had a box of stove top in the house. I couldn't miss this opportunity. So I pretended to call my mother. And then I came back and I said, Timmy, Timmy, you're not going to believe this great news. Mom said, I can stay. And he said, fantastic. He said, why don't you come with me and we'll help set the table and then we can say the blessing. I had no interest in setting this mother fuckers table of saying these crazy ass Mormon prayers. I just wanted to goddamn stuffing. So I told Timmy, I said, you know what? I'd love to help. I'll wash my hands first. My plan was simple. Wash my hands slowly and by the time I'm done, the table will be sent. The blessing will be said and all that there will be left to do is eat. I went to the bathroom. I washed my hands very slowly. I must have been in there for about ten minutes. And suddenly, one of his mothers came to the door. She was like, hi, David, right? I said, yes, ma'am. She said, Timmy tells me that you're planning on staying for dinner. I said, I hope that's not a problem, ma'am. She says, no, it's no problem. In fact, we'd love to have you. It's just that we weren't expecting company. And I'm afraid there's not enough stove top stuffing for everybody. So I kicked her in the pussy. Bam! Ladies and gentlemen, I told you I'm dope, nigga. I told you I was gonna say it and you still didn't see it coming. And that's why I make the big box. No, I feel real bad for is Indians. Everybody feels bad for Indians. They get doled openly. Because everybody thinks they're dead. These motherfuckers are not all dead, all right? I've seen with my own eyes, I've seen a gathering of 1500 Native Americans. They were all gathered in one place. The place is called Walmart, New Mexico. Who's Indians? I've never seen Indians before. I wasn't even sure if they were Indians. I just fucked up, but I asked one of them. It's not nice, but I seen them in the sports section looking at bows and arrows. I had to say something. Oh, excuse me. I don't mean to be rude. Are you Indian? And he was cool. Yes. Yes, I am Indian. Still didn't believe him. I had to test him to be sure. This is fucked up. But I had a gum wrapper in my pocket. I had a gum wrapper and I had to get it all that shit up. And I threw it on the floor. And a single tear came out of his ass. Oh, shit. I had so many questions. What trap are you from? I am a Navajo. I said, it worked. I studied you in social studies. You're a hunter-gatherer, correct? I said, I guess so. That's what you wish to call it. I said, why, what are you calling? He said, I am an alcoholic. I said, what's your name, dog? He said, please. Dog is my cousin. That's a good guess. My name is Ronan Coyote. What is your name, friend? And that shit called me off-guard. I didn't want to say my name was Dave, two motherfuckin' name, Ronan Coyote. He just don't feel good enough. He was putting me on the spot. I said, huh? My name's black. Oh, my name's Blackfeet. Then I changed the subject. Forget about me, what's going on with you? I want to meet your chief. Why don't you and your chief and your friends get together tonight? We could have a real-life piecepipe smoke and ritual. We need to celebrate. And I thought you were dead. And he set it up. It was beautiful. It was just like I dreamed. It was all sitting around. And then he was beating the drum. Other Indians came out the back with a long blanket that was folded in half and puttin' in front of us. Open that shit up, and on the blanket was a long wooden pipe with feathers. And bags of weed all over the blanket. Chief walked over. The big ones are 50. The little ones are 25. And these are 10. And the big ones are 50. And they were all 50. The men of Indians got high as shit. I was beggined. I told the chief. He was talking. I cut him off. Time out, chief. Sorry in the rough. Fucking smashed, man. The weeds too strong. And the chief threw some water in my face. Calm down, black face. Splash! I said, hey, it's black feet, motherfucker. Take it easy. Black feet. You're welcome to stay amongst me and my tribe for the night until the spirits leave you. And they gave me my own TP to sleep in. Which sounds nice. I personally felt like it was a little fucked up. Because they all had houses, man. It's like, why can't I sleep with you all in the house and watch TV? I can't be on this great. Now, I was hanging out with a friend of mine. He's a white guy. We were just hanging out. And we were lost in the city. You know, we smoked in a joint. Now, I don't know if it's a coincidence that we were lost in the high end shit. My wife, but he was smoking to join in. Dave, Dave, Mr. Goddamn cops. I'm going to ask him for directions. I said, chip, no, chip, don't do it. It was too late. He was walking over to this man with high shit. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Touching him and shit. Excuse me. Need some information. It's not confessing things. You shouldn't confess. I'm a little high. All I want to know, which way is third street? The cop was like, hey, take it easy. You're on third street. You better be careful. Go ahead, move it. Move it. That's all that happened. That's the end of the story. Now, I know that's not amazing to some of you. But you have one of these black fellas. That shit is fucking incredible, isn't it? I'm saying, a black man will never dream of talking to police high. That's a waste of weed. That's a waste of weed. Who's that? Seriously. I'm obviously going to talk to police when I'm sleepy. It's fucking around and get the wrong ideas. Oh. Oh, my God. That nigga was on PCP Johnson. No, no, no paperwork. Just sprinkle some crack on him. Let's get out of here. That's how it is, but at the time I didn't think was anything racial about it. I was just like, man, Chip, you got fucking lucky, but I'll be careful. But then another time, me and Chip are driving. Now I'm not driving. Chip is driving and he's driving a little crazy. He's been drinking. I don't like to let my friends drive drunk, but you know, I was smoking a joint. I couldn't really say shit to the guy. We get it a red light. We stop it a red light and the car pulls up next to us and I'll never forget it. Chip, he looks at me as old drunk as he's like, Dave. I'm gonna race him. I knew it was a bad idea, but I was hot. I tried to explain to him it was a bad idea, but all that came out was, well, I think it's sometimes a guy race, I don't know. Man, bad light turned green and Chip took off. He's hanging in the ship so no one could pass him. I don't know how to know he was racing. Then the police seen us and pulled us over. I'm scared of shit. I mean, come on. The cosmo was like, we've been speeding this man as fucking drunk. I'm scared. Chip was not scared at all. It was weird. He didn't turn his radio down. I mean, if you could put over when you turn your radio down, nobody would get their ASB to a soundtracking shit. I'm saying, Chip had the music blasting, we're not gonna take it. What are the numbers that Dave just relaxed? Close your butt cheeks. Relax. Let me do the talking. You want to know what he said? He's almost exactly what he said. I kind of believe it. He says, oh, sorry officer, I didn't know I couldn't do that. I was fucking shocked. The cops said, well now you know, just get out of here. Just get the fuck out of here. Chip said, okay, I will sir. Thank you. What? What's wrong with you Dave? I didn't know I couldn't do that. He said that was good, wasn't it? Because I didn't know I couldn't do that. I'm not for abortion. I'll shut up nigga. I'm not for it, but I'm not against it either. It all depends on who I get pregnant. I don't care what your religious beliefs are or anything. If you have a dick, you need to shut the fuck up on this one. Seriously. This is theirs. The right to choose is their unequivocal rights. Not only do I believe they have the right to choose, I believe that they shouldn't have to consult anybody except for a physician about how they exercise that right. Gentlemen, that is fair. And ladies, to be fair to us, I also believe if you decide to have the baby, a man should not have to pay. That's fair. If you can kill this motherfucker, I can at least abandon him. It's my money, my choice. And if I'm wrong, then perhaps we're wrong. Just fake that shit out for yourselves. I mean, really, what the fuck are we doing? I can't live in this new world you're proposing. And meanwhile, I worry about all this other shit. Look at what's happening. They just killed another 12 people and mass-shooting Virginia Beach. This is happening every week. It happens so much. I'm almost out-candy-more. I came home early from the road. I had a 12,000-dollar suit on because ice been going good. And I got home early and dinner was cooking. You ever come home and dinner's cooking? Then it smelled good. And my son saw me and he was like, dance home. And he got up from the table and ran over to give me a hug. But he had chicken grease all over his face. So I stepped on him and I'm like, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, my man, my man. Watch these threads, son. It's an expensive suit. I don't want you to get the chicken grease all over me. And he was like, what the chicken grease? Damn, this is duck. Tear came out of my ass. I never dreamt I'd do so well in life that I'd raise a nigga with duck grease all over his face. It's one time racism saved my life, man. I was on a plane. I was coming from overseas. And I don't know how this guy got a machine gun on the plane. But he stood up, man. He said, everybody, get on me fucking ground. Nobody look at my face. I started freaking out because he was Chinese. I was like, well, how's he talking like that? He was screaming and crying. I was the only brother on the plane. Well, I thought I was the only brother. I looked over. It was one of the black dudes. He was from Nigeria. I looked over them. He was looking right in my face, man. He didn't say two words to me. He just looked at me. He was like, pff. He didn't need to talk. I know we just were talking. I looked right back in. So my dudes on the front of the plane seen us. They were like, oh my god. I think those black guys are going to try to save us. We were just communicating that we understood the situation. We were both seeing the same thing. What we understood was simple. Paris don't take black hostages. That's the truth. I have yet to see one of us on the news. Readin' the house is that, isn't it? They are treating us good. We are chilling as shit. I like to give a shout out to Ray Ray and Big Steve and Justin Luke for us. You're not going to see it. And terrorists are smart. They know what they're doing there. They're terrorists. They know what black people's bad bargaining chips. They call the White House. Hello. We have got five blood. Hello. You'll be back in DC. You know what I'm going to say, man? This is an election year. I'm asking you, your wife, do you know who you're voting for yet? Don't know, do you? Now you see that? You see what just happened here? Let me tell you something. That is a cultural thing. He knows who is going to vote for. He's just not going to tell me. I've noticed that. That is a cultural thing. Why people do not like to talk about their political affiliations? It's a secret. You know, that's why I always want to vote for you. Hey, Bob, Bob, who are you going to vote for? Take it easy now. Take it easy. So anyway, I was fucking my wife and a rat. And I mean, it was something else. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But who are you voting for? Dave. Dave, come on with the voting. I'm trying to talk about the fucking my wife here. Ask me all these personal questions. They don't like to divulge that information because it matters to them. Black people talk about that shit. Black people will openly talk about politics. Black people will openly talk about beating up politicians as shit. I see George Bush, our kickers motherfucking ass for cutting my Medicaid. Oh, okay, let me go and say it. I would just say it. But there's a reason for that. There's a matter is more for the matters more. People see, it's even when I vote, right? Which I don't. But, but, but even when I think about like who I would vote for, right? I don't even look at their political policies. I just look at their character. You know what I'm saying now? You got to read. No, I'm serious. You got to read. Between the lies. You know, you look at Clinton and white people like Clinton because we've seen him on a camp. That's all one thing on a campaign trail. He actually just picked up black baby up and kicked me. Come here little nigga baby. Oh, I like that. He did not have the pain or nothing. You see George Bush doing it. He being in. Like see, I had never vote for George Bush Jr. But I don't know George Bush Jr.'s politics. I don't think I know about George Bush Jr. is that that guy sniff cocaine. That's right. Now listen, we cannot have that shouldn't a white house. That might be fine for a mayor, but God damn it, not my house. Right there. I'm saying. The states are too high in the white house. Can't have no coke here, president. Maybe selling nuclear seekers for $20, $30 in shit. Could be a meetings in Barrison America. Come on. Sound a treaty baby. I suck your dick like what? You missed it. You're welcome.
Guys, I'm telling you, this is it. This is, I've tried everything, okay? This is my shining moment as a father for you. I've tried wrapping up a pancake like a burrito with syrup on it, but that gets way too messy. I've tried taking a bite of a pancake, then just pouring syrup into my mouth to get that right ratio. That has not worked. What I have found works the best is you cut the center out of the pancake, right? You remove the center, then you pour syrup into the center. So that's going to soak up that syrup right in the middle, and that's going to be the best part of the pancake. Plus, what you've done without even knowing it is you've saved a dad in the middle of the pancake. That's the greatest bite-ad pancake history. Dad, don't you have to go to a show. Figure out the tip. Who's going to do it? I got it. I got it. Because I know for every $10, you leave a $2 bill. So this is $30, so that's $3, $2 bills. That's six money. That's perfect, man. That's actually a great way to think about it. Way to go. Yeah, don't forget your passport. All right, we got to move. Let's go. Ladies and gentlemen, Chad Daniel. Hi, everyone. Hello. Hi. I'm glad you're here. This is going to be OK. I want you to know that I know that I don't look like you thought I would. Take it in. I realize that. My kids remind me that I've gotten older every day. Kamma, every day. I dropped my son off one time and he goes, God, you've aged like a president. And then my daughter goes, I was thinking guacamole. So they're pretty cool, right? Yeah, great. I grew a beard. That can make a guy look older. But I grew a beard for two reasons. Number one, beards are like sweatpants for your face. Doesn't matter how chubby you're getting when you're wearing one. Man, I grew a beard for a whole year. And then shaved it to the skin. What an asshole. Who does that? I mean, just in one thing. I looked in the mirror and I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It was crazy. What was I doing? Just sat in my bathroom all night going, ah, trying to push hair out of my face. But that's just how you hurt your back. The other reason I grew a beard is because my 18 year old son challenged me to a beard growing contest. And he lost because he is 18. You ever seen an 18 year old's beard? Oh my god, they're so gross. It's like a daddy long leg. He's just crawling out feet first. Like a whisker up here and a whisker over here. I have a grandmother that could beat this kid in a beard growing contest. Use an only moles. I think my son challenged me to a beard growing contest because pubic hair grew in on other parts of his body and that grew in full. Does that is how pubic hair works? Nobody has patchy pubes. Let me rephrase that. I don't think anybody has patchy pubes. Some of you shut down on that one. You're like, hey, buddy, right here. What are you doing out of the house? Just stay home and fix your dick manger, whatever. It's probably not called that, but that's what I'm going to call it. I have never seen pubic hair on my son's body, but I have for sure seen it shaved off of his body onto my toilet seat. You know where my toilet seat is? That's in my bathroom. That's an easy one. Everyone should have got that. Do you know where my bathroom is? That is in my bedroom. So that means he walked through my bedroom and he is not allowed in there because clothes go missing and pillows get moved. And I don't trust that. A crooked pillow is a mystery. I don't want us off. So that goes in the garbage immediately. I just picture him straddling my toilet. And I know he straddled it because there are only pubes on the back half of the toilet seat. If you have a better theory, I'll listen, but there isn't one. That's the only way because I know he wasn't using painter's tape and shit to straighten it out. Hold on, it's not even yet. Let me get a laser level. I got it. Just over my toilet. Fee-oh, fee-oh, fee-oh. Like he's making a pair of ugboots. Walking out of my bathroom like, fuck it, my dad will clean it up. I'm 18, I don't try. You know, whatever kids say when you're not around. The main problem I have with these pubes on the toilet is that during this story, my kids live with me Sunday to Wednesday. They live with their mother Wednesday to Sunday. And he shaved his pubes Wednesday before he went to school. That means he was not going to be home for four days. So I called the cell phone when he was at school to leave a message, but he answered because he is not a good student. And I said, hey man, found some pubes. And he said, where? Which leads me to believe. I have not found all the pubes. What do you mean where? Why are there options to this conversation? Am I going to happen upon more pubes later this afternoon? Boy, I sure hope not, because I taught him not a prank and I know he's real good at it. I haven't checked, but I bet you there are pubes in my sleeping bag right now. That's a hard-ass burn. Many naps on their camping. The first time you get in that bag, the food is in the tree and the fire is out and you're like, oh, I can't wait to get some. Those are pubes. You got me. So I said, hey man, why did you shave the pubes at my house? And he goes, because mom is not there to yell at me. And I said, that is the dumbest answer I've ever heard. So get back here after school and clean these up. And he said, I'm sorry, father, but according to the custody agreement, I'm at mother's now. And I know that was meant to make me mad, but it didn't. I was thrilled he used two three syllable words in one sentence. Because I have watched him walk into a wall during the daytime. Natural sunlight guiding his way and just still, funk. So I waited till Sunday and he came to my house and said, hey man, come give me a hug. And he came to give me a hug like this. And when he did, I spun him around and I put him in a full Nelson. And I walked him up the stairs and I walked him into my bathroom. And I bent him over the toilet like I was rubbing a dog's nose in its own shit. Because the pubes were still there. They're not mine. I'm not cleaning those off. I walked downstairs in my own home for four straight days to use the bathroom because I am committed to parenting. So I haven't bent over the toilet and he starts making the weirdest noise. He started going like that. And I panicked a little bit because when he was two, he had asthma. When he was seven, it went away because of a nebulizer. And I thought, oh my god, did I give my kid back asthma? But I didn't. Turns out he was just blow and pubed dust. To create a clean breathing area. Once I figured that out, I could not stop laughing. Because I had come to the realization, my son is pubic care waterboarding himself. And that hits the spot. I was laughing so hard. My grip loosened. He finally wiggles around and he goes, why are you doing this to me? Because your mom's not here to yell at me anymore either. Thank you. I used to have a story about when my son turned 18, I was going to punch him in the face. He's 18 now. On his birthday, I got up early. I set my alarm. And he went downstairs and made myself a good breakfast. And then I heard him getting up. And I go, here we go. It's game time. My heart started racing. My hands got sweaty. Mom spaghettie. So dumb. Oh god. I started giving myself a pep talk. I was like, you can punch him. He's 18. You can do this. Because you did not spank him. And these are all the spankings. That he should have coming to him. And then I heard him coming down the stairs. So I started walking towards the bottom of the staircase. I turned the corner and I just saw a little boy walking towards me. And I was like, you can't punch this little boy. But here's what you can do. You can put a hockey helmet on him and hockey gloves. And then you can put those on as well. And we can go in the backyard and we can lock your box. So that's what we did. And I kept hitting him in the shoulder. And he goes, it doesn't even hurt. What are you doing? And I was like, all right, just wait. And then the third round, he could not lift his hands up to protect his face. That's old man knowledge. President style. After we lock our box, I went inside and I checked my social media. And there were over a thousand messages asking if I had punched my son in the face. Happy birthday. That's kind of world we live in, I guess. So I replied to all these messages. I said, no, I couldn't punch him in the face. I didn't think it'd be fair to him. So instead we went in the backyard and we lock our box. And then I put my phone away. And then 24 hours later, I checked and I got a message from a man in Little Rock, Arkansas. And he had replied back to me with a picture of urban dictionaries definition of locker box. And I would like to tell you, it is not what I thought. Urban dictionaries definition of locker box is when you're having sex with someone, you also shove your nuts into them. I mean, where do you even start? Do people do that? And it's so how? How do you do that? The only thing I know about that sexual position is you probably need the lights on. That does not seem like a feel around job to finish it. So anyways, I sent over 1000 people a message from my home computer that said, no, man, I didn't punch him in the face. You know, because that wouldn't be fair. Instead, I brought him in the backyard and I put my balls up there. And I was nervous that the green light on my computer was going to come on on the camera. And it would just be the feds like, what else is going on over there? My son no longer lives with me. Not because a locker box or whatever. He went to one semester at college and didn't like it. That's fair for me. But he also didn't want to get a job. And that's where I drew the line because I just can't. So let him go through the holidays. We did all that stuff, hung out a lot. And then January 1st, I said, you owe me $400 rent. And then if you don't have a job by February 1st, I'm going to kick you out. If you do have a job by February 1st, I'm going to give you 200 of that 400 back. And we're going to call that a happy father rebate. And then if you have a job, the first of every month, you're going to pay me $200 rent for the rest of time until I kick you out permanently. And he goes, 200. What about 150 and I buy my own milk? Who in the fuck drinks $50 worth of milk in a year? Are you having bone problems? What's going on? It's probably why I can't find a job. He's a horrible negotiating. We'll give you $17 an hour. What about 16 and I'll drive myself here? Well, you would be expected 14. Okay, we're no longer hiring. The first month my son left, my electric bill went down $80. That's a lot. Want to know why? Because his hobby is leaving my lights on. It's like a passion project for him. He wears a fit bit around his wrists and I bet he gets 10,000 steps a day. Just turn him a goddamn lights on. All around the house. That's a lot of green. I know all my lights are on at all times because I live in a place where a lot of people like to hunt. My friends will get up early at 4 in the morning and they'll drive out to hunt and they'll go by my house and then they'll call me and say, hey, are you home? I go, no, why? Well, because all your lights are on. Well, which ones? Yeah, all of them. Ports to garage, buddy. Ports to garage. And you want to know why they're on? Because my son's scared when he's there by himself. That's the only logical reason. He's tough. I mean, he wanted to live there, right? He doesn't live with me full time at that point. You know, because he loves me more than his mom, no. Because he's long at the freedom when I was on the road working. I'm tough. I'm gonna live with my dad's house. And when he's gone, it's gonna be my house. Because I'm tough. Until the wind blows a tree and the branch scratches the house. Bane, bane, bane, bane, bane, bane. Just a step, brrrrrrrrr. Operation sunshine. You can still run it into walls. I also have a 14 year old daughter and I gave her a chore list with three words on it and she goes, where's your chore list? You ever had a kid say something to you that they're serious but then you almost ruin it because you laugh? That's what I was like, oh girl, what? And I just go, what did you say? And she goes, where's your... She slowed it down. Like I didn't... Like I actually didn't hear her, you know? So I said, you know everything that happens in this house to make this home operate? Subtract the three things I asked you to do and that is my chore list. Remember when you woke up in a bed warm and not hungry? Fuckin' check! Check! Check! I did that shit. So my chore list also has three words on it and it says, keep her alive. And it expires in four years. So focused. She's 14 now. She was 12. I started listening to podcasts about periods. And I know that seems creepy. I'm positive I'm on a list somewhere. But I never wanted to be the dad that had to send her to her mom to ask her all those questions. I don't want you to know like, that's a question for your mom. You know where to find me if you want to play catch. I mean it's ridiculous, right? So I was listening to these podcasts but I had to stop because one of them kind of creeped me out. And it said, if you're going to show your daughter how to use a tampon you push it into your hand and then so I was like, well yeah, my hand's been a vagina. Okay, that makes sense. Sure. If you're looking for a number you're not going to get it. Just know that it has been. But then I pictured myself pushing a tampon into my hand and oh my god, it just looks like a magic trick. Doesn't it not? Just like, hey, whoo. Where's the tampon? You better find it because toxic shock is real. My daughter got her period in my house for the first time and she came down stairs and she goes, dad, two things. Number one, got my period. Number two, don't want to talk about it. And I was like, number one, great. Number two, greater. And she said, I have to go to mom's house because she bought me some stuff. And I said, I don't know if you've heard about the new legislation that was just passed but dads are now allowed to buy things. They're letting us out of the house. So I said, come upstairs. I mean, we went upstairs and I opened the closet next to the laundry room and in there was one box of all of the each. I had all the kinds, all every box that they make. Or at least they were at the store because I got there and I was like, oh, that's different. All right, oh, that's different too. And I got all of them. And that cost $217 where I met. And I said, whatever you need for this is going to be in here because that is every kind. They don't make any more than that. If you need something that isn't in there, sorry about your square vagina. And in that case, we are going to have to call your mom because she's way better at making appointments. And then she just goes, God, you're so dumb. And she grabbed a box and goes, it's right here. I know what I need. And then she left. I don't have anything to do. So I brought back $211 worth of tampons. That is an interesting exchange. There were so many boxes left and you can't carry them in because they're all individual boxes. So I had to walk in the target, get an empty cart and just walk out with an empty cart. And people were like, is this bitch stealing a cart? What is going on? So then I loaded it up with all the tampons and I brought it back in and I brought it up to the exchange counter and the guy goes, you checking out? And I go, hmm, checking in. And he looked at my cart and he looked at me and he just goes, I mean, what happened? That is a reasonable question. But I didn't know I was going to get asked. So I panicked and I just went, she said, pancake mix. If we could get this done, everybody's real hungry at the house. In my opinion, it is harder raising a 14 year old daughter and an 18 year old son than when they were little. Because when they were little, I could give them all the same rules. I could sit them down in the couch and say, hey, don't break anything. Don't drink my chocolate milk and go outside until it is dark. And they would go, all right, dad, that was it. But now I can't do that. I have to give them individual rules and it takes longer and I don't like it. I don't think, I also don't think it is fair. I have to tell my daughter, you are going to a party. We will keep your water bottle close to you and keep the cap on. If you are going to play hide and seek, please don't run into the woods with four boys even if they are your friends. Because people could start talking and then that is not going to be great. I don't have to tell that to my son, hey, if you are going to a party, please don't run into the woods with four girls because people could start talking and then they are going to think you are awesome. That is a really weird double standard that I don't like. I tell my daughter a ton of stuff when she leaves the house. You know what I tell my son? Drive safe, don't rape. That is it. That is it. That is every single thing I want him to know. Some of you might be like, you can't say rape, Chad. Well, you sure can if you say don't in front of it. Yeah. That is like the number one time they want you saying it. I am pretty sure. One time a guy after a show, honestly asked me, he goes, why would you tell your son, drive safe, don't rape? And I just was like, I really did think that was self-explanatory. But if you are looking for an answer, here it is. I want him to arrive safely and then when he does, to not rape anyone. I don't think he is going to but it doesn't hurt to remind people of big things. Drive safe, don't rape. That is four words. They are all one syllable. Sounds like a caveman. Drive safe, don't rape. And that works well for 18 year old boys because they are cavemen. Drive safe, don't rape. Me! Yeah, you buddy. You for sure, but everybody, everybody. Hintu! Hintu and me, just like Durant. There you go. Oh, damn. Okay, Dad. I got it. Fire good. Yeah, fire is good. Fire good rape, Dad. Isaac, smart. Isaac, smart. I'm going to start saying that everywhere I go. I mean, not like a caveman because that would creep people out, of course. You can't walk down the street. Just like Durant. Everybody would be like, oh, he lost his shaperone. I think it's a good message. I think guys should say it to guys all the time. I don't think there's any harm in it. Plus, you're going to learn a lot about someone that you say it to. Here's your change. Have a great day. Thank you so much. Don't rape. Why would you say don't rape to me? If that ever happens to you, you are face to face with a rapist. Because why else would you freak out that much? I thought about it. If I was walking down the street and somebody goes, hey man, don't rape. I'd be like, oh my god, I was just thinking that. Thank you. You too. I've also told my son that if he's on a date, and it's not going well, it doesn't want a second date, but the girl wants to kiss him at the end of that date, we'll just don't. Because that's going to be a real awkward situation later on. It's going to be awkward for sure in those five minutes. But that's okay. That's five minutes. You don't want to have that shit go on forever. And if you don't believe me, why don't you call Aziz, see what he thinks about it. That come out of the mic wrong? What happened? Aziz got in trouble for having a bad date. He's a famous comedian for those who don't know. There was a girl that he went on a date with, and he wanted to have sex with that girl, and she wanted a famous boyfriend, and neither of that worked. There is so much dumb on both sides of this story, it is mind-blowing to me. For those of you that never read the article, here's what happened. They got home from dinner, she sat on his kitchen counter, and then they both agreed that he was going to put his this part on her this part. Immediately when they got home. It's like a kid hitting a ball at Little League and running right to third. I mean, yeah, it's adorable, but there are rules here. Then they both agreed that she was going to put her this part on his this part two times. Gentlemen, I think we can all agree that no means no every single time. But what about, uh-huh, even then for sure. But then ladies, you also have to agree that no one can hear you saying no when you voluntarily put their dick in your mouth two times. In the article, she was quoted as saying he wasn't getting my non-verbal cues. Well, where I'm from, sucking a dick is not a good one. I'm not having any fun, gah, gah. I mean, that is not how you call Uber. Everybody knows that. Everyone knows. It's an app. The reason I bring this up is because I think sometimes we shift the spotlight from where it needs to be, right? My daughter's 14. I'd like to have this shit figured out in four years. We do. We shift it. The Me Too movement is super serious. Have you read some of the stories? They're gut-wrenching and heartbreaking. And then there are some where it's just like, all right, there was a lady from Michigan who got her a scrap by President Bush senior 27 years ago. And that was her Me Too story. And like, you read the other ones and you're like, how are you limping in with this bullshit? He didn't finger your ass hole. And I want to be very, very clear about something. In no way am I blaming this woman. But I feel like all of us learn at a very young age to not stand in front of an old man for any reason at all. They are the grossest things, not people, things on the whole planet. It goes old men, monkeys, seaweed. Those are the top three grossest things on the whole planet Earth. Monkeys throw shit at you. Yeah, that's an easy number two. I got it. Seaweed. Messes with you when you're swimming. You don't know what it is. You can't see underwater. Old men do both of those things. An old man will throw shit up into the air so you look at it just so he can give you a wet willy. They're the creepiest things ever. Have you ever swam with an old man? It's always just like, bad at bad at bad at bad at. Like they're tits floating on top of the water. Like an oil spill. Like when you make a pancake, you know I'm talking how it spreads out. Just bad at bad. I'd rather get eaten by a shark at that point. That's weird. Now some people may think, Chad, you just think this way because you're a man. Well, that has to be part of it. My brain has been connected to a dick for quite a while. But I believe that all of our lenses are tinted from several different things. I was also raised by a very strong single mother. And so I watched her operate in different situations. And that's what I learned. If my mom would have got her ascribed by anyone, doesn't matter if it's a president, she wouldn't have went away for 27 years. She would have done one of two things immediately. She would have had a churned around and said, do it again and then break your hand. Or she would have just yelled, this piece of shit just scrapped my ass. And yeah. I don't know if you know this, but that's how you end the picnic. And my sister and I would have been just cowering in the car like, oh man, we should clean the house a week at home. You know, because she's pretty mad. Did you see what happened? I didn't even see it, but there was an old guy as a pride him. I live in the same small town where I grew up and nobody likes me from a long time ago. And I know that sounds sad, but it's pretty freeing. Like, and say whatever I want, and I'm not going to lose friends. I'm there. I was at a small cafe and a woman was reading the article about the lady for Michigan. And she said, can you believe this? And I said that they would waste that much ink on that? No, I can't. And then everyone turned their chair to look at both of us. Like we were going to lock her box or something. And she said, I will have you know, a female American president would never grab an ass. And I said, well, neither would a unicorn because neither of them exists. You can get as mad as you want, but you can't do an experiment with a group that doesn't have any fucking people in it. I thought she had it locked. She wears pantsuits on purpose. What a great presidential candidate. But 45% of people that look just like her said, maybe next time. You want to know why? Because women don't get along. And I know there's this movement. Yes, we do, but you don't. You're at the movement with a picket sign and you have the same one. You're like, oh, fuck this. I mean, it's... And that's sad to me because you're easily the better of the two sexes. You should own everything, but you're busy bickering your way to second place. It's crazy then. A man could punch a man in the face and have a beer with that save man five minutes later. A lady could hear some shit. She maybe thought was about her and hate that bitch till she dies. It's crazy, you guys. Why? Are you doing that? Here's my theory. I feel like you don't get along because you've been pitt against one another since you were little kids. You're going to school, oh, you better get all cute and get pittails so you can find a boy. You don't want to be an old maid, right? That's crazy that you had to listen to that shit. How is the human species, the only species where women have to look nice? Have you seen nature? Have you seen a beautiful peacock? That's a dude. That's a dude peacock. Just, ah, look what I got. Have you ever seen a female peacock? Fucking gross. They're like, they're gray. They're gray and just sloppy. But they have a vagina. So they win, the whole thing. Women, you should not ever have to put on makeup. You should be able to walk into a bar and just go, I'll be in the car. It's bunkers. I also think it would be nice if we could all have the same rules. Let's make a big rule book that everybody agrees on. I think being an individual is amazing and what makes the planet great. However, everyone has their own rules and you can't get to know someone in a day for all their rules. So I have a friend on Facebook and she posted, am I ever going to be able to go to a bar by myself and not have a man ask if I'm okay? And no, is the answer. And that sucks, but it worked once. I don't know when, let's say the 40s. There was a lady drinking a drink all by herself in the bar and a man walked in and he goes, are you okay? And then they had sex and he told everyone he'd ever met. And that story's been passed down from generation to generation. Little boys are walking home from their grandfather's homes like, ask if she's okay. Ask if she's okay. Because we're simple creatures. We go with what works. And seventh grade, a teacher told me I look nice and sweaters. Here we are. Here we are. Now, somebody will like me again. That's good. Welcome back. Welcome back. I try to stay out of the rest of the politics because it's too demanding. And I like to sleep. Hey Chad, did you hear about, no I didn't, good night. It's like my new move. I do think politics divides us and makes us softer because I mean people are so fake taken aback when it comes to every opinion. They're like, I don't want my friend to think that I think this and they don't think that. And then we've been going, I'm surprised we haven't changed our national anthem to. I know we're getting soft as a country because one time I heard a guy go, if I could just be half the man my father was, well you are, that's how genetics works. You also have to woman your mom was and you're acting like her right now so get your shit together. And I'll tell you this, I don't even like that joke. I just like to watch some of the women laugh and some of the women not laugh because it proves you don't get along. It's crazy. It's right just set it and you're back on track already. All right. I think we're getting softer as a country people say sorry all the time when they don't need to. Right. You ever been bumped into and somebody goes, oh sorry. Yeah? For what? You just barely bumped into me. Have you been planning this for two weeks? Because then an apology is necessary. But this seems like an excuse me moment. Right? Like what are you going to say when someone important to me dies? Right. Like, oh I'm so sorry. Same way like when you bumped into me. I went to Starbucks and once I go, hey man are you in line? I go, yeah I am sorry. Yeah for what? Getting here faster? So I stood right in front of him. And he goes, hey man I am in line and go, yeah but you're sorry. So I'm just trying to help with the guilt. My daughter says sorry nonstop. My daughter will say sorry three times for the same thing. And now you're just being an asshole. Sorry once. You can't keep doing it and think sorry is going to get you off the hook. So I have a swear jar in my house that costs you a quarter. I have a sorry jar that will cost you a dollar. What's the lesson there? Call your dad a piece of shit. Just don't apologize for it. Because that is a 400% markup. My home is also filled with hyperbole because of my daughter. Everything is the best or the worst. Or the funniest. And can I tell you something? It never is. You know something is going to be really funny when someone laughs all the way through it right? The dad you're not going to believe this funniest thing ever happened to me. Oh my god, it's a funny thing. Oh my god, wait that. Okay let's hear it. There's a girl running through the hall and she fell off and is the funniest thing ever. Oh dad please. When either one of my kids tells me stories, my face must just glaze over. Because all I am thinking is how in the world do some people have sex with their own children. Does that make sense to anyone else in this room? How does a human brain allow that kind of shit to take place? I am so utterly turned off by both of my kids in every single way. And by the way if you're not laughing right now, you're the creepiest person in this room. Because that as easily as anti-kid touching as it gets. I said how in the world, you know, earth, the world, the whole world, do some people have sex with their own children and some of you went, uh-uh. I'm protected, second amendment. Everybody knows you can't change an amendment Chad because a man means, all right hold on. That's how I'm going to start choosing hotels when I'm on the road. I'm going to walk into a lobby and be like how in the world do some people have sex with their own children. And if no one even looks up, I'll be like okay cool next hotel. Sometimes when I tell that story, someone will laugh so hard their shoulders will shake. And other times someone won't even smile. But on a magical night, those two people are sitting right next to each other. And I get so excited about the idea of that uncomfortable ride home. The air could you care if we stop by the gas station and get some skittles? I don't know Patrick, why don't you go fuck again? You heard me say skittles right? I know we're getting soft as a nation because I travel all around it and I hear soft noises in comedy clubs. One time heard a grown man go, oh, that's crazy. If that is the noise your body chooses to make, stay home always and forever. Because no one likes you for sure. But the worst noise I've ever heard of the comedy shows this one, I don't. Man or woman, that is the twattiest noise that can come out of the human body. You should be able to karate chop that out of somebody's throat. Hey man, how's your day? I don't. Fwatt! Hatt! Hatt! I would rather hear choking than hear that noise. Because you know who makes that noise? It's people that wake up every morning and think, how could I be a victim today? And you know who I'm talking about. It's people that don't get enough attention at work, they don't get enough attention at home. So they're on social media posting all these vague ass statuses. Sure could use some prayers today. Post. It's like you can almost hear them typing it. I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't have to be kidding me. Knock it off. What do you need prayers for? Be specific. Everybody's worried sick about you. There's 150 comments and they're all some version of Mary sending good vibes your way. Raising the roof with prayer. Emoji. And four days later Mary comes back to meadows weren't as red as I'd hoped. Well fuck you Mary. I hope you get lupus and everybody's all prayed out. But your tomatoes are red, right? They'll have antioxidants, won't they, Mary? Best of luck to you little girl that cried prayer. How can we not test for the noise? Mmm, I don't, mmm. We can test for almost anything in utero, right? Let's get one of those fancy ultrasound machines and figure it out. That's your baby's heartbeat. Mmm, I don't, mmm. We should get that out of you immediately. Nobody wants another one of those walking around town. And you do not want to live with the third grader that doesn't want Oreos because they're made with hydrogenated oil. I don't, mmm. Fucking die. I'm just dying. When I hear the noise, mmm, I don't, mmm. I get ISIS. I get it. I understand starting a group to hurt other people. That makes sense to me. Does that mean I'm a joint ISIS? Of course not. But I scout for them. I don't know, probably. Hey man, how's your salad? Mmm, I don't, ISIS! I found one. You don't want to mess with ISIS, man. They're a crappy group. And we should have seen that coming because they are all caps. And you guys, that's yelling. How did we not know? I bet if you asked everybody in ISIS why they joined over 40% would say traffic. Because traffic can turn a reasonable rational human being into a murderous monster. You're ever going to the four-way stop and it's not your turn to go, but it's a person in front of you. It's their turn to go. But they're not going. They're doing this. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. No, you. A good, good, good, good, good, good, good. And you're behind him like, fuck it, go! You have to go, nobody's ever gonna go. There are rules in place for this situation. You're not going to get into heaven for letting somebody go first in a four-way stop. Because I'm going to stab someone and that shit's going on. Your tab. Go, go, go, go, go, go. It's going to lead to, gaga, gaga, gaga. Listen, you guys, you cannot be nice with someone else's time. That is not how kindness works. If you want to be nice, join the Big Brother or the Big Sister Program and bring a kid to the movie. But on your way to the theater, fuck in, go. You have to go. Now I want you to know traffic is the only time I get real upset. That's true. I'm a pretty laid back guy. I love walking around and seeing other people get mad. I think that's fun. Because I am a hypocrite and I like to judge others. And that makes me feel good. If I see a man yelling at his kids, I'm like, oh, I'm so much better than him. And that gets me through my day even though it's not true. My favorite kind of anger is self-produced anger. We've all seen that. Guy at the grocery store is holding the door. Somebody walks in. Doesn't say thank you and the guy holding the door is like, welcome! Oh my god. Has anyone ever needed to hear Drive Safe don't rate more than him? Like ever. What does he think? Everyone's just at the gym running on the treadmill, getting in shape. Does your hope somebody holds the door to store today? Can now wait to say thank you. It's crazy. People have other things going on in their lives, right? Even if it's something as small as remembering your list. When you're walking through the parking lot. Just milk, eggs, flour, welcome! Okay. Alright. Yeah, that was most likely for me. Are you holding the door? You were, right? Yeah. I was just trying to remember my list. Yeah, welcome! Nobody likes getting yelled at. Especially in public. Nothing good has ever happened from that. A guy is never like, oh, I should take that guy fishing. It's always something like, oh, I'd kill him for sure. That's why I admire psychopaths a little bit. I think psychopaths have figured some things out. I do. A psychopath thinks, I'm gonna kill that guy, and then they just kill him. And the rest of the day they're like, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. They're just so happy that their to-do list is done. But a man that fears societies rules, you can't go killing people all willing, nearly? Well, I just like, oh, I'm gonna kill that guy. But, eh, I'm already at this store, I should probably just get my stuff. Yeah, I'll do that. And then he goes in the store. But he hasn't forgotten that he's been yelled at. So 10 minutes later, he's walking around the frozen food section just like, okay, hold on. What do you mean, I'm welcome? Why am I welcome? You're welcome. How about that? You put thought about that? How about you be welcome? I just opened this freezer door. Didn't need your help there. Did I? I got goers all day. Fuck, welcome. And he strokes out in the frozen food section. And he forgets his list. And he goes home without milk, eggs, or flour. And his only job all week was to make his little daughter a birthday cake. You assholes. I mean, seriously. Let's review all the things we've talked about tonight. And cake, just shut you down, huh? We've talked about so many topics. You're like, not the cake. Don't you dare. My God, you're so nice. Stop. The Lord is a Lavendenver. You hear those? Just as a reminder, a man had just stroked out in a grocery store and nobody had any problem with that at all. And then I mentioned a girl not getting cake and you're like, Oh, God, is there a bakery he could stop at? Stop it a bakery and get some cake. It's a birthday. I need you to know something. When I wrote this story, I never even thought about that little girl for more than one second. I just needed something to do with those ingredients. So I picked cake because I like cake. This little girl is just supposed to go, Hey guys, and then leave the story. That's it. She's like, one second in, one second out. And you guys are like, come here. We'll get you some cake. Come on. You come here right now. This story is about a man on the verge of a mental breakdown. I just picture this man in his kitchen stirring an empty bowl with dead eyes. Still has his hospital bracelet on from the stroke. Just mumbling things like, hold it up for me, hold it up, you. Do you need you? Hope does. Automat Do you? You were waving at the camera. Not at the camera. It's father-in-law walks in the kitchen. How's the cake coming? F**k it, welcome! That glueses his mind. And a whole bunch of you were like, is there frosting at the house? Is there frosting at the house? Can we get this kid some frosting? Which is crazy to me. Because the point of this entire story is this. When a woman is breastfeeding a child, and the child is sick, that illness is in the child's saliva. It enters the mother's body through the aereola. It travels around the mother's body. The mother's body fixes it. It puts it back in the milk. It sends the cure out through the nipple. Kid feels better. Our noses can categorize 50,000 smells. Our eyeballs can see 10 million different colors. That is the potential of the human body. And you can't figure out a four-way stop. I know I have had a lot of problems with humanity up here tonight. But I also want you to know I think I give you friends with almost anybody. I mean, the only group of people I can think of that I wouldn't be friends with is if we're walking down the street, and we overhear somebody say finger bang and you don't even giggle. Then I don't care to have you a part of my life as a part of my life. Or we're going to go to your house and drink gin and do accounting. No, thank you. If you're an adult and you hear finger bang and you don't even go, okay, or like nothing, that creeps me out. That's why I like talking to really old people. Like 95 years old or you can say whatever you want around them. They're just glad you're talking. You could say finger bang in front of a 95-year-old woman and she'd be like, I remember finger banging. I was finger by Abraham Lincoln's nephew. Also a tall man, huge hands. I remember he removed his riding glove and it was like a fistful of dicks. It was thrilling. President Lincoln once said, a house divided cannot stand. Well, neither could I. Do old people can say or do whatever? That's how old men ended up as the creepiest things on the planet. I can't wait to be that old. I cannot wait until my actions don't have consequences. I'm not going to throw shit at people or be weird when I'm swimming, but I still want to have fun. When comedy's done, I don't have hobbies, so I'm not going to whittle recorders out of wood and bring them to middle schools. I'm just going to sit at the bus stop and then I'm going to flick guys in the dick when they walk by. And I know comedy's supposed to be smarter than that, but I don't care. Flicking dicks is really funny to me. I'm just going to sit at the bus stop with a big coat on, but my arms not in the sleeves. Then I'm going to sneak attack out the zipper. Flack! What are you doing? Doesn't matter. I'm old. I'm going to call the cops. Go ahead and you need to ride home. They're not going to rest an old man for flicking dicks, right? It's probably not even in the book. Hey, yeah. We're down at the bus stop and we have a... We have a... There's an old guy down here flicking dicks and dude, it is outrageous. I don't know. He's killing people. It's crazy. I don't know if his right shoulder is made up of only fast twitch muscle fibers, but this guy's unreal. He's beating younger men to their crutches, and my God is it fun to watch. And you know my rule, if I laugh it's on my don't make an arrest. I'm just going to eat my lunch here and watch over. Because dicks are not protected by the law. And I am in no way saying they should be. I'm telling you straight up, they're not. You flick a lady in the tin. Well, pack your shit because you're going to jail. What? As it should be. But you could curb stomp. A guy's bare dick. In front of a cop. And the cop would be like, it's probably going to be a stomach ache. Get you guys later. Nobody cares about this. That's why sometimes when I hear women go, we want equality. I always just want to whisper, yeah, but not all of it. You don't want the curb stomping part. Just take the good stuff. Take the M&Ms out of the trail mix. Leave the raisins. Because if you have a quality across the board and you get the good stuff, you're going to have to do things you don't want to do. Start calling your shots when you play pool. Hold on. Hold on for one second. I saw some women react like I said you were bad at pool. Those words never came out of my mouth. I never said women are bad at pool. I said your cheaters. That's different. It's going to be no more this. Oops, I made it in the wrong pocket, but I'm cute and you want to fuck me. So it's still mater and still mater and still mater. That goes out the door with equal pay. Now you're going to have to buy your own drinks and they're 1750 a piece. You didn't even know that did you. Back in the line, yoga pants. It's a quality night. If we have true equality between men and women, we're going to be able to fist fight in the middle of the street. And I can tell you, I don't want to live in a world like that. Because I would lose to upwards of 45% of women. Sounds like a high number, but let's go through the groups. White trash ladies. Uh-huh. And lose to most of them. Because they're tricky. They've had to get out of some tight spots by thinking on their feet. A white trash lady will say something like, look at my tits! And when you do, they hit you with something real hard. Probably a glass ashtray. Every single kung fu movie, little Asian girl skipping to school. Old Asian guy walks around the corner, you're skipping is stupid. And she floats up into the air and murders him with face kicks. You're going to have to factor in all little Asian girls to that. Every single one of them. Because you don't know which ones can float. They don't put stickers on them. You're going to have to factor in all black women and start removing their earrings as they're moving towards you. Because I don't care what martial art you've trained in, gentlemen. That's going to be a loss on your record. If you make a black woman so upset with you for whatever bullshit you're doing and she pulls her earring off and goes, what? Just go, nothing, nothing, nothing! And you run. And you find shelter. And may I suggest a body of water. Now, some of you are going to be pretty surprised by this next part. Because a lot of you think, I think black people don't swim. And that's the craziest thing I've ever heard in my whole life. You can't think an entire group of people doesn't do one thing. That's ridiculous and how bad stuff starts. I know black people swim. I've seen black people swim. What I have never seen and no one has is a black woman that just got her hair done. Get it wet on purpose. That has not happened since the beginning of time. And black people were the first people. They've had more time. A black woman will fall you into a body of water but just up to her hair. And they should be like, nope. And back it on out. And then you just shredding water in the lake. Are you going to leave? I took the afternoon off to get my hair done. I have nowhere to be. I saw a black lady leave the hair salon one time. She looked up. It started raining on her hair. And she looked up into the sky and she goes, no. And it stopped raining. So, you know, still think Jesus is white? I know I talk a lot of crap about my son up here. But I do want you to know that he's a very respectful young man. And he is a smart, like, too smart maybe. And he has a very dry sense of humor to the point where you don't know if it's a joke or if you're going to get murdered. Right, you wake up the next day and you're like, there's funny, buddy. The job is like, funny joke. Oh my god, I'm alive. It's like that kind of sense of humor. We were walking down the street one day. It was my son and my daughter and I. And an Asian family was walking towards us and there were seven of them. And none of them were higher. I don't get it. There were seven of them? Is that like a weird thing to say? Ah, fucking legalized pot. Here's what happens. I don't have to say anything funny. You just present a fact and people were like, oh my god. Dad, you're not going to believe what happened to me. Oh my god, it was a funny thing. We were walking towards an Asian family. There were seven of them. None of them were higher than my chest. Now, does that mean I think all Asian people are short? No, of course not. I know Asian people are taller than me. I'm just telling you, these are the facts of this particular story. So the grandparents passed us and then the parents passed us and the children passed us. And my son slowed down and he looked at me and he goes, do you think Godzilla was just a normal sized lizard? And my daughter said, isn't that racist? And I said, we will figure that out when I'm done laughing. Because sometimes you just got a letter buck. I brought my son to a comedy festival in Nebraska. It was Johnny Carson's hometown. And I was always such a huge fan of Johnny Carson. I wanted to show my son some history. They have a museum there and everything. So we went there and we had a great time. And before the first show, we were in the green room. It was me, a couple of friends, my son. And then two comedians walked in that I had never met. So they didn't know me and they certainly didn't know my son. And so they thought he was a comedian. And they were like, how old are you? And they go, oh you think you're going to go out there and wow the adult crowd with your 18-year-old humor? Is that right? Is that what you're going to do? Sure. And they're going to live with your parents and somebody whisper to me. They go, are you going to help your son? And I was like, no, I sharpen this stick. I know how, folks. So the guy was just giving it to my son. And he's finally done on my kid goes, yeah, thank you very much for that. I really appreciate the advice. Do you mind if I say something I like about your act? And they go, let's go for it. He goes, I really like how you smile at the end of your jokes to let people know they're finished since the punchlines don't do the trick. Everybody's slowly looked at me. I was just like, daddy, raise you right! So cool. But that wasn't even my favorite. At the end of the week, there was a former Miss Nebraska there, just a lovely woman. She was like the town celebrity so nice. And she invited us all to her home to have a buffet at the end of the week. And so we got there. It was my friend Joe, my friend Phil, my son and myself. And we got there late. And there were no plates left. And Phil is from Canada. And I only tell you that to let you know that he doesn't care about others. So we walked in and there were no plates left at the buffet. And there were three plates on the kitchen wall. And Phil goes, can I use one of these? And she goes, no, you may not. And he goes, why not? And she started crying. And through tears, she told us this story about how her mom had left Europe with just 12 plates in the clothes on her back. And then she met the husband and they had four kids. And they all got three plates. And all four of those kids had three children of their own. So they were all going to get one plate. And Phil goes, is that it? And she goes, yes it is. And he goes, well I'm hungry, I'm going to get food. And he turned, but he had a backpack on. And it knocked a plate off of the wall. And it shattered. And the only thing you could hear in the kitchen, was the clock ticking. And this woman sobbing. And my son goes, God damn it Phil, now she's going to have to kill one of her kids. I mean come on. This lady went from crying to laughing. And she goes, oh I like you. And my son goes, enough to go to the kitchen. And she goes, oh I like you. And my son goes, enough to go to the kitchen. And my son goes, enough to let me pick which kid. It's just like a superhero who doesn't know how to use his powers yet. I'm flying, is that a wall smash? Thank you guys very much, I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You guys are the best. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hey tight, hang tight. I want to tell you one more story, you can sit back down if you'd like. What a weird way to ruin a standing ovation. When I was starting comedy, I had zero money. And so my son was about to be born. And so I called this booking agent and I go, hey man, is there any way you can give me any work at all? I just really need to make some money. And he goes, how about this week? And I go, that's not going to work because that is the week my son is going to be born and I need to be around for that. And he goes, well good luck because children ruin comedy careers. So I would like to introduce you to two people that beg to differ. This is my son Isaac, my daughter Olivia. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Pretty good, huh? Do you have anything to say? I just want to let you all know that I start my job on Monday. Anything? Anyone bring their passport? Kids do not ruin comedy careers. They make them. But more importantly, these two have just made my life a million times better. So I just wanted to tell you guys that because I know I pick on them a lot. But they are the best. And thank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you. You're burning as a pain. You're burning for pain. Don't leave me, don't give him to cheat. Let's play fair and not compete. Would you let me know that you hold my hand? Would you call it a loss? I wish me dead.

I fucking like that. And it shit's selling. I go back to the old days with the rappers. I'm gonna, you know, I'm into that shit, man. Because you're going to support them, support them always. Because these brothers working hard, they get staying out the street. Nah, because you know, I was in Atlanta. You know, and I saw MoD. Remember a couple of years ago, MoD was the shit. How you like me now? So I'm in Atlanta with a crisscross jacket on. Confused like a motherfucker, dude. I'm still gonna lose my hand. I will continue to support these brothers, y'all. I'm telling ya, I must be doing well. I'm at Micah Jackson. He wanted to meet me. Ya'll. That shit tripped me out. You know, I was like, airy brother in this motherfucker.

And these comics that come in out here, because you know we present all the best young comics out here, you know what I'm sayin'? So if anybody tell you they ain't out here, that's bullshit, cause these brothers are workin' hard for you. These are guys, you don't see on even that improv, or comic strip live, cause they don't want you to bleed out here. These motherfuckers head and night on the desk, yeah. This is where we as black comedians come together in your night as one. Yeah. On the motherfuckin' jet, yeah. We grab our dicks, we do everything. On the deaf jet. So y'all ready to have a good time? Yeah. Let me say it, huh? Yeah. Now loud it in that. Yeah. Yeah, what the fuck are talkin' about?
Alright, alright, man. Tell you right now, I'm still kind of mad, because I just got a divorce. My wife took half my money. I hated to break that 20. Sheesh. Sheesh. You know how this fell as you know? You try to protect your stuff, right? So when I got married, I said, she ain't taking my stuff. So I put all my stuff in my brother's name. Then he divorced. Now his wife's got half my shit. Now I'm gonna get married again. I want a wife. I want some kids, man. I don't have any kids. I'm getting old, you know? Mess around too long. I have adults and shit. I gotta give me some kids, man, you know. But I know don't, if you're gonna adopt, you better be cool, because those shows are tricky. You see them television shows come on late at night, and the lady's always crying. Please get little B's you here. He's just so lonely. He needs somebody to love him. And he's just so hungry, and you start breaking down like, oh, sheesh. He is kind of cute. I sure get him, and then they clinch it. And he can be used for just 39 cents a day. I'm like 39 cents. That's a deal. You get down there. I want one of those 39 cents kids. You got changed for a dollar. Can't feed no kid for 39 cents a day. I took the boy home. He ate up the whole house, man. Two weeks later, I'm on TV, please. Take him off my hands. Then you know what I said? I said, you know what? There's a lot of single women out there with children. They need a good man and a good father for their children. But ladies, you two touchy with them kids. Am I right, fellas? You know how they are? Hey, dope, dope. This is my son right here. And I want you to love him like he was your own. But you can't touch him. Can you feel us? I'll get how bad he are. You got to wait till the leader rule. Yeah, baby, yeah. Give me a glass of water, too. Yeah, thank you. It's such a waste, don't you? They come running out. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you hit my boy. He's mine. You tell me what he did. And I'll hand him. You keep your hands off of him. They wait till he's eight or nine years old. He's too big now. Now he's not. He want to help. Well, when you go in, he won't listen to me. He's just too grown. And he's a man. He's going to be firm. You better not touch him. Now they ain't going for it. I didn't know that pool of my belt off. Stand back. I handled it. Took my belt off, went into the room. I had to fight for my life, man. That kid was hitting me back. I said, your mother told you to sit down over here. But I know you didn't raise you. Go, fool. Don't do it. Hit me. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. You know, here comes Mom. Why are you hitting him? Because my gun was jammed, God. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE There. Oh, man. I like to stay here longer, but to tell you the truth, my underwear kicking my ass, I got to get out of here. They about to cut me in half. You know what happened? Let your... Let my lady go shopping for me. You know how this is, baby? I'll be back. I'm going to the mall. What you're going to get? Some underwear. Oh, I know a place. I always know some place to go, don't they? Always, she takes to this place. Some huge place. Draws are us or something. I don't know what the name of this joint is. She's running through the actual thing. Look at all the draws, baby. I told you. I told you find some draws. Look. Look, look at some of those. I said, what's that? Pequini breeze. They're so hot.

Put them on that. And you know what? You got to stand like this, man. I thought it was me, right? I get to a party full five-brother stand round four. Hey, where was that draws? Where else? I hear you, man. Hey, you guys been great. You guys take these. APPLAUSE
Calling in sick for work? That's some of the best acting work we have at doing our entire lives. I was writing on a sitcom last year. I needed a particular day off. You know that way you need a particular day off and you're like, I could ask for that day off. But if they don't give it to me, I'm still not going to be there that day. So I'm going to have to go with a call in sick. It's going to have to call. It's a burden. It's on your own personal calendar. I got a day I got a call in sick. That's the day I got to do my three day acting toilet day force. Because when I call in sick, I don't just call in sick on the call in sick day. I start acting sick around the office two days prior to the call in sick day. I'd say you have like it'll be like a few days before you're going to start pretending you sick. It's the work front that's going to hotel in this happen one time. Like I am when he's like, we're going to be alone on Sunday and I was going to call in sick Sunday. It's just going to be me and you on Sunday already took a look at the schedule. We're going to be getting slammed. So make sure you're ready. And my head I go to him yet. No, absolutely man. I'll be ready. I'm going to be ready. I'm going to be double ready. You have no idea how slammed you're going to be on Sunday. You feel bad but you can't tell him. He always want to be like, yeah, I just want you to prepare for the storm. I'm talking calling and sick on the phone. Well, that's what I do three days prior to the call in sick day. I start acting a little sick. Little things a little cough here and there. Normally I drink coffee but instead I have tea. Do a hard dip with the bag until someone sees and looks and let me see this. Somebody's like, you're drinking taping? I know you have coffee usually. I get it now. Some of my throat. I know. Some of it's going down. And scene. What time I was acting sick though? And the guy's like, well, man, you sound bad. You should probably go home. I think you're getting sick. I'm riding my head. I'm like, no, no, I'll be sick Wednesday. I'm fine today. Wednesday. Wednesday. I don't act much while I'm all really in movies and TV. I did a show once and a director apparently was at the show. He wanted to meet me in the green room. Like he's a fan of yours. He's a important guy. I had very little time. I couldn't even Google him. So I walked into meet the guy and he's like, hey, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Big fan of your work. That's what you say. That's what you say. He's like, thanks. Because I'm a real big fan of you when you're stuff and he goes, do you do any acting? A lot of acting. Like, what's the last thing I may have ever seen you act in? So he said, I just want to be like, hey, this room, two minutes ago. I said, I'm a fan of your work. I don't even know who you are. And you bought that. So we're good. I got it. I get out. I don't think because of your accent. That's why I don't really do a lot of acting. I don't mind. I mean, I have a very thick. Could you tell me, can you tell them from Kansas, sir? I don't mind ever my New York long island accent. It is what it is, baby. But let's be honest, you know, the minute you start talking with it, this accent. Nobody other thinks, oh, it is a genius. I wish I could lose the accent sometimes. That's all. Like, my wife and I went to get a mortgage on the house. We had to get a bank loan before we walked in. My wife goes, when we go in there, try not to sound old Gumbah. That was the note. Don't sound Gumbah. Right away the bank lady comes up. She's like, good afternoon. I'm like, hey, how you doing? Yeah, that's just a walk away to get some. My wife looks at me. How you doing? How you doing? Ah, what do you order in a Peshraway sandwich at a deli?
The unreachable remains inרך for the Oh, my God, that is so much. Austin Texas, how's it going? Lake Show, great to see you. Look at this. Look at how the spotlight follows me. I feel bad for the front roads, like the sun rising. Look at this. Hey, you're going to be a little bit more than you're going to be. You're going to be a little bit more than you're going to be. You're going to be a little bit more than you're going to be. You're going to be a little bit more than you're going to be. Yeah. Aaaaah! Again, yeah! But I'm in here! Just for you guys. Austin, Texas. Yeah. One of my favorite towns, I saw one of my favorite things about Austin, Texas. One of my favorite restaurants has one of my favorite signs, perhaps you've seen it. It's a barbecue joint, has a sign that says, T-E-E-F. I'm not making this up. No need, teeth, to eat our beef. That's a real sign. That exists. I walked past that. This is a weird town, guys. You have a whole foods that you can drink white wine in the middle of it. You also have a barbecue joint that caters to the teafless. It's a weird place. Guys walking around with a beer to be just like, I don't have teeth, but I love cow! Only problem though, these places don't cater to the no-tief wallet. They definitely have teeth having prices. You understand? A guy with no teeth goes in there. He probably doesn't have the coin to throw down for this premium barbecue. He's like, how do you accept our contact? Beat it, no teeth. Scram. I was recently home in Boston, Massachusetts. Where my mother, Irene, referred to the singer Selene Dion. Listen to me now. She referred to the singer Selene Dion as Selon Dijon. I honestly don't know why we're not all doing backflips right now. Selon Dijon was said to me in a room with Aaronet. I heard it, remembered it, and brought it to the show. That is a gift. I haven't even added anything. It's like a cat bringing a dead bird. It's a treasure. And it wasn't like this. It wasn't like Peter. Who's that singer, French Canadian? I don't know. Selon Dijon, I don't know. What's her name? I don't know. Selon, is that it? Selon Dijon? I don't know. It wasn't like that. Your father got me tickets to my favorite recording artist. Selon Dijon. Just an expensive mustard rinse of a performer. I love Selon. I hope she plays my favorite song from my favorite movie, Big Boat Iceberg. That's my favorite movie. Starting my favorite actor, Leonardo DiPizza Place. He is a dream. Here, there, under the stairs. I love the lyrics. None of those are the lyrics, Mom. So I don't know if you can tell by my overall vibe. I am a friendly fellow. Kind of guy that likes to get to the airport a couple hours early. Get a few white wines in me and start telling old people they still got it. I don't feel like I belong in comedy. People going out drinking slippery American cocktails, having sex after. I don't belong in the nightclub scene. Look at me. This face doesn't... How are you doing? Fix your tail light while you were sleeping. No charge. That's... I don't belong in a comedy club. I like to think that there are millions and millions of different universes. Each slightly different from the last and this universe. The one we're all in currently is the only one where I'm not a youth pastor. Does that resonate with you? I shouldn't be on a fancy stage right now. I should be in a carpeted gennasium with an acoustic guitar with a rainbow strap. Just like... Who wants to rap about the Lord? Let's do this. Let's get some testimony. Let's get some testimony. I love those Tessies, buddy. Break out those Tessies. But no one will tell me why that's funny. Yeah. Corny Guy. I always like doing something silly up top. I look at it like comedy stretching. Remind me to not take any of this too seriously. It's just a silly job. So I'd like to do Pierce up top if any of you are familiar with what a weird world. You guys know Pierce? Yes, we do. We're going to do Pierce. For those of you who don't know Pierce, I feel like expectations are getting up high. Go ahead and lower them. Nothing is about to happen. So this is it. This is my impression of a guy asking his friend Pierce to get beers for a party. Okay? Starts with a door opening. For no reason. Pierce! Pierce! Pierce! Pierce! Pierce! Get beers, Pierce! Pierce, get beers! And music Pierce. Pierce for Pierce! Pierce! Go to Pierce! Pierce, three cheers for Pierce! If you don't do that in the shower alone tomorrow, you're dead inside. That's how that works. Make up your own. Just be like, I haven't seen you in years, piers. Live your life. No one else is gonna tell you, too. We did an old one to do a new one. This is a new pierce. This is a guy. It's just as stupid. This is a guy telling his Latino friend that their soccer team finally broke their losing streak, okay? A guy telling his Latino friend that their soccer team finally broke their losing streak. One! We won one one! One! We won one! We finally won one one! Where were you when we won one one? We finally won one one! One is what we won one one is what we won. It was one to one for the longest time one, then we won one one. Penalty kicks. If that doesn't unlock the safe where you keep your joy, maybe loop up the dial a little bit. Just a little bit. For yourself. That's where we're having a good time. That's the worst thing to do when you're actually having a good time is to declare it. I'll do that all the time if I'm at a party and we are having a fun time. I'll go, oh man, fun with friends. Not anymore. You just ruined this. Actually teach you guys the worst thing you can say. Do you guys want to learn the worst thing you can say? I figured it out. If you're at a party and you actually are having a fun time, wait for there to be a lull in your little horseshoe of friends. Statistically every 11 minutes. Then just look at them and go, oh man, this party is McDonald's. I'm loving it. That's it. That's the worst thing you can say. Feel how you feel right now? Violated. That joke changes your core temperature. The feeling of hearing that joke is the feeling of getting hit in the face with a living lobster. That's what that joke feels like. Everyone falls for it. I don't care how smart you are. This party is McDonald's. What? What do you mean by that? What do you mean by that, sir? I'm loving it. Fuck you. Fuck you, sir. Everyone falls for it. You have this. This is a tool in your tool belt now. You didn't know you were going to leave better than you came. If you're on a date, you just don't give a shit about the date you knew right away. You're like, no. Sabotage the date. Wait for a while and just look at them and be like, oh man. This date is McDonald's. Then there's a timing to it. It's a three counter two dry swallows. They're gone. They're not there. When you come back. It's great to be in Austin. Last show I had was in Atlanta. A travel agent made a mistake and booked me in a bad part of Atlanta called Atlanta. That one is right over the plate. That one. That is a straight show business. I don't know if you can picture this friendly face fellow in a bad part of Atlanta. But I was just like, oh no. I don't know if you've ever been driving around a sketchy neighborhood and you do what I do and start telling yourself that it's you. That you're judging the neighborhood inappropriately. That's what I did. I was like, stop it. It's fine. It's different. I like it. It's just different. Thank you. What a vibrant community. Check cashing places. What a wonderful service. Those should be everywhere. Thank you very much. Oh, a cash for gold. Thank you so much. Finally a place to get rid of this goddamn chest of gold I have. For I be a pirate back from voyage. Thank you. I knew it was a bad area because I saw a pimp. It's 11 a.m. I saw a pimp. How do I know it was a pimp? Picture a pimp. You got it. Don't alter your first draft of pimp in the lease. I saw a man head to toe in a furry purple suit. A glass cane with a living squid in it. And Kung Lao's hat from Mortal Kombat. I saw a pimp. Like the idea of a man who went to a costume shop rented the pimp and then proceeded to actually pimp within it. And then never return it as is the pimp's way. Then I got to my hotel. I don't know if you're still playing the picture at game but it's not like a double tree. It's like in a band and building someone had spray painted the word hotel on. Two ease, put them wherever tickles you. I'm checking in behind three feet of bulletproof glass. I still think it's going to be a delightful stay. I'm asking what the Wi-Fi password is. What is it? It's hard to hear you through this protective casing. It stabbed me. How odd. There's an underscore stab underscore me. Thank you so much. Then it hits me. This has nothing to do with me or my perception of this area. This is a messed up area. I don't care who you are. You need to get the fuck out of this area. So I'm in the middle of the transaction. I didn't know what to say. I had my roller bag and I was just like, Never mind. I just rolled out. I'm in the parking lot. It's 11 a.m. It already looks like a bone thugs in harmony video. I don't want to go to the crossroads just yet. So this is the most cowardly, lamest, most pathetic thing I've ever done in my life. I got in my rental car, Kia Serrento. Already pretty lame. Terrified. No idea where I was. No idea where I needed to go. Turned on the GPS. Hand trembling. Just knew I needed to get far, far away from there. I was parked in Barnes and Noble. I feel some of you not sure if you can laugh at that joke. And I feel that same percentage filing that away as a viable option to get out of a sketchy neighborhood. It worked. I could have done Panera. I could have done Apple Store. 15 minutes later I had a scone. Do you understand? You're welcome. It's not my finest moment. I think I'm getting too comfortable swearing. I recently told my doctor that I don't really fuck with cheese. That's true. I was in a doctor's office in the morning. And he was like, tell me about your diet. I was like, pretty good. Don't really fuck with cheese. Maybe pump the brakes, old P.D. fans. Maybe pump the brakes. I'm a dumb man, though. I'm a dummy. I recently dropped a dog. Oh, that's okay. Here are the empathy noise. I didn't wound a dog. That would be crazy. If I was like, okay, she was going pretty good. What next? I killed a dog. You know, those things everyone loves. I ended one. I wouldn't tell you guys if I did that. I would save that for my serial killer journal. I would just like, could man be so sweet in it? Is that just me? That's the craziest thing about serial killers. Is the journaling? I understand killing some people. But who wants to go home like, big day? Take it easy, duty-houser. You killed a lot of people today. Take it easy. So I dropped a dog. I didn't know you can't. Did you know? Maybe there's one person I'm helping. You can't drop dogs. If you want to put a dog down, they're like little old people. They need help. They have arthritis and joints. Be gentle. You have to be gentle. If you want to put a dog down, you have to kneel as if before a king and lay it down. If there's mud, put your jacket down. They need our help. I was raised with cats. You can bowl a cat. Do you understand? You can't hurt a cat. They're infallible. They're like the Pope or a Pharaoh. You can't hurt a cat. You can pick up a cat anyway you want. You can grab a cat by the fat behind its neck. It'll yield to that move from its youth. Straight up with that look on its face like this is degrading us both. I'm six foot six. That's like a kitty cat skyscraper. I'll go as high as I want, give it a little bend to the knee, a hoist into the air. Cats cool, baby. He's unfazed. He doesn't even blink. Do cats blink? He doesn't even blink. Let's just do 13 kitty cats, summer salt, smoke a tiny cat cigarette. Land on all fours. He'll be like fuck yourself, I'm a cat. He'll disappear into a nearby shrub. You won't see him for two months. He'll be fine. He'll forge for himself. He'll come back on a rainy Thursday covered in low-main. Just like I've returned. Not because I like you, but because I choose to come back. That's how I like my love from women and from cats. I like to earn it. I like to earn it. When a cat meets you, he's like, die. And you work up to that per. That per means something. People like my dog loves me. I'm like, yeah, but your dog would also love a bag of sticks with your t-shirt on it. You know what I mean? Scram. But I love dogs. Don't get me wrong. I love dogs. If I see a dog, I love it. I get excited. I'm very tall. And especially, it was like a cat-sized dog. I want to pick it up. That's how I love animals. I want it close. Looks so small. Bring it up here. Where I can see it. It's always a gamble picking up a dog. I'm sure where they bend. It's never the same. Where do dogs bend? It's a gamble. They're like rigid little furry tables. You got to go in like a fork lift and just take a chance. Once you're up in the air, you never know when's it going to yield into that lower-case sea shape. With the asshole right on your arm. We all act like that's not happening. It's a lovely beast. The asshole is right on my arm. It's cooler than the rest of them. So I'm holding a dog. It's like a 35-pound dog, like a Boston Terrier or something. I took a picture with the dog. Proof that I love dogs. And then I was done. I'm done with the dog. I feel you judging me. I'm judging me too. This is a stupid story. This is a tale of woe. I'm done with the dog and an idiot me. I just open. From here, I just open my arms. And immediately I watched it falling. I was like, that doesn't look right. Because this fucking dog didn't put his paws out to cushion the blow. He put his paws to the side. Like a goddamn adrenaline junkie skydiver. Trying to get the most juice out of the run. His arms flailed like an old man, chewing mosquitoes at a company picnic. And then he greeted the earth with his face. Are you listening to me? He greeted the earth with his face. Do you know the sound of a dog crumbling into the earth? I do. It's terrible. It's like dropping a hairy baby. Everyone hates you. No redemption. You have no choices, though. You open your arms and drop a dog. It starts free-falling. You have two choices. One, let it go, which is what I did. The only other choice you have, I've thought about it, is to own it and be like, fuck your dog. Your dog is a racist. I've always hated your dog. So, I'm a single man. I am the only man up here. A single man. I've never really been single before. It's new. It's interesting. It's not because I'm so... Who the kid stopped getting it wet? You never offend yourself. I just offended myself. I can't stop getting it wet. Look, gross. It's not because of that. It's because for the past whatever decade I've been sexually active, I've never said that before. For the past decade that I've been sexually active, what am I showing you? A slideshow? 1950s high school? This is a penis. Okay, here we go. For my whole life, if I sleep with a girl I date her for a year and a half, that's how it works. She's not even aware of it. I'm like, I'm your boyfriend, that's how it works. And I thought I'd give that a break. I was like, let's see what happens if I'm a self-reliant man and I will be a single man. And I like it. It's a given a take. The give, you can do whatever you want. There's no little girl there to be like, fucking stop it. Knock her head. They're not there. You can be like, I'm going to shave with Miracle Web. You'll be surprised how far you get. You're just like, zesty, and it worked. Downside, I choke on my soup. I die alone. I'll tell you, there are things that I do now that I'm single that I've never done before in my life. For example, if I'm going out, and this is sad, if I'm going out to a party or a dance or something, ice cream social. Anywhere where I think there might be a girl, and I might meet a girl. I hear lore of people meeting girls and having sex with them. I was like, maybe for all pity. You know what I mean? So if I'm going out on a Friday night to a party, before I leave the house, I do stuff I never do. Like, I'll make my bed. I feel you getting uncomfortable. I'm uncomfortable too. I'll make my bed. Because I'm like, a girl might see this bed. It's got to look like the cover of a Crane Barrel catalog. I want to look real nice. Guys, I don't make my bed. I've never made my bed. What am I recovering alcoholic? I don't need structure. I sleep in the same swirl of top sheet as I mule kicked it off the evening before in a fever dream. I've never made my bed. I jump right back into that, like a caramel center in a Ben and Jerry's flavor. I call Lonely Man's dilemma. I've never once made a bed. I can't tell you what it feels like to be wafting up a top sheet. That I haven't moved in a millennium. Just like, maybe a special lady the night. Tucking it in, guessing. I don't know how to tuck it in. Like fancy, like a hotel. Spraying down for breeze. Hear the truth. No time for a wash. Spraying down some for breeze. This is awkward. If you're not laughing, you're not picturing a grown man alone. Just like, shh. Floral scented desperation all over the sheets. There's a lamp that I turn on, like a sex lamp. Mooliting. I'm so confused. Unless I think your girl's coming over. I can't use the overhead one. It's too dank. What is this surgery? Sex lamp. Clean up the toenails. This is true. The feed might make an appearance. Trim up the toenails, guys. Can't have the cold, click-clack of your feet on tile. Be a deal breaker. Just like, hi, I'm foghorned leghorn here to fornicate with you. He doesn't have sex. He's a cartoon bird. I can't tell you guys, I don't have the poetry of language to then tell you what it feels like. To come home, one in the morning, alone, see the crack of my bedroom door, see the lamp, smell the febries, and promptly master made a top of made bed. I can't. I'm just like, this was for someone else. Pretty generous girthmime at the end. That is a generous girthmime. Not even a joke. That's just investigative reporting on what happens in my life. I'm a straight man. I'm one of those straight guys. Some exceptions. I am completely gay for Ryan Gosling. That's true. Behold the correct response. In fact, any man not clapping and applauding at least in his heart is a goddamn liar. And I want to hit you in the face with an antique fan from the Orient until you admit it. You don't have to be gay to know that that is a gorgeous sexy beast. And he's everything that we want to be. I am gay for Gosling. That's right. I don't want to fuck him. That's not enough. That's just a little piece of me inside of him. I want to go all the way up in there and wear him like a puppet. Do you see that? I want to be Ryan Gosling. I'm getting orders from Ryan Gosling. I saw the movie Drive, changed my life. It's true. I saw it, I left the theater, I was like, oh, that's what I'll do to be cool. I just won't talk. I've done it. It totally works. I've been on a date and the girl's talking. I don't know what to say. Do a Gosling with you, man. Shout your mouth. Chew on a toothpick. Don't say shit. It works. And by works, I mean we're in a non-sexual relationship where I'm helping her raise her son. And also helping her husband rob a pawn shop. I think it'll be okay. Straight man are the most easily a fendable group. My group. It's fun to fuck with them. It's fun to mess with us guys. I love playing the price game with my friends. Never do that. That's where you talk to your friend. You're like, all right, I know. You're straight. You are a straight man. I believe you. You check the box marks straight. You are straight. Got it. $10 million. You go down on a dude? I don't care how gay friendly or open-minded the guy is. It's always the same. It's like, no. No. No way, bro. No way. 20 million. Barf city.org, bro. I'm logging on. $100 billion a week for the rest of your life. Not even considering it, bro. Seriously? How many Tahitian islands in polar bear butlers do you need to forget 15 minutes on a lonely Thursday? You'll move on. Do you know how much straight shit I've done? I've forgotten with two glasses of shardonnay and a Xanax. You'll erase the memory. You can even make it mythical. Like, dude, your mom is dying. We'll cure her if you do it. No way, bro. Modern raise no homo. Just in a rational monster they won't save her. You kill a guy for a million dollars? I kill a guy for 200 cash. stab him in the neck, watch life leave his face, but not make him feel pretty good. Listen to me carefully, Austin. I'm straight. That means I don't want to blow a dude. But it doesn't freak me out. Penis is don't freak me out. I'm attached to a penis. What do you think I'm in the shower? Like, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's back. I give a man a hand job most days. Me. I know the warm familiar grip of a penis you guys. I could figure it out. I'd be free-stylein, but I'd get the job done. Next thing you know, my mother's got every last thing life and I'm doing back flips into Goldcoin's DuckTales style. I'm so full of my ties I have no idea how I got there. Four. Four million. Are you kidding me? In a briefcase I can handcuff to my wrist? Yeah. Four million. Let's do this. You're fucking right. Four million dollars. That's Ryan Gosling, 50 bucks in a ride home. That's all right. And I give him the 50 bucks. Like, thank you very much. Big fan. Where do you live? This next one, I have no idea if it's going to work. This is a newer joke and I'm not sure if it's too mean. Because this is a weird feeling I've had. I'm a nice person. I'm a nice guy. I don't know. Just kind of like the kind of person you want to introduce to your parents. Like, I'm hanging out with this guy. Like, why? Nothing illegal. Hey. No pills or powders here. Hey, good looking. I'm a friendly guy. If your name's Anna, I'm calling you banana. That's the kind of guy. That's who we're dealing with. That's part A. Part B. Every girlfriend I've ever had, I've secretly hated her friends. Don't abandon me. Please don't betray me here. I know that's a weird thing. And some of you are on dates and you can't laugh. Fine. I'll be the whipping boy. This is a weird secret. I've had in every relationship. Thank you for nodding your head, sir. God love you. Every girlfriend. Why? Let me break it down for you. You meet a girl. What an exciting thing. You fall in love with a girl. And hey, she loves you too. How magical. That's great. You found a girl. And then suddenly there's just six fucking other girls. Like, hey, I'm Tiffany. Fucking be the Tiffany. I don't give a shit. I'm from Pennsylvania. Can I light you on fire? Is that something I can do? And my girlfriend always secretly hates her friends too. The second we're alone, she's like, I know Susie's a fucking bitch. I hate Susie. Susie walks in. Hey Susie. You hate Susie too. We both hate Susie. And my girlfriend is a girl. She's like, I know Susie's a fucking bitch. I hate Susie. Susie walks in. Hey Susie. And my girlfriend's parents too. Always hate him. I'm sorry. I know that's unpopular. It's weird. Always hate him. Why would I like him? You fallin' over the girl then there's just two random old people. Like, hello. How you doin'? Scram. You're in the way. What are we gonna hang out? Maybe we could all find a movie. We could all enjoy. Maybe we could ingest grenades. Is that something we can do? They want to get all friendly. Call me dad. Call me dad. I'm full up on dads. Already got a dad. And I've never been with my parents and been like, I gotta double up on this shit. Never. And they hate me too. It's just facade. They hate me too. We're all pretending to like each other. Go to cheesecake factory. Like, so Peter, what was your major in college? I fuck your daughter. Is that a major? I'm minored in. I'm rough with your baby angel. Is that? And we're gonna sit here like chums. If your dad's best friend fucked his daughter, hit kill that man with a shovel. But we're gonna split a dessert. It's a lot. I've been playing a lot of old school video games. I got an emulator from my computer. So I've been playing a lot of like double dragon. Yeah. Remember that? Streets of rage, two final fight. Been playing all these games. And I've been playing them and also cracking myself up with the following fantasy that I think would be fun for us to imagine together. The idea of a character from one of those side scrolling games going to the doctor? Already laughing. Because he's making artistic choices. It's a video game character like Hey Gar going to the doctor. How are you picturing it? Is it a human doctor? Maybe it's Dr. Mario. These are your artistic choices. But I can't stop laughing at the idea of Hey Gar going to the doctor. And the doctor being like, hey, Hey Gar, how you doing? Pretty good. And what do you even up to, man? What's been going on? I've been fighting. Doing a lot of fighting. What kind of fighting? Oh, regular. You know, left to right. A lot of little guys and then like at the end one big guy. Fighting, you know, pretty standard. Okay. And what's the problem? What brings you into the office here today? It's my stomach. Okay, why don't you tell me a little bit about your diet? I don't think that's it. All right, well humor me. Why don't you just tell me what you eat on a normal day? Okay, it's a waste of time. But like an apple. Like I'll find an apple. What do you mean you'll find an apple? You mean you'll go to the store and you'll select an apple? Is that what you mean? Oh, no. I'll be fighting. And then I'll hit a barrel. And that barrel will bounce a few times flash and disappear. You know, a barrel. And right there on the dirty ground, they'll be an apple. And I'll go over and I'll eat that in one bite. That'll get me about a third of the way. I forget who's who. You eat ground apples. Well, I don't call them ground apples, but yeah. You eat anything else? Oh yeah. Fully cooked rotisserie chickens. It's the stupidest joke there's ever been. And it takes like six minutes. You were here for something. Something happened. And that. Oh, God. Let's see how weird we can get it. This is a weird one. I've been thinking about breast milk a lot lately. Breast milk. Hey guys, breast milk. When's the last time you thought about that? Never. Milk from breasts. Guys, listen to me. Women can make milk from scratch. Milk. The shit you buy in the back of the grocery store. Women can make it with their bodies. I feel you backing away. I'm not a crazy person out on the sidewalk. Like, you can make half and half with your tahtas. This is a scientific fact that we must all reckon with. Any woman in this room can get pregnant. And something in your body goes, turn it on. And you eat it, quiznos. And your body takes the nutrients from quiznos. Turned it into milk. Something comes out of your vagina. You feed it that. And it lives. Holy shit. That's amazing. What's even crazier is I drank it. You drank it. You drank it. You fucking sociopaths. You drank it and you loved it. Oh my god, you loved it. You were never so happy spooning your mom's huge taht. Napping mid-guzzle. Listen to the truth. You would cry and scream and well when you didn't get it. And the only thing that would settle you down is going to second base with your mother. Do you realize you should be so much more fucked up than you are? I can't believe any of us are wearing pants. Great job, you guys. Way to turn it around. We should all be dressed like Abraham Lincoln right now killing off 2D clowns. That's where we should be. Not even clowns in makeup just like, I know you're a clown. And when the police get there, be like, sorry, I committed a thirsty act of incest that be like, as you were, Mr. President. Thanks for not killing all of us. This is the end of the show. I feel like we should talk about religion. Way to wrap it up. You guys have been amazing, by the way. Really, really great. I've been thinking about how I want to die. We all have to die. Weird if there was one person here that didn't know that. Like, what? No! I've been thinking about how I want to die. I want to get hit by an arrow. Who's hit by arrows anymore? That never happens. I want to get hit by an arrow. And not like in the woods where it would kind of make sense. I want to be waiting for like a crosswalk to change just like, what? And you know if one hits you three more on the way, just like, who the fuck is arching me right now? I would crumble to the earth with a smile on my face. That would be the best way to die. I thought about the funniest way to die. It's me. I've been hit, hopefully, by arrows. God willing. And on the ground, I'm dying. And somebody's passing by and they see me dying and they come and they kneel beside me to be with me in my final moment. I'm written social rule. That's what you're supposed to do. So, they kneel beside me and I see this man. And I get a second wind and I lean up and I go, not today. But then I just die anyway. To lean up with vigor and declare like, not today, I guess today, then you fall back down and diarrhea shoots down one of your legs. And they put not today on your appetite because you can't argue, you're gone. It's weird that none of us know what happens when we die. That is a huge burden. That all of us share. I don't care if you're an atheist or a big time believer, either way I respect you, all of us, in common, no idea what happens when we die. It's all just a guess. That's crazy. It's wild. We just walk around acting like we're not thinking about it. Like, in fucking yogurt shops. It's like, hi. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is it all by weight? Is that how this works? Like the crunchies and the candies and the fruities. Those are all, it's all by weight. Where did grandma go? It's a heavy question and I'm tired of not talking about it. The way I see it, you have two choices. You can believe in something and be that variety of doofus or believe in nothing and be that variety of doofus. Either way, you're a doofus. You got to choose. You can believe and be happy, yellow t-shirt, just like, yeah! I know. It doesn't quite add up, but I love it. It just works for me. It works for me. This is a segue. You're hauling ass on a segue. You throw a wet, nerf football to a golden retriever that catches it as the sun is setting and you're like, that's proof of the Lord. That's choice A. Choice B. You can wear a dusty corduroy jacket with elbow patches and scotch, bring everyone out of party down with your science. We're all bags of water and electricity. We're going to die. Those are your choices. And they exclude each other. Everybody thinks they're in between. You got to choose. You got to choose right now. Why not be weird? Choose it a comedy show. Which are you? Everybody thinks they're in between. You got to pick one. Which is it? You're on a plane. It's going down right now. Which guy are you? Are you science guy in first class with a scotch? She's like, well. This is as meaningless as it all was. Or the believer back in coach just like, I'm going home. You put it that way. It sounds obvious. Of course, you would be a believer. But it's not always better to be a believer. Because chances are, if you believe in something, you probably think that thing has a preference on how you live your life. That's where science guy wins. Nothing's judging him. He's like, what about it? I love dog pornography. Who cares? I look at it every night. I'm carbon. They're carbon. It makes me hard. I jerk off. I go to bed. He's fine with it. Or you can be a believer, mostly happy, but a closet at home is sexual and burn yourself with a cigarette every time you get a half-boner from Ryan Gosling. Those are your choices. And I'm 33. You think I would have put this to bed already? I would have had it all figured out. But I can't because things keep happening that make me question it, man. Like, for example, recently, a guy jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge to die. Obviously, not to celebrate life. Not like, things are great to high. It wasn't like that. He jumped off to die. And in the air, mid-fall, the guy realized that he didn't want to die, called out to God. And when he hit the water, listen to what I'm about to tell you. When he hit the water and the order, are you listening? You know that animal? No one ever thinks about it. You know that animal? No one ever thinks about it. And the order, swam up, push the man out of the water and saved his life. That man said that that order was sent by God. Was it? I don't know. I got both interpretations in my brain. I got science guy going, yeah, right. That order probably thought the guys' feet were fish. That order killed a human baby later that very day. But I want to believe in that world where God is up in heaven. And he goes, someone's falling, order. And the order goes, God it. And God is up in heaven. And I picture the Burger King King. That's my God. You can have your God. I got my God. He's got the unmoving, smiling face, the crown, the wopper junior up there watching. Just like, you want to live? Have it your way. I want to believe in that so very badly. I spend most of my life believing in that variety of God. I know I still have some religion clacking around in my subconscious. You know, like when you shake a spray paint bottle and you just, that's what I have of religion still kicking around in there. I know that because I'm still afraid of raptures. Is anyone here afraid of raptures? I will make fun of you. Someone went, no. Do you say a little? Oh, Jesus. I heard a no from this. That would be a great time for the devil to hackle. Like, no. I feel like if you're not laughing, you're not picturing a red devil in a Carmen San Diego trench code with the fedora. Just like, no, continue your wicked ways, everyone. I'm afraid of raptures. I'm a grown man. I'm afraid of raptures. Remember a couple years ago, a couple people, like big group of people put up all those billboards that said the world was going to end Sunday at 6 o'clock? I'm the only person that was terrified by that. I got home on that Sunday, it was 4 o'clock and I remembered. And I was like, shit. Two hours. I don't even have time to watch fours come. What do you do? I was afraid the world was going to end by the Lord, you guys. So I didn't know what to do. I had to bottle a scotch that someone gave me as a gift. And I was like, listen to the thoughts of a rational man. I was like, if the world's going to end, I'm going to try this scotch first. And I did, it was great. That's a weird ad. Weird ad for bush mills. I was like, afraid the world's going to end by the Lord? Bush mills. So I drank the scotch. And the scotch worked. It made me forget that the world was going to end. And then I'm laying on the couch and now it's just another lazy Sunday. No, no, I'm not proud of this part of the story. But I was going. I'm a grown man. I'm not proud of this. Occasionally to recreate, I will take myself on a J-Date. Do you understand? I was going to take myself to dinner. I was about to begin. I'm not very sexy with myself. I'm like, you ready to begin? I'm like, yeah, begin. I want an H.J. from Lesbian, Val Kilmer. Get in there, girl. I was about to begin. And this is how I know I still have some religion. Click, click, and around back there. Because I looked up at the clock and it was 558. And I went, nice try, the devil. No fucking way. No way, am I going to have my ham and my sandwich when Jesus comes out of the fucking clouds on a flaming sheep. Just like, oh, what are you doing? I hope that feels like heaven, because you'll never know. Hosanna! Hosanna! Sorry. For some reason, I love to pretend that Jesus is tone deaf. And it never does in crack me up. I feel like if you're not laughing, you're not picture dying and going to heaven. And there's Jesus as you've always pictured him. And he's like, wow, come! Welcome to paradise! You want a fucking tell the king and kings? He can't carry a tune? No one wants to tell him. Go tell the prince a piece. He needs to work on his harmony. Blah! Playing the harp. Blah! He can do anything, just not much of an ear for music. Tone deaf, Jesus. Okay, the show's basically over. Oh, thanks, man. That was one of the best moments of my life. This is good, but it's hard to remember everything. I'm aware of the cameras. And there's this quiet moment. Weirdos are the best fucking fans in the world. I'm not just pandering. Listen to what just happened. It's silent, and I'm kind of like, okay, there's a couple things we could do. And then we'll do the last thing. And as I'm thinking about it, this gentleman right there, what's your name? Jonathan Flann. Of course it's John. We went to school together. Jesus. Fancy. He went to Gordon College, my weird Christian college. Now weird. It was weird. Now look at us. So in the middle of the show, Jonathan fucking flanders. He's looking good. You look like he lost some weight, kind of got it together. You know what I mean? You run into someone from college. You're like, why are you man now? That's what happened to Jonathan Flanners. It's dead silent. He just goes, this show is McDonald's. And then I turn. And as people I know from fucking college. This is like my order moment. I'm like, he is there, my God. I'm up here like, tone deaf. Jesus, blast for me. It's fun. Hey Pete, remember New Testament? Yes. Blast for me, it's fun. I like to mix up which Jesus I blaspheme. Mormon Jesus, that's a good one. He doesn't get enough. Fuck Mormon Jesus, like in traffic, it's fun. It's okay, I feel all your assholes tightening up in unison. No. Isn't that weird? It's like the only other time that happens is on an airplane. You know where there's a big bump? Everyone's asshole. That's the only response we have. Your body is pathetic. And it's like, we might die. We can't grow wings, tighten the asshole. That's the only time that happened. We could do it now. On three. No one will know if you do it or don't. This is just a treasure for you. And some of you, this is the only thing you'll remember. And in unison but clenched for no fucking reason. Other than we're living our lives and caching happy checks. Ready? One, you better do it. You're gonna get anywhere to go. I swear to fuck. Somehow I'll know, two. You're kind of getting ready. You didn't know you knew there was a way to get ready. Some of you kind of widened a little bit. Three. I did it. We did it. Good for you. I think it's weird that electric eels exist. Those are real. They're not like unicorns. They're real. Electric. Electric eels. Eels that have electricity in them are a real thing. They're swimming in the ocean. Currently. With currents. That's happening. That's insane. When's the last time you thought about that? Kind of garden? Someone just came up to you and was like, hey, electric eels are a thing. And you were just like, I believe you. I'm gonna file that under T for true. And never open the file. Imagine having that open of a mind. That would be like if you were at the aquarium tomorrow. And I just came up to you and I was like, hey, you know, seahorses transmit a Wi-Fi signal. Just immediately. You're like, what's the password? Magical. It's magical. It's working. Come on. He swam away. I also think it's weird that we have a berry called boys in berry. Boys in berry, guys. You know we name the berries. Human men and women get together and name berries. You don't just like lean into them real close and they whisper like, I am a strawberry. It's not how it works. We get together and we decide the names. And one of the names we decided on is boys in berry. Guys, there's a lot of people who are like, boys in berry. Guys, there's two varieties of berries that I'm aware of, regular and poison. We named one of the regular berries boys in berry. That is one sound away from a horrible camping accident. Just like, how is camping with dad? He thought I said boys in. We're orphans now. You can't add B to a word and have it be okay. Who wants band-thracks, berry pancakes, delicious, fresh band-thracks from the male? You guys want to hear my dirtiest joke? We're almost done. It's not even that dirty. It's just like a fun dad dirty joke. It's like we're in a barbecue and I'm like, come over here away from the ladies. This is my fresco. Come on. It's more of an idea. I'm terrified of getting a girl pregnant. I think it's crazy that that's something you can do. Guys, that's something you can do. Depending on how you choose your day, the events in your day, you can either eat an egg McMuffin or blow a baby up somebody. Are you listening to me? It's like a choose your own adventure. One page has a low-cost breakfast. The other there's a baby that's like, I'm yours forever. That's insane. That's what makes me think. I think one of the reasons why guys enjoy pornography is there's no way. Nobody's getting pregnant. Not only are you not involved, but the people in the video never get pregnant either. Because it's always like, come on my elbows. Come birds. Man. And I think in the back of your mind, .com was taken. In the back of your mind, you're like, that's hot and responsible. But that's crazy. Because the point of sex evolutionarily is to make a baby. But that never happens in pornography. That's crazy. That'd be like someone inviting someone over their house. You want to come over on Saturday and make a cake? I love making cake. Well, come over on Saturday. We'll make a cake together. I love it. I love that you call it cake day. See you Saturday for cake day. Thanks for thinking of me. And then they come over on Saturday. And you're like, you ready to make a cake? Yeah. You get a big bowl. You start mixing up the ingredients, the milk, and the eggs, and the cream. You whisk them up real nice. And then you get the last second instead of sliding it in there. You just throw it in their face. She's like, boom! Nobody's getting pregnant today. Look in the camera and say bang bros. Look in that camera. And say bang bros. Cupcake edition. Okay, let's head back over to the ladies. Let's go back to the party. You guys have been truly wonderful. This is the last thing I will say. Now I just leave. This will be the last thing I say. And I really. My favorite thing to talk about, we save it for the end. People always get mad about tell marketers. I don't understand why. Whenever I go home and we get a tell marketer during dinner or whatever, my dad will answer the phone and be like, God, stop! God, stop! Tell them, I'm trying to eat my corn. Hangs up so mad, vain and his neck. Guys, listen to me. Tell marketers are a gift from the Lord. Do you understand it's an opportunity for joy in your life. Listen to what I'm about to tell you. They can't hang out. Do you feel that? That's the feeling of your life getting better right now. If you don't swear or threaten them, it's their job to listen to whatever you have to say. What an opportunity. I do it all the time. This is a true story. I answered my phone. I saw on the caller ID that it was a tell marketer. I decided to have a little fun. Cash them happy checks. Live my life. I answered the phone and I went, hello! I feel some of you wanting that to be funnier. But this is a true story. And remember, no one was even there with me. I was like, this is going to be great. Hello! I was like, hi, is Peter Holmes there? I'm like, this is she. I'm in the bathtub. Scribbing up, dub. Scribbing up, dub. I'm downstairs. Say whatever you want. Should I swallow it? Press one! Anything you want. Because like, well, I'm calling from Chase Bank. I'm like, um! Money, money, money! To the money song for ten minutes, not a real song. Then I said the word diarrhea, 20 times in a row. Guys, I'm 33, the age of the Lord. I said diarrhea 20 times in a row. Never the same way twice. Just listening to a nose breath on the other end, waiting for his turn to speak. Finally, I run out of wind. I can't say diarrhea any longer. And the guy gets a chance to talk and he's like, well, Mrs. Holmes. I'm calling to let you know that your credit card has been stolen. This is a true story. What do you do? I couldn't stop the voice on a dime. I had to like, slowly work my way out of the voice over ten minutes. I was like, oh no! Did they buy anything? Expense over! What do we do? Do we put a hold on that account? Is that what we... Do we put a freeze on those funds? Thank you so much for the early alert chase. I cannot afford to have this happening right now. Thank you sincerely. Goodbye! I said thank you so much everybody! This was incredible! Thank you so much for being here. He's a crispy everybody. Thank you! Thank you very much. Good night! Thank you very much. Good night! Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

From these long city from these central presents D-ray! You can start now You can stop, you can stop now, don't you feel? I'ma let y'all know something on front to say in a comedy show, this is a get together. So I want y'all to get comfortable. Don't feel like you had no everybody at home, sit down, relax. This is, I wanna apologize like I always do for not having jokes. This is my life. And it's messed up. Why the hell I gotta have a garbage can on my set? Why the black man gotta have a garbage can? So things to stop for black people. Certain jobs, black people don't trust black people with. Don't lie. If you at home tell you this is the D-Ray way, check it, I'm telling you. So things we do not trust black people with. Black valet. Hey, to see this right now, when I ain't giving them my keys, I'll pull up. He's standing on the cheers and there's your car. How long are you gonna be? Hell no. Hey Pedro, come here Pedro, come here. A black life guard. Hell no. Tell the truth. You go to the 10 beats and you see a black life guard. He's sitting there chilling, he got timidly his own. He can't even dive and save you right. He got a dive all sexy, I got him. Good job. Third things we just can't do. Like black men, certain things we can't do. Like being relationships. It's not for us, it's just not for, I do not want to be in a relationship. Women crazy man. Women are crazy. I don't know, women clap, you know you nuts. Look, they sitting next to a crazy woman out of you, you don't want to speak. I'm just the sand. Women don't like broke men. Hell, we don't like men broke. I think it's our choice to be broke. I live in Los Angeles, I hang with the richest people in America. And they treat me like hell. I hang with ball players, you have a hung with a basketball player. They make you feel like you ain't nothing. They call me, hey, let's call D-Ray. So you can make us laugh while we shopping. Now I'm at the mall following around telling jokes. They buying stuff, they not even looking at it. Give me that, give me that, ask me if I want something like a bitch. And you want some, mmm. Some jeans. I hope you don't think this means nothing. Women are hard on the broke man. Like the first day trick y'all do. Women got a first day trick they do. Whenever the bill comes, you ever had a woman do this? They reach in the purse and pretend they're looking for money. So they want you to say, no, okay. Hell no, I let that ass look. Did you find it? Because I'ma need that hat. I can't do it. I can't do it. I just don't want to, I can't do it. It's the D-Ray way, I just can't do it. It's my way of thinking, my life is who I am. Like gas, gas got to them high. So the broke man, we fall out. I can't be in relationship gas to them high. I can't come get you. It's too expensive not updating in the community. If I could walk to you, it's gonna last forever. Women put too much pressure on us, man. Like women, women control the clubs. The clubs are set up for rich men and women. And they set up for the broke brother. Like in eight two lines when you walk in, they're like, broke, rich. No, you just caught up in it. And women make you feel like dirt in the club. What is it about the club that make men just shriek? You ever try to grab women? How many women are tired of men reaching for them? Like they grab you. How many women are tired of getting grabbed in the club? Well, turn around when we call your ass thing. You see this? Hey, hey girl, hey, hey girl, hey, hey girl. See women have different ways of going out than men. Like a woman won't let her woman leave the, won't let none of her girlfriends leave the house and am messed up outfit. Hell no, they can't. They give it then. They see a girlfriend coming out and says, what's wrong, you don't want to go? You can just tell us you don't want to go. It's okay. But not men hell, no. We don't give it then. What off-friar got on? We want them to look bad. So we look better than him. He's like, how does it look? It looks good. He run down to the car. Watch what he got on, man. Got a socks pulled over his jeans. I'm not sure if he's going to be able to get it. He's like, how does it look good? He runs down to the car. Watch what he got on, man. Got a socks pulled over his jeans. It's all a weight, man. We treat stuff totally different. Like, men go to the club, women go to the club. Women go to the club to actually have a good time sometimes. Women go to the club is for them. Dance you have had the four women dance in the circle. They dance about a seven and a little circle. Why is it always a guy? I feel like that's his circle. We could walk. Hey. You know what I mean? Wait, no, me, have you. They go to have a good time. And if women are out and they have a girlfriend that single, they look out for that girlfriend. They say, girl, you know what? You don't have a man tonight. We're going to find you a nice guy. Not a boyfriend because the girl is like, I don't want a new man. I don't want a new man. I'm just trying to live. No, we understand. We're just going to find you. I got six sisters. Let me tell you, I heard all this. I just try. I don't want a boyfriend. I don't want a new man. No, no, no. We're going to find somebody who's just chill. Just comfortable, okay? It's real cool, okay? And they can, okay. All right. And if a guy walks past and they like that guy, the girlfriend's all agree. He's nice. One of the girlfriends will walk up to him and say, I'm going to go talk to him. No, no, don't do that. I'm going to go talk to him. I'm going to hook y'all up. I just want you out of me, okay? So she walks over to the guy. She talks to the guy. Now, if that guy comes on to that girlfriend and in the kind of way, the woman gets mad. Hey, how you doing? My girlfriend Shirley is so nice. And I just want you to come. What? Who me? Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. But it's not about me. My girlfriend, who? What? My look? I'm trying to tell you about somebody. No, what? My number? Look. You know what? You a ass. She don't need you anyway. You looking at me already? Girl, forget him. When I was young, I wanted to commit suicide. I did. I wanted to kill myself. My mother was on drugs since I was like eight. I was like, it got to be something better than this. So I tried to kill myself. It don't work, man. I'm still here. I tried, man. I tried to take a lot of pills. I tried to take a whole lot of pills, and Mr. Riner took 20 Flintstone vitamins. I was up for 17 days. I was up for 17 days. I was, what? When am I going to die? I tried to smother myself with a pillow that don't work, man. I couldn't breathe. That's what I wanted. I was like, what do you want to do? That's amazing. I'm fascinated by it sometimes. I'm like, you ever wanted to just die, just to see people? Just to talk to them. Just die to go and say, hey, I'm going to go back in a little while. This is cool. Nah, man. That's crazy. What if you could pick the day you died? What day would you pick? Never. The only thing you want to die? You're in the plane. You were playing the plane going out, you're like, God, not now what if God was like, didn't win? Yeah, I don't know Tuesday. I'm a die. Death is horrible, man. The main reason I don't want to die, because I don't want to put my family in charge of my funeral. I don't think they come to a good job. My family, chief, is there up from the streets of Chicago? I mean, they would put me in a damn car. I wouldn't have a cask of death having a damn refrigerator. They cheap, man. Plus, I want to plan my own funeral. I want to plan my own funeral, because that one, I want to make it live. I want my funeral to be off the hook. I want it to be like a party. I had flyers out live there, D-Ray. Ladies free before 11 a.m. I have a cracket. Had a bounce up there. People be on the list trying to get in. On the back of my old bitchy wary, it's going to be a different old bitchyware. On the back of my old bitchyware, I'm going to have pictures of all the women I slept with, saying goodbye right. You know what I mean? The old bitchy wary. Old bitches wary. Your bitchy will be on the back. I'm all way out. Another reason I don't want that too soon, is I don't really know when the caskets are boring. In the caskets you just land there, people could walk up, play with your lips, lift your eyes up, D-Ray. I don't know caskets. I want to mess people up in my funeral. I want you to walk in. I want to be propped up in my eyes open. That'll mess you up. You walk in my funeral, I'm like this. On the rotator point, that'll. Oh, man, that does amazing, man. Do you think animals think about death? Because I wanted to like in the street. I wanted to do. Do you think animals think about death like, man, today might be my last day getting walked? Because I know it's wrong, but I laugh at Roe Kill. I do. I laugh at Roe Kill. Because I think you don't see them other animals landing in the street. What make an animal look in the street and say, hey, that might be cool. And it's messed up. Because you see a dog laying there, you're like, oh, you see a cat landing like, oh, and I killed a cat before. I did. I was driving home from a comedy club in Chicago, and I was riding in my cousin. We were rapping in the car. You know what you're doing? Ain't nobody around. We rapping to each other. Yeah, yeah, I'm, yeah, yeah. We shooting a video in the rear of your mirror. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, you do all y'all didn't shot a video at home by your damn self. So we were hiding and I, I had to fill a little bump. It's small. I was like, boom. And he said, hey, I think you hit that cat. And I said, I see a cat. We rode back around and shooting up. I had to hit the cat. And I felt bad. I was like, damn, because the cat was beautiful. I knew it belonged to somebody. So I pulled off like a crime scene. I was like, damn, I killed him. It was like, when those horror movies, I was like, I can't believe I did that. As I was driving, I started feeling tougher. Like I had did some, you know, did some gangster, you know what I'm saying? I was driving. I was like, shouldn't have been in the damn street. Can't? So now I'm out of the club, feeling like I'm tougher than I am. I'm at the club. I'm looking at me. I'm like, what you looking at? I killed cats. But the dumbest thing I ever seen, I seen a bird get hit by a car. As a bird, how do you get hit by a car? I started thinking. It was a black bird. She went off with some girlbirds. Hey, hey, hey, watch this dip, dawg. Watch this dip. Look. And I like, I don't know, man. My preference, I like dark-ass women. I like black-ass. I don't know if it's because I'm light-skinned. It's just the deray way. I love black-ass, dawg. I want a girl so dark, when I turn the light off, I don't know what the hell she ain't. She just run past and do freaky stuff to me. Pfft. Pfft. Pfft. No, your head dark-heat-sheet. Pfft. Man, women put you through too much stress, and women y'all know y'all do that. Stop stressing the man. Stop talking about absolutely nothing sometimes. I don't care. You could be mad at me. I'm cool. Women talk about nothing. I wish women could run out of words like cell phone minutes. Right in the middle of an argument. And another thing. Ah-ha. I'ma talk to you on nights and weekends. I get a woman. A woman, man, I mean, get him. But get him. Women get mad, quick, man. A lot of men don't know how to cheat. You know why your woman catch you cheating? Huh? You want to know? Because you don't do it the deray way. Your woman catch you cheating because there's a change in your trends. That's how your woman see. That's how your man needs to know. Your woman knows you. She knows you inside and out. So if you do anything different, see, this how your woman knows you. Like this. So you do anything to you. I see that. I see that. I see that. That's why when you start the relationship, mess her mind up. Start like this. That way she never know what you're going to do. See a lot of men don't know how to do that. You got to make your woman think you're crazy. If a woman thinks you're crazy, and I don't mean crazy, like domestic violence crazy, crazy, like something is wrong with you crazy. She would never question you because she don't think nobody want your crazy ass. Make a woman think you nuts. Wake up in the morning, just have your head between the mattress. She goes like, baby, what's wrong? Did they call? Did who called? Just walk out the room. Wait till the stars raining outside and go wash your car. Baby, what's wrong? Did they call? Before you know your woman go think you're so crazy, she don't want to get embarrassed. She'll be like, yeah, they called. Just come in. Just come in. They on the phone right now. You're saying you're crazy, ass-ing. You got to pin proof your house, man. Do it the D-Ray way. A lot of men come on, you get caught because you take a shower. You're woman like, oh, hell no. What you taking shower for? Nah, hell no, man. You need to learn how to D-Ray way your house. When you come in, take a shower. When you wake up in the morning, take a shower. You eat some cereal, take a shower. Play the video again, take a shower. Take out the garbage. I feel dirty, take a shower. That way, when you come in and fives and the one's like, why you taking a shower? Bitch, I always take shower. Ladies, I'm a bond with you on this. It's sometimes our fault that we don't know how to come home right. You know why? Because we don't pin proof our house. You have to pin proof it. Make it comfortable for you to come home. See, when you leave, never give yourself a curfew. Men, we have a bad habit of doing that. Your woman acts like sneaky little nice way. So when you're going to be back, don't fall for that. Tell her like a movie. Just coming soon, leave out. LAUGHTER Because you tell a woman the time. You tell a woman the time you come home? Women lock you to that time. Am I telling the truth, ladies? Because you feel like, right? He said it, right? You asked him. You say, what time you going to be home? And men say, uh, about two. So now, two is in their minds. Two hits all the walls of the house. Two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two. Now you come home late. Now you messed up. You coming in the house late. Any man who has a sneak in their own damn house? You pull up to your house, you looking damn. LAUGHTER It ain't that we're scared of you. We just don't want to hear your damn mouth. LAUGHTER And nobody here want to break up. Nobody. I don't want to break up. I can't do it. Because breaking up, you wonder why you get stalked women? Huh? Because you try to leave our ass. And we don't know what to do. Now we lost. We're going to go. That's why you get stalked. We're not stalking you to find out what you're doing. We stalk you to ask you, where should I be right now? LAUGHTER Don't stop me. He's following me. Don't stop me. Don't, don't, don't. Another reason we stalk your ass, and this ain't part. This is my, I just need to get this out. The reason we stalk you, because you leave us and you get with another man, and you do everything the first week for him. You should've defied ass the last f***ed damn six months. She get with a new man she doing everything, having sex, every kind of cooking at the same time. LAUGHTER I hate that. She get with a new brother doing everything for him. That's why I pull a trick on. I derail well. I wait three weeks just in new relationship. I just pull off a mask. Yeah, I'm the new dude too. You been with me the whole time. Because I don't, I just don't, I'm telling you. I have a problem with breaking up, because I don't want, I have a nightmares of going out and having old game. Y'all know what I'm talking about? Like the wife, you're like, what, what is game? I mean, game like, go out and have the same lines I had from when I first met her. So all the young cats that came in with the new game and now I'm out saying old stuff. Hey, how you doing, Miss Lady? Miss Lady, baby girl, baby, talk to each other. Got my, I don't want to be that dude. I know a lot of y'all like, what the hell is he talking about? The D-Ray way? Yeah, it might not be the right way. But hell, try it. You got to do it the D-Ray way. Peele proof your house, man. A lot of men don't know like, and this is, I'm gonna give you guys this lesson. When you, if you do want to come home late, go to an acting class because women are tired of your lives. Women have seen the same lives. How many women is sick of the lives? Sick of your man coming home. He always had to drop somebody off or do something else. That's why he's laid or he got an argument. And he was in the club and the bounces wouldn't let him leave. You got to make your woman feel bad. You got to pin proof your house. Make your woman feel bad that you come in late. Make her feel messed up. I come in late. I know she's standing there, man. I come in, man. I come in slam the door. She's like, where have you? I can't believe they tried to shoot at me and walk away. Who tried to shoot at you? Who tried to kill my baby? I don't know. But I'm gonna go out every night this week until I find it. Do it the D-Ray way. And the last thing I'm gonna tell women, if you have a good man, if you believe in your heart, you have a good man. And a good man does not mean that he doesn't see other women. A good man means he comes home. Because some men don't. Stay out of his things. Women love to search through men's things. It's none of your business. You search for things. You hurt yourselves. Why? Don't search and hurt yourself. You looking for stuff. Like women love to read your text messages. Stay the hell out of a man's text message. And men sometimes it's your fault too, because you didn't do it the D-Ray way. You didn't pin proof your house. Before you go to sleep, this is what I do. I send myself a text. That way when she opened it, it's me. Close my damn phone. Before I wake up, and we are D-Ray, peace out. Cheers to the stage. The power of gold. The power of gold is good. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.
I'm gonna talk about Magic Johnson. I think Magic's a hell of a man to come on TV and say what he had to say. He got a lot of heart. And deal with a smile on his face. I feel good. I feel good. Life goes on. I'm gonna beat this. Because if that had been me, I'd have came on. You're looking at dead men. I got five six years tops. I'm robbing banks. I'm assassinating the president. I ain't got shit to lose. Because 91 was a trip. 91 was a year. Everybody went crazy. Police lost state motherfucking mind. I know y'all seen the Rhine and King beaten Camo every night turning to a TV series. Let's watch the Rhine and King beaten tonight. 738-39. Third of a rule. Whooping his ass just for you. And they fucked the brother up. And now let's get ready to go to trial to police keep coming on TV. We're not guilty. Stevie Wonder can see these motherfuckers guilty. But that's all right. Because the brother getting paid. He getting a million dollars for every blow. 56 million dollars. I'm looking to get fucked up. I'm doing 300 miles an hour in a Volkswagen. Yelling out to window. Fuck the police. Fuck all your bad dreams motherfuckers. Come over here. Whoop my ass, give me my cash. If I know I'm getting a million dollars for every blow, I will grab the billy club and fuck my own shit up. Then you hear clanshtomers and Anita Hill. Black on black crime at the highest level. And I think both of them was telling the truth. Because clanshtomers and pants so many asses, you just forgot about that one. Because you know clanshtomers and pants that ass. You married two white woman, no ass at home. That's good. He showed up at the job scene at Big Fat Black Juicy ass. Fuck! Welcome to the job, baby. You ever seen long-done silver? And the real hypocrite was the senators. Your biggest crooks in the world are fit trying to jail somebody. Especially take candy's eggs. Greatest mirrorer. Drive-by student, you name it, he done it. And they finally asked him a question. I, you old disintegrate Casimbaugh. Just don't bring up none of my shit. Oh, yeah. And I found out that a lot of our nation's great four fathers were heavy cocaine users. Like Alexander Graham Bell? That's how you got his middle name. Graham! He like the vibe by the Graham. Because you gotta be totally high and out your mind to come up with a concept like telephone sending home. I wish I could talk to somebody any minute. Hello? Hello? And you know Ben Franklin was fucked up. He went out to lighten the storm with a kite. Me and I say more. And Michael Jackson got his new album out. The stuff Teddy did on this slamming, the rest of this... I think Michael's on crack. Myself. Anybody that will fuck they face up like that on purpose, he doing something. I bet you might as well go home, might as well. Oh! Oh! Good night, Jack.
All right, it gives me great pleasure to bring this man up here ladies and gentlemen Joe list Thank you Thank you, that's very nice Thanks You got it cool. I cuz no one's gonna believe it on YouTube. That's the problem Every comment's gonna be like fake audience You didn't clap at all. I appreciate that, you know, that's what I like I got a big sign with my name. I'm in the back feeling like hey, well the fuck what's up? And then I look and you're like no, I don't care about this guy It's perfect puts me right where I need to be for the big show The sign was a mistake I blew it with the sign It's too big I Didn't realize how big it was I mean this is an outrage Okay, can be with this I Thought it was gonna be like a little like Joe list Well luckily only cost $25,000 so I'm breaking even because of this monstrosity, but Thanks for coming guys. This is very exciting. Yeah, oh, thank you. Appreciate it. You're so nice You're lovely Thank you No masks in the crowd maybe a couple no I Support either whatever you guys do I support it. That's my mass dance That was my mass dance all the way through whatever people did I would just do whatever the people around me We're doing and then I would make fun of the other group of people That's how I handle things I'd meet up with friends. They have masks on I'd wear my mask and like I saw some alt-right fucking assholes with no masks I'm not a meal my other friends. They're not wearing masks. I wouldn't wear mine. I'm like I saw some cut liberal sheep over there with their masks Believe these buses I just want everyone to like me. That's my stance on everything is real abortion. Whatever you guys think I think the exact same thing agree with all of you individually You're all correct Like a vaccinated unless you didn't that I didn't either Stupid idiots They'll be dead in no time I did I got vaccinated and I was fine. I guess whatever I don't like getting shots. I'm afraid of needles I got I'm not afraid I don't know I just don't like getting a shot and I told the lady I was like I don't do well with needles so just go easy. She's like what happens? Are you gonna hit me or? Like what? People hitting you Maybe I'll hit you shit. I didn't know that was an option. I Had not crossed my mind to hit you But now that it's out there maybe go easy And I was like no, I'm not gonna hit you she's like well what happens are you gonna faint? And I was like you know what just put me down for a regular just Somewhere between psycho and pussy just a normal. I was just making small talk. I wanted to say something before we did it What Happens I'm gonna be like oh shit That's like worst case scenario. Eee Just normal That you gave me the shot I punched right took a nap just cuz I didn't want to let him down You know I don't want to be uneventful I Co-op was fine like when we started to first come out after the like the lockdown and then you'd meet up with your friends Kind of feel them out see who's been taking it serious Do you guys do that like I meet up with a group of friends and I got like one friend and he's like He's like I haven't left my house in like six weeks. I'm like, oh that seems weird And then I have another friend. He's like I wear the mask indoors, but not outdoors and I'm like that's fair And then I have another friend. He's like I fucked 48 women in three days and like oh That Seems a little risky at any time period you gotta be careful out there, but I Hope everyone gets the vaccine not cuz I care about public health I just want them to stop talking about the vaccine on the news because every time they talk about the vaccine They feel the need to show a needle going into somebody's arm on the TV They're like we gave a one million vaccines and look at it Wow And they get like multiple hang like four in a row just different angles of like a needle going in and I find it appalling It's disgusting My friends can tell me like you got a needle phobia. I'm like I guess I got a needle phobia. I didn't think I did I Just don't like I'm not walking around like a needle. Oh I just don't like watching them go into people Like I'm not afraid of bananas, but if I turned on the news and they were shoving a banana into a guy I would be like I fucking hate bananas right now That's not a perfect analogy, but I feel like it's decent I think it's weird that you could show a needle going into somebody's arm on television, but you can't show breasts Like a needle is vulgar breasts are natural No one agrees, but here's my point My point is they should show tits when they talk about the vaccine. I think that would be Should be like everyone's now eligible for the vaccine the lady comes out like Everybody who me vaccinated the whole country will be all over Even the most skeptical guy would be like all right. Oh, yeah, you got me. I'll go get a vaccine. That seems His friends like you idiot what about the government? He's like yeah, I might see some tears. I want to see some tips and Everybody likes breasts, you know, right? No, maybe not I Love him. I feel like about that my mother's funeral and somebody took their breasts out I'd be like that's a little inappropriate, but I appreciate it very much Thank you. That's really sweet of you. She put those away, but then looking out I Love him. I have a wife and she has breasts and she know I'm serious It does and she's so sweet. She's very liberal with him. She lets me see if she knows how much I love them So she'll like at the end of the day. I guess it feels nice to take your broth at the end of the day She'll be like honey. I'm taking my broth and I come running in like a puppy I sit on the floor and I make eye contact with both of them And maybe think like if I had breasts I feel like I'd be showing them off all the time Maybe not I don't know what's like to be a woman. I don't mean like drunkenly like whoo I mean like earnestly like in the morning at the bank or like Starbucks Where in line and the guy in front of me is like what's the matter? He's like yeah, it's just a long line I'm like hey check this out. How do you like that? Huh? And he's like what oh my god, I'm like, I know sweat and joy It's fun I'm not telling how to live your life. I'm just saying you could be doing more for your community if you wanted to ladies Traffic slap on the window, you know lift some spirits Sometimes though my wife. She'll wear a shirt that she's gonna sleep in so she doesn't take her shirt up She takes her brought off like through her sleeve. You ever see that like a lady should pull her broth through the sleeve That's like the meanest magic trick ever She's like ta-da I'm like boo That trick sucks It's like if you want to see a magician he pulled the rabbit over hat, but then you didn't see tits, you know what I mean? That's not a great analogy there my analogies need work, but I saw an ad for a bra store here in New York. I don't know the name of it, but you could probably google it It said it was like it was smaller than this actually, but Billboard it said we have 90 sizes of bras I was like settle that seems like a lot of their 90 breast sizes. I Guess there are I only know four breast sizes. I know tiny medium huge and yucky those were four breast sizes There's probably more than that, but it's less than 90 right? I don't mean to be offensive penis is same four sizes Those are the dick sizes also. There's like that's too small. That's regular. That's huge. What's going on with your dick? Sir you are It looks painful that's swollen Sex is fun. I like Rest and six I Look smart. I look like I've gonna have like intellectual stuff on the mora. Sorry I feel like I come I've like glasses and I'm like I'm like what's up with tips and there's plenty of shit jokes coming also I Thought about naming this special shit dick and tits, but Like the algorithm wouldn't I like all those things I don't like I don't watch porn though, which nobody believes ever No, you're saying no right off the bat. It's very hurtful. I tell people like I don't really watch porn like now you do I'm like all right I was telling my buddy. He's like a like a religious guy. He's like a spiritual fellow I think it's like a good guy. So I was like I don't really watch porn. He was like that's stupid. I'll send you some shit I was like oh, that's That's not what I was going for It's like a moral reason by the way. I'm not better than you like I'm a piece of shit I just they don't have what I'm looking for in porn Like my friend was like they have literally anything you can imagine and I was like they actually don't you know why because I can imagine myself having sex That's what I'm into that's my thing. I like me Having sex that's my fetish and there's no porn with me in it You can search all day. You're not gonna find any Joe Liss porn You type in Joe Liss has sex with a cast of friends nothing comes up Look at this I can just imagine it. I'm blowing Chandler right now. I can do whatever I want I Occasionally what I'll do. I'll try to find a porn that has a guy in it who looks like me to kind of like root for you know what I mean Like a video game. We create your own character It's hard to do though. There's not a lot of guys that look like me in porn There are but it's not going great for them If you see a guy that looks like me in porn he's tied up and someone's fucking his wife right in front of him. That's the look That's my porn look I'm like hey that guy looks like me. I hit play and he's like honey. No Putting lipstick on him and a shoe in his ass hole and I'm like hey, what the hell? Get that off of me I like that I have a wife too and we have like we have sex which is nice. We have like a healthy sex life So that's like another reason I don't need porn and we have sex a lot I like a little dirty talk during sex. We've been together for like 10 years So I like a little dirty talk, but she's not great at it. She's good. But what she does She throws out too much dirty talk at once. Have you ever had that with a partner? We're having sex. She's like yeah, you're so good. I'm all wet. You got great penmanship. Your dad loves you I'm like just do one of the ones I gave you don't read the whole list Those are suggestions not a script Just pick one and riff on it I always want to have sex but sometimes my wife doesn't want to which is fair of course But I don't like the rejection. So what I do this is a good move. I don't know if you guys do this I'll ask and then she says no I pretend I was kidding. Do you guys do that ever? It's like a pretty good move I'm like we should have sex. She's like I don't feel like it. I'm like well not now What You thought of it right now It's hilarious You thought right now in the middle of the afternoon I wanted to have an orgasm inside your body. That is you're wacky I was thinking later What do you think like six seven minutes because I'm pretty I want to I don't have kids my wife and I we thought about having kids during the pandemic But then the pandemic sort of ended and we were like no that's stupid. Let's not do that. Did anybody We were at home. We were like wouldn't it be fun if we had a kid running around but then restaurants open We're like well, let's go out to eat. That seems a little easier Save a few bucks Here's the thing if you're gonna have a kid I feel like you got to have like missionary sex just like regular. I love you sex Cuz I like to get a little nasty and bet you don't want to get too nasty And then you have a kid and anytime you look at your kid you're like ah shit that was crazy Is that how it works? I don't know I just picture like look at our son running all over the football field remember that night you stuck your middle finger to my asshole That was insane Look at our beautiful daughter graduating from high school remember that night you punched me in the face You call me a homo because that's what I needed to have an orgasm Cuz we had been together for way too long when we decided to finally have children. That was really something else I My wife is sweet sometimes I feel like she doesn't even know me though I was on the road recently and I couldn't sleep. I had anxiety so I called her at home And I was like I'm having trouble sleeping and she's so sweet. She was like have you tried masturbating? I was like that is adorable that you thought that I hadn't thought to masturbate I'm like no, I thought I'm masturbating. I thought I'm masturbating way before I thought of calling you That was that was several activities ago And I don't mean that offensively that's the first thing I think of when anything goes wrong We lose power in my house. I'm like let me masturbate real quick. I feel like that night spring something loose I lose my phone my friends like why don't you call them like let me jerk off. I think that I might remember I think my wife's attracted me it's hard to say I do I do mixed martial arts MMA anybody doing that Now I'll fucking kill everybody in here. Keep the shit in you guys If I wanted to you see it very nice but I do MMA my wife loves it. She's like turned on first of all I thought I was gonna learn like hand-to-hand combat. I learned dick to butt choker and that's That's cool too, but I Wanted to learn self-defense. I learned I'm attracted to men and Those are both good things to learn My friend was a you should do MMA find out what you're capable of I am capable of maintaining an erection while a guy strangles me from behind How would I have known that otherwise you know what I mean you've got to step out of your comfort zone occasionally I'm kidding a little bit, but It does feel oddly sexual the sport I show up. I take my shoes off. I give my buddy 50 bucks We roll around. I'm like this feels a little fetishy He's like we got to work on your mouth today. I know we hear a mountain. I'm like all right. I feel like I'm getting duped but My wife loves it though. She's like turned on. She's like oh my god. You're fighting. That's so cool She's like that's hot. I'm like you got that right She's never seen me do it though. I can't have let her see me do it. That's the issue I think she thinks I'm like stand there fighting a guy and reality. I'm just laying on the ground I guys pulling my arm and I'm like okay, okay, oh I don't picture my wife watching that and being like oh look at the way he quits right away I love the way my husband gives up immediately What a smaller man gets his arm You can just tap that's the best part of the sport you tap the other person they have to stop legally they win, but you don't die Sort of a win-win I think we should have that socially you know you're like a party or a bar and someone's telling you a shitty story And you're like you know what I think I'm done with this actually you're taping the forehead And then you're like no no you won that was great And your friends like why'd you tap so early like I was gonna kill myself like I've listened to that piece of shit story So I had to get out of there I want to be tough. That's why I do have a man. I want to be like a guy that's like secretly tough You know what I mean that like looks like me, you know, but like in kickass you ever see those guys Like you're at a party and someone's like you see that guy over there You can't tell my look at him that guy could kill you, you know, and I'm just like I want to be one of those guys. I'm more a guy like this I'm like at a party and people like you can't tell my like look at that guy But that guy is very good at softball you would really be depressed That joke never works, but I just want you guys to know that I'm very good at softball. I think that's important I know I don't have a tough look because my first day at MMA we went over striking That's like punching and kicking you pussy's probably out for no other kind of shit, but We went over striking my instructor said when you throw a punch you want to turn your wrist like you're pouring tea And I was like I feel like you don't say that to everybody somehow Pretty sure he just looked at me. It was like you've probably poured tea. Is that something you've done? I was like oh yeah, you shit me. I love tea. That's like my favorite beverage I My first punch was terrible. I had my pinky out to my elbow flare I'll never see one fire the guys like you want some camo meal bitch, huh? How about some jasmine? Every time we spar I say you're in steep trouble and I laugh and he gets mad Pretty cute is like you got to stop doing that I'm like well whatever you brought it to tea thing I'm trying to have a nice time here I want to be tough I started doing MMA. I got inspired. I was watching Larry now you guys remember Larry Nasser He was like the serial child. Well, this is not gonna be a pro Larry Nasser take not a way I'm not gonna be like that guy was all right No, he sucks. He's in jail now. He was like the gymnastics guy. He's in jail But remember the trial there was like a big trial for him and it was on the news and during the trial One of the victims her father stood up and he said your honor. Can I have five minutes alone with this demon? You guys remember that right? I think I was gonna beat the shit out of Larry Nasser the judge said no You're not allowed to do that The judge is like you may not But the dad didn't give up. He said how about one minute alone He tried negotiating that was the best part like the judge is gonna be like all right one minute come on Get these tables out of here. He asked twice come on hit the clock Get him Said no again. That's not part of the judicial system unfortunately But it inspired me because I was like I want to be like this dad and I'm not a dad at all But I was like I want to be like that guy taking matters into his own hands. It's gonna beat the shit out of Larry Nasser I was like I got to learn how to fight though because I don't know how to fight I couldn't do that if I was in his position And I was like can I get five minutes alone with this piece of shit and the judges like you got it I'd have to be like wait what oh shit I just want to impress my wife. I don't want to fight the guy I Because you can't lose that fight You can't be like let me get five minutes alone with this son of a bitch and come out five minutes later with two black eyes and a bloody nose crying And be like you're on a can I get three more minutes to two friends is that possible? How about one minute a weapon I want to teach the son of a non-unilessing I think if you have kids you got to be able to fight a little bit Don't you think protect your kids, you know? Yeah, you're saying yes, right? I don't want to tell a little kid my next door neighbor He was my age we were like seven or eight years old or whatever and then there was like a neighborhood bully And he beat up my neighbor and the kid that got beat up He was all beat up and shit and then his dad came home and the dad was so upset that his son had been beat up He went and confronted the bullies dad and then the bullies dad beat the shit out of this kids dad Like father and son beat up on the same day Brutal I felt so bad for both of them. I felt really bad though for the mother slash wife Because she had a compilment her husband and son have like ice packs on their heads And she's like what the hell happened they're like no time to explain We need you to fuck up Mrs. Reynolds right now come on This family is dominating us mom We need you Kick off those heels and kick some ass god damn it I do like kids. I like I have nieces and nephews and they're really fun I like them they call me fungal Joe and it's really sweet It's adorable Not even like as a joke they're like really earnest like hey fungal Joe. What did you have to eat today? And I kill two with them you guys are like you guys are laughing with these kids I pull my thumbs off and I'm like Kill sometimes I pretend to walk downstairs when there's not stairs there. I'll be like I'm going down It's better if there's a coach you guys aren't seeing the full effect I did it reach I'm getting old though. I did it recently and I fell down the stairs I was like oh I'm going to go fuck my knee gave out And if you didn't even get it he's like I'll go Joe's drinking again. I'm like shut up and get help They're fun here's some kid I don't have a kid but here's some advice from someone without a kid You can't hit your kids anymore people get very upset if you hit your kids But you know what you can't do you can throw your kids into a swimming pool as hard as you possibly can Nobody says shit I know that because I was at a hotel pool recently and this little kid went up to his dad He was like dad throwing the pool and the dad was like you got it son And then the dad's whole face changed He grabbed his son by one rest he was like He just whipped him He almost cleared the pool I had to step in I'm a good guy I like kids I had to be like hey sir I'm not going to tell you how to live your life But if you get low you might be able to skip him kind of just shoot him right across the fourth try I was in a hotel pool recently and as I was in that story so I guess twice twice recently A lot I was in hotel pools every week I Want to be the only guy in the hotel pool if you guys ever had that happen you probably have like families and shit or whatever but It's the best you're like a hotel pool. It's a huge pool. You feel like a millionaire. It's exciting I splash around and shit. I'm like Frederick. Bring me my pool toys Just to have fun, you know I was in the hotel that somebody else came in which is always a weird moment where you're in the hotel pool alone And then somebody else walks in you're like excuse me can I help you hello? Oh, this is public. Okay, I got you And a lady walked in she had a kid with her like a whatever age this is like uh you carry it like this and it said shit. I guess Two or three or whatever and then she got in the pool with the kid and then the kid looked at me And then she looked at her mother and she said I don't like that man One of the most hurtful experiences of my life Because I wasn't like splashing her given the finger. It was just my face that she was like nah, I don't like that And I want to be like I don't like you. How about that? Nobody like like six people like you and they're obligated to I got 70,000 Twitter followers you've done bitch. How do you like that? Yeah Yeah Let's see you sell out the village underground with a giant sign But you paid for with your own money Also, you don't need a pool you like a foot tall go take a bath you asshole. What are you doing down here? This is for adults I Didn't say any of that of course I put my head down and just left she bullied me out of the pool They should have you know they should have is like a like the hotel room should have like a monitor that lets you know who's in the pool You can't have that. I just realized people would be jerking off from the monitor I just as I said it. I was like that's no good women could never swim again, but they should have like a color coded system Because sometimes you go down to the pool and I'm traveling by myself a lot So I'll go down there. I went down recently. It was like a bachelor party in the pool And I got to swim with these bro's they're gonna like hold my head into water and piss on me or something So I got to like leave, but pretend I didn't want to swim I'm like do you guys know what the business center is? I have a towel and orange shorts on I got to check my email. That's why I came down here with flip flops on I do like kids. I was uh, no sometimes it gets weird with like other people's kids I was on the subway recently and it was like it's getting crowded again And it was really crowded and we were all piling on it was a little kid next to me And he kept stepping on my foot like three or four times he stepped on my foot and finally after like four times I said excuse me little buddy. You're stepping on my shoe and then his mother went um, he's a kid I was like yes, I know that That's why I said excuse me little buddy I And not hey get the fuck off my shoe asshole I feel like I was handling that as though he was a little kid was that not Oh, he's a little kid. I didn't realize that get on both feet. I'll walk you down the steps I thought he was a drunken little person trying to fight me. That's why I got so aggressive I almost choked him out. I'm so happy you stepped in I hated that kid and his mother I hated it possible. I don't want to be one of these guys that gets older and is like back in my day Whatever but when I was a kid if I stepped in a guy's foot and the guy yelled at me my mother would be like do you want to hit my son? Go ahead hit my child take his shoes I was on the subway recently there was a lady sitting across from me And we were just like mining our own business and she pulled a recent peanut butter cup out of her bag And then she started opening it and then right as she finished opening it She fumbled it and she dropped it on the floor of the set now Don't jump ahead everybody She didn't need it. She picked it up and she went oh And then she threw it back in her bag and she went She looked right at me and she was like this And I was like I'm sorry you doing that for me. I don't know why you get to see that. I don't care if you eat that I don't know why we're making eye contact. I'm not comfortable But she kept doing that she's like Oh Then we got to the next stop and she got off the train. I kept an eye on her because I was fascinated by this lady So I watched her she got off the train and I watched her get right back on the same train But one car up and right away. I was like I think I know what's going on I'm kind of watching it through the little window and sure enough she just pulled it back out. She's just aided on that Which I love I was like good for you enjoy yourself find a new crowd. They don't know I like that lady. I like that lady because that lady is me. I'm the woman in this story I just wanted to kind of feel you guys out to see how you'd respond Some of you judge me you can't take it back but many of you supported and I appreciate it First of all, I blew it off. I'm not an animal. I gave it a good and I brushed it You can eat food off the ground you guys know that nobody's ever died that way No one's ever been like my nephew passed away and you're like what? How He dropped the three musketeers bar on the floor He picked it up and ate it blood shot out of his eyes and ears He shit his pants and died It was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life We should about a Dyson we had a goddamn dirt to hold suck I was at the a lot of times comedy is very isolated I guess I'm always in hotel pools by myself. It's a very isolating profession I was at the mall of America a couple years ago and they have a roller coaster at the mall of America Now I wanted to ride the roller coaster. I'm a fun guy you guys can see that obviously I want to ride the roller coaster, but I was by myself. I feel like oh weird. Oh, I'm like I don't want to ride a roller coaster alone But then I was like whatever that's just my anxiety getting the way of a good time So I said you know what I'll have one ticket for the roller coaster now the roller coaster seats four across So when you're by yourself they put you the group of three and my group of three was like three 10-year-old boys They're like here with these kids And right away, I'm like I don't want to sit with somebody's children. I feel like a weirdo alone now. I feel like a real weirdo with some of these kids But I had to go through with it. You can't back out in that moment You can't be like oh, I can't sit with kids never mind. Forget it. Sorry That's like a red flag. They're gonna be like what's up with this guy Why can't he sit with children So I had to be like sure You can't go too big either by the way you can't be like yeah You got to split the difference. Yes, I would love to So So the next time with the kids and you're about a roller coaster they're like right next to you I like our legs are touching we're like right here and I'm like should I say hello? She'll be like hey, what's up guys? All right There's that like a stranger danger. I don't want to freak them out But then it also feels psychotic to just stare straight ahead So once again, I had to split the difference so I kissed the cutest one in the lips came a little Nothing serious just soft. I don't know a good guy, you know It was weird because the cutest one wasn't next to me. That was like a piece of shit next to you. I don't lean across him He got jealous That part's a joke I gotta make it clear that this is I did not kiss the child But the story really happened. I really did ride a roller coaster with three kids at the mall of America And then there was a lady over here. She started waving like this now. I'm an idiot You guys are probably like oh, I bet she's like the mother of one of these kids that is correct I'm a tibsian. I thought she was a fan. So I started waving bad. I was like hey I'm just like you I was like oh, that's your child. Oh, that's your kid. Okay. I see. That's why you're both horrified. I've got you. I'm bad I had to ride the roller coaster. I didn't even enjoy it because I was so anxious Like it off the roller coaster. They're trying to sell you a photo. They take a photo of you on the roller coaster. They're trying to sell it to you Would you like to buy a photo of your experience? I was like you know what? I think I'm gonna pass on the photo Feels a little inappropriate. I'm like yeah, I'm gonna date by 10 of me and the boys Give any wallet sizes. I want to remember these children forever I want to remember these kids I met a few minutes ago for a long time I didn't buy the photo, but they got in line. They had a great time. So they bought the photo. I'm not joking This is a true story Right now there's a photo of me and three children somewhere in America It sort of motivates me professionally. I think it'll be fun of someday my career just explode I don't know if it's tonight, but someday The career just takes off and that family's at home watching a movie and they're like What the fucking guy from the roller coaster? What? Haha that lonely nerd from the mall He didn't kill himself He's talking to Tom Hanks right now That would be fun right God you scared me I thought you were coming at me I thought you were the father holy shit I just saw a movie but you were like in a fucking form tackle I was like oh my god That'd be a great ending you just smash me into the sign Well that's fucking ending rule Anyways Oh my throats kill me I got reflux Rooney I guess like that there was a fair spiel reference Think that in Anytime anyone clears their throat, Rooney Like to have a word with you by God Uh, that's a great film anyways I've asked a reflux I had to get an endoscopy Do you guys ever get one of those as a fun? That's when they put you to sleep for a few minutes Then they put a camera down your throat and into your stomach and they look around to see if you have $3,000 that they can take it's pretty cool To find procedure And again to the docks could be and the doctor he's like I we're gonna put you to sleep for a little bit He's like we're gonna use a propa fall and I said okay, and he said don't get nervous. I know propa fall is a bad reputation And I was like I don't know anything about propa fall Not with me it doesn't And he was like oh it's the drug that killed Michael Jackson It's like nice Do me a big favor give me a little less than you gave Michael Jackson if you don't mind I would love to sleep for a shorter period of time than mj And here's just a little tip you don't have to tell people you killed someone with the drug you're about to give them I don't know Maybe you do I don't know He said it's a great drug he goes it'll put you to sleep in less than 10 seconds You'll wake up you'll feel buzzed for about a half hour after that you'll feel completely refreshed And I was like are you trying to sell me propa fall right now? Sounds unbelievable They don't sell it you're gonna steal it, but it's a great drug He gave it to me Went right to sleep woke up felt buzzed little free laps exciting and the doctor came over He brought me photos of the inside of my body He's like these are for your records And I was like I don't have records I'm a regular person I thought you kept the records I don't even have a cabinet I don't know what I'm gonna do with these I don't need these have you seen photos of the inside of your body they look like wet vaginas every single photo looks like a wet vagina So much so I don't even think he looked inside my body I think he knocked me out Google image wet vaginas Printed the results handed him to me wet in the back and laughed his ass off for about a half an hour And the nurse like did you give him vagina photos? He's like I did it was hilarious One of them had a full bush he thinks there's a goddamn bush on his esophagus. He's a moron We got his dough I got a haircut recently for the big show right it's looking okay, right? I got a haircut. It was like a fancy place. It was in the village here because it doesn't matter Why I had a little few extra bucks and some time to kill so I went to a nice place in the middle of my haircut The lady said do you want me to do your eyebrows? She said it like that in a way that I had to be like I guess so Like she's like do you want me to do your dumb shitty eye brows? That's what I heard I was like yeah, I guess do my eyebrows and I know I have long eyebrows because every once in a while I'll get something in my eye and I look in the mirror and it's like friendly fire like it's like a It's an eyebrow hair that's dangled in That's I was like yeah, do my eye I thought she's gonna use like scissors though like a couple snips You know what you use like electronic clippers and did a full Like all the way across And I wasn't wearing my glasses so I couldn't see my eyebrow for like a full five minutes I was like I think this bitch just shaved my eyebrows off my goddamn face I Was lit I went through a range of emotions at first. I was pissed. I like I'm an eyebrow kind of guy. I like eyebrows But then I got mad at myself cuz I was like well she did ask I'm just an idiot who doesn't know what do your eyebrows means This must be what the young whippest nappers are out here doing cutting their eyebrows off Then I got excited. I was like maybe I'll be a guy that paints his eyebrows out that might be fun I'll go like triangle devil But I still have I put my glasses on they're still there looking nice I did a little eyebrow research for this joke. Did you guys know this? I thought we had eyebrows to keep like to protect our eyes. Did you guys think that to keep like sweat going in? Yeah, well evidently we're idiots. That's not why They think we have eyebrows for non-verbal communication. That's why we have eyebrows So we have eyebrows just so you can be like hey you want to They're forgetting late evidently. I didn't know I knew And then you ladies can be like And then we're like That's the only communicative hair really I mean pubic hair you can communicate with but that's not what it's for We've all done that though before when you hook up a cello for the first time and you got like a big full bush You're kind of communicating. I did not see this happening. I thought that I thought we were friends. I don't know This will look better next time you see me my apologies Anyways, so I don't have kids, but Here's another reason to not have kids. I think that like you can mess your kid up That's like a bummer You know what I mean like as hard as you try your kids still end up like messing like my parents are great parents They're still together. They said I love you a couple times they hit me twice hug me twice. You know what I mean good balance That was supposed to be funny. I thought you guys got sad But still I'm a mess. I have like OCD Exity alcoholism herpes that one's probably on me, but I just throw it out there. You know what I mean? Why not I Got I got trauma, you know nothing too serious. I'm not gonna get it make it weird in here But like why don't I want as a kid this like this hurt me. I was a little kid. I went with my dad to pick up pizza We ordered pizzas and I was like I'll go with you to pick it up And then we picked up the pizza and he just forgot about me. He left me in the pizza place Yes, some people are laughing and some of your gasping both fine However you handle it I looked up it was scary. I looked up. He was like pulling away. I had to run out there like an action movie He was like no My banged in the window. He was startled He's like oh shit. Sorry It hurt the worst part was the pizza was in the passenger seat. That's what hurt He had to unbuckle the pizza and be like oh my god. I knew something was there that I loved something warm I had to sit there crying in the pizza heat, you know My asshole all warm I Got over it because there was pizza but you know To this day I can't use seat warmers in the winter my friends like you want a little heat. I'm like no no don't touch it Oh shit my pants are start crying. You don't want me to know he I brought it up to him recently. I was like remember that time you left me in the pizza parking lot And he was like tell it to the therapist and I was like No No, no, I did he said I should confront you. That's why I'm thinking that way Lot of trauma of revisited recently my wife and I during the pandemic we just watched a lot of movies I rewatched uh dirty dancing. That's a great movie right everybody remembers that one So all of your shrugging didn't care for it. You know like it Or you don't know it or you don't like it you never see it. No, you're gonna check it out. It's a hell of a picture, but um Yeah, maybe you'll enjoy the joke anyways I've never watched it's a very sexy movie if you didn't see it. It's very sexy. You love it It's very hot there's one seat Patrick Swaisy. He's in there very hot guy and at one point I don't know if you remember this you don't remember this but some of you might remember this He locks his keys in the car by accident and then it's raining. You remember? Yeah, it's raining See she's getting like hot and bothering over here It's raining and so he kicks a fence post out of the ground by the way. You see that MMA training did anybody see how I kind of I Kicks the Kicks a fence post out of the ground. He smashes the window of his own car And then he reaches in and he unlocks the door and he's all wet and that's a sexy scene I know that because the first time I saw it I was eight and my mother went Mmm And I remember thinking something just happened to mom and I don't like it I don't know what's going on, but I'm uncomfortable now and then I realized only years later my mother got vocally horny next to eight year old me Like she was like yeah fucking Swaisy cock And I felt back to my dad sitting there and he's like I've never heard you make that noise I'm like I never heard anybody make this noise can we clean it up I felt bad for my dad because now my dad knows my mother's into Patrick Swaisy And I don't know if you guys could tell my look at him. He my dad does not look like Patrick Swaisy I got more of a Steve Bushemi dad, you know Very nice I Feel bad when I took my dad up so a couple of years later I locked the keys in the car on purpose. I was like oh shit dad I kept those keys out up He was like I'll call AAA and I was like god damn it dad Smash that son of a bitch I My dad he was sweet, but he didn't know what was going. He brought point break home a few years later Remember that movie that was Patrick Swaisy canna Reeves. You see that one no god damn you It's a hell of a film He's like I thought it was as a family. I'm like there's no chance at hell. I'm watching this movie with mom in the room. I'll tell you that You kidding me? We're all gonna be surfing when mom squirting all over the goddamn living room Um Watching Patrick Swaisy and Keanu Reeves and wet suits She can watch that alone. That's Deb time How about four scum you see four scum there you go you sound how one right I love that movie Some people hate it. I love it Best picture 94 Fantastic if you ask me I got beef though. I rewatched it movies get different as you watch him like later in life And I got beef with one of the characters Mrs. Gump specifically played wonderfully by Sally Field whose Tom Hanks's mother in that movie and a love interest in a movie four years earlier so Little little movie magic This is my issue remember the scene where forest got he graduates in the University of Alabama somehow We're not sure how exactly it's a little iffy Early on in the film. He's too dumb to get into kindergarten Later he graduates to the University of Alabama He couldn't get into kindergarten his mother had to bang the principal. That's how he got it This was pre-me too movement. That was a fair exchange back in the day It gets into the public school system Place football graduates university of Alabama and then a graduation remember this He graduates and a guy in an army uniform walks up and he hands up a pamphlet And he says have you given any thought to your future and forest says thought because he doesn't know what thoughts are He's confused And then it just cuts to for he's on the bus he's joined the army and there's a trolling start to like get your bitch ass on the army bus You pussy or whatever and for us is like oh my god. I think I made a big mistake And this is where I have an issue with Mrs. Gump. I really feel like she should have stepped in and looked out for her son If you're not even into the movie he's in grave danger. He's going directly to Vietnam. It's 1968 And here's what I think I think Mrs. Gump wanted to get rid of forest. That's what I That's the argument I'm presenting I think she was like I'm tired of paying for leg braces and banging all these principles That's a great idea Go to Vietnam see what you can do out there Because he wasn't going to get drafted he was safe He was draft exempt for a few reasons one. He was a college graduate Two he was his mother's only son and three he was retarded so I feel like I feel like he was safe Then he came home two years later. He's like I'm home mama. She's like you gotta be shit me. Are you serious? God damn it Oh I thought I took care of this that's great He's like how's Bubba he died he died Sorry I'm from the 90s I apologize You Guys are so great. I feel like I can knee you right yeah, thanks Let me see in my head here I got that one oh yeah, I got a bank. Yeah, I remember now It's down to cell phones and shits You guys don't look at your phone they take your phone here though, right? They're all wrapped up That makes it easier to not look at your phone now. I'm triggering everybody in the room though You guys are all like oh shit. What are what's going on in my phone? Very hard not to look at your phone. We're all addicted right It's hard some comedians get mad. They see someone the audience look at their phone They'll be like hey get off your phone. You're son of a whatever I just got jealous I'm like shit. I wish those look at my phone. That is better It is better than all of my thoughts I'm trying to not look at my phone anymore. I read a book called how to break up with your phone by my friend Catherine Price anybody read that book Nobody read it great I highly recommend it. It's great. I mean, I'm still addicted to my phone, but it was a fun read One tip in there it said write down waste of time on a piece of paper Take a photo of the piece of paper make that photo the background picture over your phone So when you open your phone it says waste of time and that activity is a waste of time because It doesn't work at all. I hope my phone. I was like oh, I remember doing that. That was crazy And I looked at my phone from about three and a half hours I've worked once but I had a good time doing Another thing the book rate of amends is an app called the moment app and the moment app tells you how many times you picked up your phone that day It's a good app. Yeah, you have it. It's nice. It's supposed to help you quit It doesn't help you quit though. It just makes you want to kill yourself. That's all it really does I'm like wow 178. I'm a piece of shit I used to drink a lot if I had an app that was like you drank 17 captain of coach today I wouldn't quit. I'd be like you god damn right. I did And then I'd tip over a table and try to have sex with a really heavy woman. You know what I mean? It's not gonna help me I came up with an idea for my own app. I take a little bit of that But then there's repercussions it tells you how many times you picked up your phone But there's some repercussions you pick up your phone 50 times and one day we send a picture of your dick to your mother That's like That would be a good app You're like holy shit I'm at 48. I can't sexually harass my mother. Let me put this god damn thing away until tomorrow But then a half hour later you're like I got a pretty good tweak on let me just double check She's seen it before she'll be fine She probably won't recognize it. It's been a few months years shit. Oh god I'm trying not to look at my phone, but it's hard because once again comedy very isolating I'm traveling by myself all the time at this point if in our society if you're by yourself in public You should be required to look at your phone Because otherwise you're just You're making everyone uncomfortable I was on a subway the other day every single person's looking at their phone except one guy just looking at the window I told a cop I'm like you might want to keep it on that's some of a bitch over there. You see in this It's guys looking at trees and smiling I was at a restaurant. I'm trying to look at my phone. So I was like I'm not gonna look at my phone So I'm just sitting there Like a lunatic and then they set two people like right next to me two old ladies and they start talking And so naturally I just start listening to their conversation Which is just social media basically. It's just two strangers talking and I'm like, oh interesting. That's not what I think And then at one point the lady was like my son's having a baby And then we just kind of caught each other's eye for a moment and I gave her a literal thumbs up I gave her the glasses emoji and a thumbs up and I was like we're living in a goddamn matrix. I think I Anyways time for the shit jokes Oh, thanks My wife and I we share a small apartment during the pandemic and like you know you got to go the bathroom, right? Of course But you know what you're like partner to hear you shitting. That's no good Right? Yes Why don't we do this do you guys do this maybe you have like houses? We have a small apartment I would say I could use the bathroom. Don't listen You guys ever do that? I say don't listen And then I remember my wife doesn't listen when I'm talking so I don't know why I'm worried about her listening to me shit Like I tell my wife my best story she's just scrolling Instagram. He's like, oh that's great I like the idea that I'm like I'm gonna take a shit. She's like let me put my phone down for this. I want to get Like I'm like don't listen like she's like please You know what you're party to hear you shitting but some people I do want to hear shit like some I don't have health insurance because I'm an American right and I have a bad diet I'm always afraid I'm dying so that's like my health insurance. I'll over here somebody's shitting and I think oh I'm fine have you guys ever had that You're like a public restroom me to see like oh And you're like I'm good for a while. I don't make that noise when I'm shitting I got a few years before I need to see a doctor Sometimes I'll thank him like hey, I appreciate that sir. I hope you feel better. Thanks for your service Every once in a while you're here someone shit so badly that I'll wash my hands like a half hour because I'm like I need to get a look at this guy's face. I don't know You guys It's like a game of chicken he knows I'm out there, but I'm like I don't have a job sir. I'll sleep in here I'm gonna put a face to that noise Then he comes out and I'm like I knew you're gonna look like that somehow I knew what you look like I could tell The problem with public restrooms the stall door never fits perfectly right when you go into a bathroom Like here these ones are good, but the stall door. It's never like flush. There's always like a seam there It's like the word and sometimes it's like way too wide Like you ever sit down you're like why can I see both that guy's shoulders right now Usually it's like a sliver like a shirt color and then you sit down you're like I could see an entire human hi I want recently. I don't know how wide it was exactly, but I know this it was wider than a child's eyeball and The reason I know that is because I was in the bathroom and a kid walked right up to me and just looked right through there was space on either side Have you guys ever made direct eye contact with a strange child while you were shitting probably not right? I just kept staring cuz I want to let him alpha male me. I just kept Eventually he broke the silence he went dead I It's like does he think I'm his dad or does he want his dad to see how I shit like is he like dad It's good to be back. This is fun. I missed traveling around doing comedy my last gig before the shutdown I was in the Plano, Texas. That was like my last gig and I got went to the airport I got a ride to the airport in a cab and the cab driver was making small talk with me Now I hate making small talk with a cab driver because I feel like I have to agree with whatever he says I feel that way anyway, but especially in a cab because they have your life in their hands Like I'm always afraid of me like that doesn't really make sense And he'll be like well, maybe this will make sense the fucking piece of shit You guys So I disagree with whatever he said we pulled in the airport huge airport Dallas Fort Worth airport second Biggest airport in America we pulled in and I said this airport is huge. I'm very good at small talk That's one of my skills And then he said oh yeah, this airport right here bigger than the state of Maine He tossed that out there now Many of you are laughing some of you are not laughing. Let me just help you out with this show. He is incorrect The state of Maine is bigger than the Dallas Fort Worth airport In fact all the states are bigger than all the airports. That's how That's how states and airports work the states are bigger But I went with it. I was like wow man, that's crazy I wanted to be like that's literally crazy. You seem like an unstable human being but thinking that that could possibly be true I even looked around I was like oh yeah bigger than Maine over there That was embarrassing. That's not the most embarrassing thing I don't even like to admit this but I get out of the cab and I googled it. I was like let me just do a double check real quick You're gonna do that when you're talking so you're like this guy's a fucking idiot and then you're like I'm pretty stupid Also, so let me just make sure Google it and I was correct Maine is bigger than the Dallas Fort Worth airport And I'll tell you what guys it is bigger by quite a bit actually I'll give you the numbers real quick. I don't want to make it seem like I'm just picking on this guy here are the stats Dallas Fort Worth airport huge airport 27 square miles Very big that's very big for an airport state of Maine 14,583 square miles This guy wasn't even close He was off by the entire state of Maine basically You missed it by Maine I knew it was wrong because you can't have an airport the size of Maine that would be too big for an airport You dropped off your terminal you're like she's not gonna drop it the wrong terminal. How do I get to terminal B? Oh, it's a nine hour shuttle. You're gonna have to make a bus Nine hours you might miss your flight Fortunately, we do have a flight that goes from terminal A to terminal B That's a 30 minute flight you want to grab that You have time. It's delayed it right out of fuel Because it was taxing on the runway and the runway is 475 miles long If you're unhappy about it you can write to one of the two senators of the airport We have two senators and one governor here at the Dallas Fort Worth airport You guys are fantastic thank you guys so much Thanks very much You You You You You
13 June 1997 Open Ladies andgy, welcome to the stage, chir�� of the office. Director, director, producer, length of a PC, Winner of three gold worlds, 2 point time manage and 7 actors. All the way from England, Mr. Retty Jabbay! Thank you! Hello, Chicago! Hello! Hello! Hello! Thank you so much! Thank you so much! Thank you! Thank you! That was amazing welcome! I should explain something straight away. Usually when I come out on stage, it's amazing, okay? I'm doing cartwheels and back flips. It's fucking spectacular, right? But I've hurt my back. That's true, actually. I've pulled a muscle in my spine playing golf. I know what you're thinking. Sir's been right for playing such a stupid game as golf. But, um, no, I've been in agony. I'm actually on painkillers right now. So, uh, no, it's true. If I suddenly start talking like Paula Abdul, you'll know why I know. Uh, not drunk. So, when the doctor, this is true, when the doctor gave me the painkillers, he said, no, you can't drink alcohol with ease. And I went, I don't want them then. Anyway, he went, what? I said, give me some, you can't drink alcohol with. And he went, well, you're not meant to drink with any painkillers. Who are you, my fucking mother? Just... So, I've been walking around like the elephant man for days. But without the big cock, obviously. I assume you had a big elephant's cock to match the head. No, that would make things all right. Then wouldn't it? That would sort of balance it out? No, because then he'd look in the mirror and he'd sort of go, oh, no. Oh, look at that fucking head. Oh, hold on, no, what's going on down here? Swinging round and round. Let's celebrate. The buns are on me. So, yeah, that's my problems. I didn't cancel, though. I didn't hate that one. And I asked, can't you cancel? Can't you cancel? Do you just saw a throw? Oh, I couldn't go on. I was depressed. I'll pour a little artist. Can you imagine the labourer trying that? Turn it on. I've got a little ticker on on Fed up. What the fucking bricks mate? Never cancel. I had a gig in Dublin a couple of months ago. As you know, Dublin is in Ireland, which is off the coast of Great Britain. It's not part of Britain, but it's very close. It's sort of like our Cuba, I suppose. It's done. And so, okay. Dublin, O to Arena, 10,000 seats sold out one in advance, flights, but really looking forward to it. A few days before the gig, they start grounding the aeroplanes because there's a volcanic ash cloud over Britain. And if you fly through it, apparently it'll make the plane fall out of the sky. And it was like, that was it. You couldn't fly in that. I mean, a volcano goes off in Iceland, and we can't... What was the point of Iceland, really? Do you want to be... Just fill in all the volcanoes with concrete, okay? Just, in fact, tarmac the whole country and make it a car park for real Europe, because it's a waste of fucking space, okay? And so, I'm thinking, well, I've got to get there. I can't cancel. And there were sort of pop stars and people coming over America and they were canceling their flight, because they couldn't get in and out. I thought, I can't. So, I hired a helicopter, two and from Dublin. It cost me 12,000 pounds, right? Just because I couldn't bear to let anyone down or take the ferry. That was... That was still running. Sure. But that would have meant mixing with the general public. And I don't... This is about as close as I ever... So, I don't know if you're affected by the volcanic ash cloud, but I had friends that were stuck all over the world and they missed weddings and funerals, and that had to put themselves up in a hotel for extra days or that budgeted for. And they couldn't get their money back, because the airlines were saying, no, we can't pay you, because the insurance companies won't pay us, because they're saying it's an act of God. Well, what isn't an act of God? Now, if you believe in God, that's sort of a definition of Him, isn't it? That he does everything. Isn't that right? Everything is an act of Him. He's all powerful. He's everywhere. He invented everything. There was nothing before him. He invented time. Everything. He's across it all. Okay? He doesn't miss a trick, and he's not absolutely minded of volcano going off. He's not going, fuck off the oven on. You know, it's... I know with these insurance companies that can decide what is an act of God. How do they know? Okay? Have they got a hotline to God? They called Him up, do they? Ring, ring, ring, ring. Yeah, look. Could I speak to God, please? Speaking. Oh, I didn't think you'd answer the phone yourself. What did you want? Oh, that volcanic ash cloud. Was that you? Yeah. Yes, that was an act of me, alright? So I shouldn't pay out. No, don't fucking pay him a penny, son. No. Brilliant, brilliant. What have I got you here? Did you make a tree fall on Steve Baxter's car? There's a lot of Steve Baxter's. Steve Baxter, two Akasia Road, Houndslow, it happened at 2.15 on the 3rd of June this year. 2.15, 3rd of June... No, that wasn't me. I was in Africa that day, giving aids to babies. LAUGHTER He does everything. He does everything. Mmm. I don't make the rules. Well, I'm glad I didn't cancel, because it's fantastic to be a senior. A happy, smiley face is probably feeling very fortunate that you managed to get a ticket to see a living legend. Or am I? And... Jala. APPLAUSE I know, I know. You lucky, fuckers. You really? I'm joking, of course. The pleasure is all mine. Thank you so much for coming out, spending your hard earned cash. I know there's been a recession on... Someone told me. I haven't really... Does it still go... I don't... It really didn't affect me if I'm being honest. LAUGHTER Oh dear. We can laugh about it now. No, come on. LAUGHTER I don't understand a recession. It wasn't until last year I found out you could go into your bank and say, can I withdraw my cash? And they could go, no. What? No. Got it. I've got £50,000 saved. You know. Where is it? Lost it. Have you checked the vault? It's empty. What was the point of that? You might as well have kept it in a joyous spot. A little twat. I hope you enjoy the show. Well, you'll let me know, won't you? If I say something funny, you're laugh, and I'll go, oh, I'll keep that in for the rest of the tour. If I say something funny, you won't laugh, and I'll lose that bit. So some bits tonight will be exclusive to you. They... They will be the shit bits, granted. LAUGHTER OK, let's start the show. Let's get on with it. No one wants to be here all night. You can have too much of a good thing. Garnia. Like heroin. What? LAUGHTER Although too much heroin is death, basically. That's when you know you've had too much... You've got a fuck of... I'm dead. A fuck. That's the thing, though, with heroin. You know, try anything once. Kids, sure. But know this. Right? No. You think, I'll try it. I'll try it, heroin. I'll just try one. Give me a heroin. OK? Just have one. Oh, what's it like? Oh, it's fucking lovely. I want more. I can't just tap... It's like pringles. It's like... One should pop. You can't stop. That's... I think that's how it works. I'm not an expert. Believe it or not, I've never been a heroin addict. No round of applause for that. See? No. No round of applause for never having been a heroin addict. If I ever come out and go, yeah, I used to be a heroin addict. I used to mug people and shit myself in doorways. Right? But, it's Ali. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He hasn't done those things for a while. He hasn't done those things that we never did in the first place. Why are you applauding someone for suddenly acting like a normal member of society? It's like... It's like I've lost a bit of weight. I've lost about 20 pounds. Exactly. No. No. You're basically applauding me for only eating as much as I need now. I should have... I should have always been doing that. I got fat because I was a greedy lazy. I was a greedy lazy bastard. There's no other ex-boy... And I... I... I need the people that... They can't be down. They go, oh, well done. You look great. But they won't tell anyone I looked terrible. They're basically saying I looked terrible. But no one told me at the time it was really taboo. I needed weight as to come over and go, fuck off. You've had enough. Right? And that I've been criticized in the past for having a go at fat people. I've never had a go at fat people. I've only ever pointed out the fact that you get fat. If you're taking more calories than you burn off. That's simple science. I don't judge them in any other aspect of their life. But that's how it happens. You get fat. If you're taking more calories than you burn off. Okay? And that's indisputable. Okay? Now, the thing is, people think I'm having a go. I'm not because I don't judge them. If I see a fat person, I don't make assumptions about him other than how they got fat. And this is the other thing. They not... No, wait, wait. Right? Not only is that what makes you fat. People know that's what's making them fat. No one got fat behind their own back. No one... And they went, what the fuck's that? Okay? It's not a surprise. It's a gradual process. You have loads of time to back out from this project. And he... Also, no one's sneaking into thin people's apartments. And injecting their lettuce with a million calories. That doesn't happen. Okay? They know what's... If you've got to blow it with these surrounded by cakes and pies. Right? And you go, you're not just making you fat, don't you? And you go, is it all the running? He knows what... But I don't make judgments. Okay? Other than how they got fat. Okay? If I see a fat person, I don't go, oh, he's fat. Therefore, he's jolly. Right? A lot of them miserable, aren't they? If... If I see a fat girl, I don't go, oh, she'd be pretty if she lost weight. That's rarely the case. Okay? So, don't fall for that. Okay? A lot of them started eating because they had fuck all to lose. So... No. But there's no stigma attached. Because people don't even want to use the word fat now. Because I think it's derogatory. It's a real taboo subject. So they use euphemisms. They go, oh, you know, Brenda, the big girl. What? Seven foot... No, no. Not to. She's like, Brenda, you know, she's the one who's clammy even in winter. Just say she's fat. Nothing wrong with it. Is there a choice up to you if you want to be fat? It's fine. They go, you know, Brenda, she's out of breath just standing up at her desk. But, even though it is their own fault, and it is their own fault, I think sorry for them. Right? Now I do. Particularly fat women, because fat is a feminist issue. Men get fat and we just go fuck it, all bought and paid for, you know. We don't come under the same constraints of society. Or as women are inundated with images of how you should be. Sci-zero models, this diet, that diet, look like this, keep your man. And they make such an effort, don't they, fat girls? They've all got lovely hair. Oh no, they're all having their hair. They've all got lovely hair. Oh, it's got lovely hair. Oh, it's got those lovely false nails. Oh no, they make an effort. Anything but jogging. Right? They love high heels, don't they? They think it makes their legs look less, it doesn't. It just... Even just here I'm coming now. I don't want any fat people to feel uncomfortable with one of my gigs. So next time, buy two seats. I'm joking, I'm just joking. Shada. I'm not having a go. I'm just pointing out, you know, I was listening to the radio in England a few weeks back. Radio 4, quite high brow. There was a discussion about political correctness. My name came up straight away, right? And there was a phone on there going, oh yeah, well it's not right. I'm Ricky Gervais and he makes jokes about fat people. He wouldn't make jokes about gay people, would he? And being fat is like being gay. What? No, it's not. What? You can't choose your sexuality. As we've established, you choose whether to eat too much or not. You know, with your sexuality, you're born, you grow up, you discover you like same sex relationships. And that's it, your gay, okay? For being gay, to me the same as being fat, you'd have to be born, be straight, grow up knowing your straight, but gradually and consciously, wean yourself onto cock. Oh, happy 16th birthday son. This is Raoul. Sook his cock. Sorry father. Sook his cock, 16 now. Sook his cock. I'm heterosexual. Oh, with his new fangled words. Sook his cock, come on. I don't like cock father. Doesn't like cock. How do you know if you've never tried it? Ah! Sook his cock. I've got sook a one cock. Sook, that's not sook in it. I was playing with it. Put it in your mouth. Put it. Oh, look, look, look. Have a go, you might like it. It's not so bad, is it? I fucking love these. If that happened, then being gay would be the same as being fat, but it doesn't. So it's not, okay? I was on a plane last year, okay, going from the beginning. Okay, going from New York to LA. And me and my girlfriend were one side of the plane. There was the aisle. And the other side there were these two huge fat women. Proper, proper, proper fat. One of them just got on and went, can I have about extension? Yeah, of course you can, you've earned it, right? So, proper. In fact, I was thinking of calling the pilot out and going, should one of us swap with one of them. Otherwise, we're just going to Canada. Do you know what I mean? Look. And one of them was even fat and the other one, okay? And she was there and she'd got on the plane with one of those takeaway buckets of fast food. Bucket. I mean, there's your first clue. When did that happen? When did fat people just give up? When did they go into a shop and go, oh fuck it, just treat me like a farm yard animal. Really? Give me it in a bucket. In fact, just strap it to my fucking head and I just, a bucket. Really, you want your meal in a bucket? Yes. Right? So, she's there and she's chowing down, right? And I swear, she turns to her fat friend and says, this is the best fried chicken I've had all day. But I'm not having a go. I'm not having a go. No, no, I'm not. Because even though it is their own fault and it is their own fault, I don't know if you know this about fat people. They fucking love cake. I love it. They love it, right? And I blame the food industries because you're going to supermarket and it's just packed with that stuff. Everything's packed with hydrogenated fats and extra calories and sugar and butter and everything. And they love that, okay? And there's always a big door, isn't there? To a supermarket? There's always a, they've got quadruple doors, isn't it? No one's ever been too fat to get through the door of a supermarket, okay? And it opens automatically. So after waste, calories pushing anything. There's just, and it's a good job at home, sort of, I'm actually choosing its glass and they can see the pie from down the road and they're in like that. Grazing, right? So I say, keep the big door, keep the big door, sure, keep the big door, come on fat people, come in and go. But when they get in there, it's all fresh fruit and veg. It's all whole grain, it's all stuff that's good for you, okay? Of course they'll be confused at first, that's not real food to them. They think Brussels Fouls is packaging, right? They're looking, where's the cakes? Where's the cakes? The cakes are over here, but the cakes are through a different door, but this door is human-sized, okay? So now they go, there's the cakes, they're going to, oh, fuck, I can't get in, I can't... I can't get through the fucking door, I can't... They're starving, I go, oh god, what's this, I got a pizza, what's this, a banana? Oh, no. And they're going, oh no, it's still got back another carrot. They're back and forth for days and the fat's fallen off them, so they can slip through the door. And I have a cake, they can't get out again. No, but I mean... But we've got to do something, we've got to intervene. And people say, no, it's not to do with you, it's up to them, it's their body, it's their life. And that's true, but we don't say that about wearing crash helmets, or if you've got a hair and addict in the family, you don't go, oh, it's his life, you love Zeroin. You know, you go, no, you've got to stop this, you'll, please, don't die. And you get him, and you throw him in a cupboard for three weeks or something. You can't throw a fat person in the cupboard, you're back in like me, but you know, hair and addicts, I don't weigh anything, you can throw him around willy-nilly, right? But when they lie in there with the needle hanging out, you just get the needle on flick, and they just go into the cupboard like that, okay? Fat people, you've got to lure them in. A little trial of chocolates, and they just follow that anywhere, like that. But we've got to do something, because a third of the world or a beast, and a third of the world are starving. The fat ones are eating the skinny ones food, basically. I know most of the skinny ones are in Africa, so outside out of mind, I know, but no, no. I can talk about Africa like that, because I'm from Britain, and we used to own it. We did. When we had the Empire, and we ruled the world before you took over, we used to, we owned Africa. But then in the 50s and 60s, Africa wanted to be south ruled, they wanted independence, and they said, look, we'd like to run ourselves, we went fine. So gradually we started giving Africa back to the Africans, and by the 70s, it was totally run by the Africans themselves. And of course, in the 80s, we get a phone call. Hello? Hello? Who's that? Africa. What do you want? We're starving. You should have thought of that. Before you wanted independence. Well, we didn't know there'd be a drought, did we? Drought, I'll give you a drought. This is true. When I was a kid, I was about 10, we had a really long hot summer, okay? And there was a hosepipe band. You couldn't water your flowers. We've all suffered. So that's true, actually. One long hot summer, and the water ran out, and we didn't know what to do. We thought, what could we do? And there was people coming around, you're house trying to tell you how to conserve water. They were saying things like, when you brush your teeth, don't let the tap just run. You know, put a little glass there. And they came around, they were putting house bricks in the system of the toilet to save water. And there was public information films on the television. There was one advert that was like an animation, and it was like a couple in the bath. And it said, conserve water. Take a bath with a friend. Which I did. I say a friend, he was more a friend of a granddad's. But no. Ten pounds is a lot to a kid in England. What? He taught me a lot. Stuff like, you don't wash it like that, give it here. No, it was a sweet old man. I used to call him granddad Charlie. He wasn't my real granddad. He was just no bloke that lived across the road. He used to come around whenever he saw my parents go out. He'd come around, momma and dad out, oh, you want to see a magic trick? Yeah, he'd draw the curtains. And he'd close my eyes. And he'd sit down, and he'd put a top hat on his lap, like that. A magic hat. And he'd go, close your eyes, it goes and feel the magic rabbit. And I used to go up and I used to go, I used to go in, I used to feel the little, the weird little thing it was. Didn't have any fur or ears, right? And he used to go, and it was scared stiff it was. It was terrifying. Right? And he made a stroke it for, and I stroked it so fast once that it was sick all down my... Shada, shada, faka. Oh dear. Oh. Well, was I, oh yeah, famine. Famine is a problem. Which brings me to this next fad that we need to stand out. This happened Christmas before last, exchanging gifts with old friends, good friends. Quite well off friends, if I'm being honest. I got them a coffee maker machine from Harrod's, top of the range. They loved it. They gave me my present, it was just an envelope. I thought, oh, what's this, vouchers? Open it up, it wasn't vouchers. It was just a card with a picture of a goat on it. And I said, what's this? They went, oh, our gift to you is we gave a goat to an African family. What? I'm looking at the coffee machine, is it too late to take that back? Is it too late? What is it? Oh, we gave a goat to an African family. Did you? Oh. So, I've got fuck all then, basically. I mean, I don't even know this African family. Why would I give them a goat? This serves no purpose at all. This is no good for anyone. They're 50 quid down. I've got nothing. The African family's going, not another mouth to feed. Right? The goat is going, where the fuck am I? What the f- this is? Shit! A wicking I was gambling around. The cot's rolled. There was grass and torus with nuts in it. This is a fucking dust bowl. There's no way that goat wanted to go to Africa. It was basically, no, it was kidnapped. It was abducted. It was put in a sack and bundled on a boat to Africa, like roots in reverse. There is no way. They went, do you want to go to Africa? You went definitely not. No, no. Oh, come on. Why don't you want to go to Africa? Lions! Come on. Why don't you want to go to Africa? I'd... Well, that shouldn't affect you. It shouldn't. So just be careful with that charity shit, particularly at Christmas. That's when they get you. They give you a guilt trip at Christmas. All the adverts of a charity at Christmas. You're sitting at home, aren't you? I mean, your Christmas lunch, loads of food, too much food. Probably going to throw a lot of it away. And things like this come on the Tony. This runs every Christmas day in England. It goes, is there an old lady near you, cold and lonely this Christmas? Yet a fucking hater. Noisy bitch, one's me up all year round. I can't wait for the cold weather. There's no old lady near me. She died last year of hypothermia, so result. Brilliant. The other big one is a doggy's for life. Not just for Christmas. Right behind that, I'm really into animal welfare. And that's obviously aimed at parents whose kids go, can I have a puppy? Can I have a puppy? Can I have a puppy? No, can I have a puppy? Oh, they get them a puppy to shut them up, right? And the kid likes it when it's cute. It grows up. The kid gets other interests, gets bored with the dog. They love the parents with it. The parents get bored with it. They abandon it. 11,000 pets are abandoned in England last year, which is terrible. And I think, you know, kids should have pets. I think it teaches them life lessons. I haven't got kids of my own, but I've got loads of niece and nephews. And they've got kids there, now. And I want to be a cool uncle and give them what they want. But I want to be a responsible one to and not add to the stray problem. But I think I've solved the dilemma. Here's a tip. This is what I do anyway. You've got a way to Christmas Eve. And I always go to an animal rescue centre, not a breeder. And I go along to an animal rescue centre, Christmas Eve. And I go to the veterinary part. And they've usually got, like a run, who's been born sort of disabled with no quality of life. And they're just putting that out of its misery. Right? And I go, no. Don't kill that one. I'll take that one. And they go, it's only going to live a day. Perfect. Perfect. So, and I run home. I'm going, don't die yet. Don't die yet. Little bit of Starbucks. Little bit of Starbucks. Oh, no, no, no. And I rush in. I call my niece. She comes running. I'm completely, I've got your puppy. Oh, you've got me a puppy. Yeah, your best uncle got your puppy. Yeah. Go and play with it. Go and play with it. I'm going to play with it. I'm going to play with it. I'm going to play with it. I'm going to play with it. I'm going to play with it. And she takes it to bed with her Christmas Eve. And she sleeps. And she wakes up. Christmas Day is dead. Cold. Steph gone. So, result. Not a problem. And they always come down the next day. They're going, oh, my puppy's dead. My puppy's dead. Oh, what the puppy your uncle got you. He did his bit and whatever happened after that. Isn't his problem. They go, yeah. And I go, oh, maybe you rolled over on it the night. Oh, did I? I don't know. Oh, no. And they start, I killed my puppy. I killed my puppy. I go, no, you didn't kill your puppy. Jesus killed your puppy. On his birthday. Because you didn't spend enough on your uncle's Christmas present. They usually put their ideas up the next year. The other big campaign at Christmas. Don't drink and drive. Right behind that as well. A lot more stigma attached to that these days. When I was growing up, it was whether you've got away with it or not. But people now know it sort of, it's, it wrecks lives. I'd be getting in a car when I was a kid with grown-ups and family. And they're going, no, you can't drive. You had too much to drink and they're like, oh, I won't get caught. And now that people know that's right. And I've done it once and I'm not proud of it. I'm fucking ashamed of it. And that was Christmas. I wasn't drunk, but I was over the limit. And I took the car out and I knew I shouldn't. I knew I shouldn't be driving. But I learned my lesson because I nearly killed an old woman. And no, in the end, I didn't kill her. In the end, I just raped her. But as I say, nothing came of it. Luckily for me, a thousand to one shot. She had Alzheimer's. So not a credible witness. Spiders. Oh, spiders. They're always ready, aren't they? Aren't they? They're always ready for action, a spider. It's always completely fucking ready for action, like that. Always ready for action. Always. I mean, some animals are sometimes ready. You start on a cat and they go, for a few seconds and it goes back to chill. Most of the time, a cat is just laying on the floor and it just on its side, all four limbs just stretched out in one direction. You will never see a spider like that. You will never see a spider just lying on the carpet. It's head down and all like legs just stretched out like that. They're always ready. They're always ready. And they're always ready in every direction, like the fucking matrix. Like that. They don't have to turn. They've got ten eyes, eight legs and ten eyes. It's over the top. And they're even ready when you don't think they're ready. You can see an empty web. Okay, and you go, that spider's not ready. No, touch the web. What? Touch the web. And it's there. Ah, I fucking hate them. 37,000 different species of spider. I mean, millions and billions of individuals in each species. And that's just one class, a ratnid, of one phylum, our fropter. There could be five million species of animal alive now on the earth. Best guess, okay? And that's one percent of all animal species that have ever existed. 99 percent of all animal species that ever existed and now extinct. And that remaining one percent is five million strong. Take one of those species, termites. If we were to weigh every termite alive now, it would be ten times the tonnage of every human being on earth. And it's statistics like that that make me think that this book isn't totally accurate. Um... It's the book of Noah. The children's edition. I actually got this awarded to me when I used to go to Sunday School every week. I believed in all this till I was eight. Um... It's an Agnes Sunday School presented to Ricky Givayas. R.I. Double Kayi. Like a fucking mongoose, right? For regular attendance. Not even for being good at anything, just for turning up, right? He's always there, give him a prize, he'll be back. Thank you. Thank you. Let's have a look at the evidence. Long, long ago, when God forbid, I'll let both of those points go, we haven't got time. Long, long ago, by the way, according to the Bible, was five thousand years. According to the Old Testament, the earth is no older than five thousand years old. It's actually four point six billion years old. Let's pop that in, pop that in. Four point six billion years ago, when God first made the earth and sky, oh, I don't big it up, it's like, it comes as a package, really, doesn't it? I mean... Do you know what I mean? The sky was never an option an extra. It's like, made your planet, I can't breathe. Would you like an atmosphere? Of course I fucking would, so... Well done, but... Everything was peaceful, everything beautiful. God made human beings too, and he wanted them to be good like himself, arrogant. Right? But very soon they wanted their own way. They would not listen to God, they became wicked and did wicked things. Look, I'm doing wicked things there. You don't get much more wicked than that, do you? Fuck off, I'll fuck off, wicked! Freak! Fuck off, wicked! Freak! Ah! God, just looking on, I'll carry on, see what happens, see what happens. I'll see what happens. Yeah. I'll see what happens. Bloke there, running off of the big bag of money. Don't put it in a bank, you can't. God looked at them and said to himself, they are so wicked, I will have to wipe them off the face of the earth. Really? Really? Straight to genocide? What happened to one verbal and two written warnings? Straight to the annihilation of the entire human race, because a fatty yellow trowels has picked someone's nose. Really? Fuck. Anger management, Matt, just calm the fuck down, let's cracklots. Just, just talk about this. Wow. I read that to Karl Pilkington, right? Who is, yes. Yes. He'd like the fucking orange, I know, yeah. And I read that bit to him, they are so wicked, I have to wipe them off the face of the earth. And Karl said, he sounds gay. I said, what do you mean? He went, some gays, a bit like that. He thought God was having a hissy fit, right? No, they treat me like a bastard, I'm going to treat them like a bimax show them. I'm a whethnaggot. I said, Karl, God is not gay, okay? Read the Bible, he hates them. They are so wicked, I will have to wipe them off the face of the earth. And every living thing with them, was the squid ever done? Weird God, they've gone mad. But he's not gay, God is not gay. But there was one man who was still very good, his name was Noah, he was a friend of God, just a friend, so don't know. Just a friend, a friend with big hooped earrings. Rouge. What, what's he do, he lives in a cave. What's he doing with this? What, what are you doing? Seeing God. You never know. Handle bar moustache. Holding God's hand. Who's wearing a blouse? God is not gay. God said to Noah, I'm so angry with men. You mean men and women? Whatever. I am so angry with men that I've made my mind up to destroy them all. I have stretched my bow in the sky, it's a rainbow. That's got to be the world's first pun, isn't it? It will make so much rain pour down on earth that everything will be drowned, but not you. I want it to build an art. It will be like a big boat with three decks and a roof over it. I know I'd build a boat, mate. Andrew and Michael Dora in the side of it. Do you think I could complete idiot? No, I did exactly what God told him. And then God said to Noah, okay, now this is aimed at children and admittedly. It's taken from the Old Testament story in the Bible, but I don't think the author of this book is a zoonologist. He said there could be five million species of animal. I don't think he knows them all the way, backs out very quickly in this next sentence. I want you to take two of every kind of animal with you into the ark. Two lions, two tigers, two elephants, so on. What, I brought lions, tigers, elephants, so on. There you go. Look after them well and keep them alive. Noah did what God said. Now I want to study that scenario. Okay, so God is angry with mankind. He's fed up with them, they're wicked. He's going to wipe them out and just start again with Noah and his wife. He's angry with the animals too for some reason. So he's going to start again with just two of each species. He calls a flood, they build an ark. That's right, two of each species, two, just two, right, quick. First two. Oh, there's a stampede. Two elephants, two two cons, just walking. Just, just, just. There's no rush. Just strolling, baby. I think this one is a bit more concerned than this one. This one's probably going, should we fly? No. No. No. I can't do this all night. No. No. Sure. Yeah. I mean, we've got wings. We've got feet as well. Why don't you want to push in? That elephant's looking at me funny. Yeah. I fucking have. If you try and push in, I'm going to stamp on you. You big nose, twat. Hold on. Are you calling big nose? What do you mean? No, I just pop call and kettle black. What the fuck does that mean? We know if a pot's, but I'll forget it. I can't forget it. I'm a fucking elephant. Oh. Two camels, two lions, two ostriches, two leopards, two tigers, two zebra. Ah, here's the crux of my point. Just one species on the arc at the moment, the giraffes. They've got their first longer legs. Five million more species to get on there. Two of it. Two animals on the arc at the moment. Ten million more animals to get. Ten million more of those. Ten million. As far as ten million of them to get on there, just two on there at the moment. Look how much room they're already taking up. It's a third capacity. What's it going to be like on there when these two fat cunts get on? Then God bent the bulb his anger and the rain came flooding down covering the earth with water. It rained for 40 days in nights. The flood water rose higher and higher until it covered the tops of the highest mountains. Every living thing was drowned except Noah and the animals in the arc. And the fish. They were fine, weren't they? They were fine. They were loving it. They were better off. In fact, all the sea creatures. I mean mountains underwater, they're domain had increased like tenfold. Also, it's so much more interesting. You've got crabs going, I'm on a fucking mountain. This is amazing. I never want this flood to work. I've never been up here before. I think of that when you see on the news. Like, if there's a little village in Gloucester flooded or something. It's really sad. You see people who have lost their homes and their in dinghies and they're carrying their pets. And you see a little rural antique shops completely underwater. And I think of a fish just looking in the window of the antique shop for the first time. So that's a shed long. For 150 days the earth was covered with water. Then now I open the window of the ark and looked out. The water seemed to be going down, but how could you be sure? Well, I ask God you've been chatting to him all the way through. Why are we... Why are we getting cryptic all of a sudden? He sent a raven out, but it soon came flying back. It could find nowhere to settle. No, I waited another week. Can he set out a dove? Why did the raven lose his job? But the dove came back too. See, the raven wasn't bullshit. This is... There was still no dry land anywhere. But one day the dove flew out and... Why did the dove get a second go and not the raven? Racist. But one day the dove flew out and brought back a green olive branch. And no one knew that God was no longer angry. Then God told Noah to let the animals out of the ark. Then once more, he'll feel the earth will live in things. The first thing Noah did was to build an altar. He offered a sacrifice to God to thank him for saving them. And Noah said, I will make a pact of friendship with you. I will never again send a flood to destroy the earth. The rainbow which I put in the sky will no longer be a sign of my anger, but a sign of peace. It will be a sign of my friendship with men. There it is. That is how it is used today. They took it literally. It will be a sign of my friendship with men, which begins today. And which my son Jesus will one day prove by shedding his blood for men. Who? Your see? There was... There was no teaser campaign in the Old Testament. But... Coming soon, the sequel. And... And so when you have done wrong and you are feeling very sad about it, think of the rainbow and the peace which God wants to put into your heart. He has promised to be your friend, promised to be his. And that is just one of 12 in the Dove Book series. I have only got one, number nine now. Although I think my favourite would be number eight just from the title, Jesus and the cripple. Thank you. Cheers. I read that whole book to Carl and he believed it all. Why wouldn't he? It's written down. And I said, Carl, think how could they get 10 million animals on a boat? Carl went, they said it was a big boat, yet they did. That's true. I said, but they are all part of the food chain. They would have literally had to have eaten each other to survive. Why didn't the lion eat the ant lope? Why didn't the spider eat the fly? And Carl said, because in a crisis you will pull together. Amazing. I would love to do a book of his quotes. I love books of quotations. I would just read them for pleasure. I have a few of these compilations. One of my heroes is Winston Churchill. And when I read, give us the tools and we will finish the job. I thought, how inspiring. And when I read, never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. I thought, how patriotic. And when I read, it is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations. I thought, you cheeky fat git. People always say to me that Oscar Wilde is the greatest genius that has ever lived. Let's have a look at the evidence. Here's one of these. All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That is his. That sounds a bit gay to me. Give me another one. I couldn't help it. I could resist everything except temptation. That sounds gay as well. I think. I want to start that with anew. I want to go, aw, I could now pitch. You know what I mean? And I want to end it with, I can resist everything except temptation. Chance will be a fine thing. And when he went through customs in New York, all those years ago, and the customs officer just doing his job said, have your own things declared, Oscar Wilde, famously said, nothing but my genius. Woo! Wasn't witty about you plan that. About the first time I went through customs in the foreign country, it was all yes sir, no sir. And he declared, no thanks, I need to go. Oh, I just thought something fucking brilliant was saying. Oh, I'm always doing that. Excuse me, can I go back to, no. Oh, yet wait weeks in those days, back on the boat to England, just think it all right. If they say that again, and then declare, nothing but my genius, I'll be in a book of rotations. He gets there again, weeks later, finds the same bloke, goes up to him, bloke goes on you go, didn't even fucking ask me that time. Excuse me, didn't ask me if I had it random, fucking random. Right, back on the boat, three weeks later, gets there this time, finds the same bloke, this time he's starting looking shifty, so he gets picked out like that. All right, bloke goes, goes. All right. Did you buy anything? That's not the question. Say it when things declare. Okay, have your own thing declare. Nothing but my genius, who's the butt plugs, fair mine? In castrated in Reading Jail for homosexuality, we've come a long way from it being punishable to total equality as it should be, of course. In England, the gauge you can send, same as heterosexuality now, 16, and even gay marriage. Although ironically, the one place that was really ahead of the game fell behind a little at the last election, California. They had a referendum, they put it to the vote, and they voted no to gay marriage. I mean, in California, there's people going, that's why we moved here. It's a strange sort of bigotry that you can affect someone else's lifestyle that doesn't affect you back. It's not like they asked a bloke once, sorry, do you mind if these two men get married? They went, no, fine. Okay, jack him off then. What? I didn't know that was going to happen. That doesn't happen. That doesn't happen. It's also a strange sort of bigotry because these people that object to that presumably the same people that said gay people were, immoral and promiscuous, but now they don't want to be monogamous and respectful in the eyes of God. And it must be so confusing to a gay guy in California thinking, that's the bit they don't like. With all the other shit we get up to, it's the marriage bit that must so confuse them, must go to judges and go, sorry, can I get the rules straight? What do you want to know? I just didn't know what we can and can't do. Ask away. Can I marry a man? No. Can I fucking put the arson, give him a little retrial? Please. I'm going to give him a little retrial. Please. Can't marry him. No. But in the middle. Come here. Can I pick up a stranger in the bushes and take him home and jizzle him and throw him out in the morning or crusty and homeless? Of course you can't, yeah. But I couldn't marry him. No. No and don't ask again. Can I line up 15 men? I'm just riffing here. Can I line up 15 men and just jack him off for a laugh? If you want? Yeah. Yeah. It would be difficult wouldn't it? Jacking off 15 men at once. It would be like plate spinning. No. Because you don't even need a tour once really. So you don't have these two ready to blow. But then they'd be losing it and you'd go, fuck it up. Oh, fuck no. Oh, fuck no. Oh, fuck no. Oh, fuck no. Oh. And it's Nakhrin. Jacking off 15 men at once. Never thought I'd say that. Oh. Again. No. There's these people that say being gay isn't natural. Well, it is natural. And I've got a book to prove it. Homosexuality occurs in about the same incident in the animal kingdom as it does in human society. This is a real book. It's called Biological Exuberance. Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity by Bruce Baga-Mill. Okay. The evidence is compelling and it seems there is virtually no species which does not have its gay community. That doesn't mean like chimps on one particular street wearing leather caps and stuff. They sort of spread it out more, really. This is a real book. Can we have the first slide, please? Right. Okay. Right. This is a real book. Okay. Right. Absolutely real. Okay. Two male stunk town macaques in Mutual Felatio. Mutual. They're sharing. They're sharing it around. Next slide. Okay. A male squirrel monkey, right, performing a general display toward another male. He's just going, what do you think of that? And this one's going, what? Suck it. Okay, his little hand. Why? Because we're gay. I'm not you fucking arm. Look at the way he's holding him and he's got his leg up for extra purchase. He's got, get in there, get in there, get in there. Look at him. Can you imagine my face when I discovered this book? Oh my God. Next slide, please. Ah, okay. A female Olympic Marmot mounting another female. Now, I don't know what is in that for either of them, unless the one on top is wearing a strap on Dildo. One more, one more slide. Oh, this is a doozy. Two forms of copulation between male dolphins, genital slit or anal penetration above, and below, blowhole penetration. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Basically, he is fucking him in the head. He's fucking him in the head. Like, I have never seen that on any wildlife documentary. I've never, why have I never seen that before? Why are they doing that? Maybe it's not in the wild. Maybe it's in Sea World, which is like their prison. And they're going, they're going, fuck, say. They put in two males. They, something we think we're fish. We might as well fucking do it, okay? I mean, look at his face. Ha. He's going, Dave. What? Could we not do it at the ass like them? No. It's in the head or nothing. Dave, what? What? Dave, Dave. I love you. But I can't fucking breathe. That is a real book. That is a real book. Can we have a look? I love the fact that he found like a turkey and drag. To show how gay animals could be. The gayest animal in the world. I hope I haven't offended anyone with any of the subject. No, I do. I do. I don't want to try and offend. If I have offended anyone and I'm sure I have, I don't apologize. No, I think you should be able to justify everything you do. I think a comedian should take you to a boo place you haven't been before. Otherwise you could do it yourself. There's enough anodyne comedy out there doing things obvious stuff. There's this spate of comedians saying sorry when they go too far. You should know better than that. There's a witch hunt at the moment with people saying, is there anything you shouldn't make a joke about? No, there's nothing you shouldn't joke about. It depends what the joke is. Comedy comes from a good or a bad place. It's for you to decide what that is. I think there's a big debate about sick jokes. The thing about sick jokes, when we tell a sick joke, it's with the express understanding that neither party is really like that. I wouldn't tell a sick joke to a known pedophile. I wouldn't go, mate, you're going to fucking love this more than anyone's son. It's not up. I've never been in trouble for anything I've said in my professional career, because I refuse to apologize. What can they do? Growing up, you try things out and you get taken the wrong way a little bit. I mean, you know, not... When I was about 23, 24, me and my girlfriend met up with this other couple. They'd moved down from the north of England to London. They used to come in the place, so they used to work. We had a couple of drinks for them. They were cool people and they were fun. After we met them a couple of times, they invited us to a party at their house. We went along. One, it was a dinner party, which they hadn't warned us about. One, it was for their family that had come down from the north to see how they were getting on. Both that said parents and grandparents and great uncles average age about 85. I think we were in afterthought. Oh, God, we don't know anywhere on our age. Oh, that Ricky and Jane. We went along and we were still getting to know them, so we just spoke to them all night. We didn't really mingle with the older people. As I say, we use comedy as a sword and a shield and a medicine, but usually as they get into know you, okay? We use comedy to break the ice. Are you like-minded? What can you take? What do you like? And I've always sort of pushed the boundaries a little bit to try and make people laugh at things they didn't think they could. But then everything turns out okay, I suppose. And I started off lightly. I told this joke. Why did the little girl fall off the swing? Because she had no arms. Yeah, sweet. And they laughed a little bit louder than that. There was only two of them, so thanks. No, so I thought, okay, they get it. They let us go and show you up the ante a little bit. I don't know, you push. And I told this joke. Oh, I need a drink. Start the car, seriously. All right. I told this joke. Make sure the old people couldn't hear. I went, okay, father sitting at home, just reading the newspaper. This little girl comes running in. She's only six. Hello, darling. Hello, darling. You've been playing, yeah, in the park. Yeah. With your friends. One till the man came along. Yeah, man came along. And he asked my friends to leave, so it was just me and him. Darling, go over. Whatever happened, none of it was your fault. Okay, darling. None of it was your fault. But tell daddy every detail what happened. He took me behind a tree, so you know I could see what you were doing. Oh, God, darling, and then what happened? He took my dress off. Oh, God, what happened next? He took his thing out. Oh, God, darling, and then what happened? Nothing, that was it. Oh, we'll make something up. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE CHEERING CHEERING APPLAUSE CHEERING APPLAUSE CHEERING APPLAUSE CHEERING CHEERING Thanks. APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Don't tell anyone that. I wanted to be a surprise. So I told that joke. Carried on, getting a bit drunk. I told that joke. Carried on, getting a bit drunk. I was telling jokes. I eventually sat down for the meal about quarter to ten. They put two tables together. And the host sat at either end. And they put me in the middle opposite this very sweet, but very deaf sort of 80 year old man. So conversation was a bit stilltied. And after about 20 minutes, Ian, one of the host, pipe sound, said, oh, Ricky, tell that joke. All the people went, oh, we love jokes. Do you? LAUGHTER I looked at Ian and he went, be fine. OK. And he got on with his conversation. And so they're all like that. I went, um... Oh, father sitting at her own ring of faith. Little girl comes running. Told the whole joke. Got to the bit. Well, make something up. They went, oh, silence. I looked at Ian and he went, not that one. Thank you so much. You've been fantastic. Good night. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Please. Thank you. Fantastic. Thank you so much. I fucking love Chicago, isn't it brilliant? Isn't it amazing? I've had just the best time. Thank you, thank you so much. I'd risk coming again through volcanic ash clouds. Anything to get, it's phanta. Terrorist attack. I've actually always been a nervous flyer, to be honest. And I flew a few weeks after 9-11. And after 9-11, the world went a little bit crazy. Understandably, the rules changed. There was a lot of anger and fear and confusion and finger pointing. And I'd always consider myself quite a rational, liberal sort of guy. And I tried to remain that way after 9-11. And even in the pub with mates, I'd be the one who was going, no, you can't say that. No, that's a generalisation. That's ridiculous. No, that's unfair. You can't tire over with the same brush. No, it's still the safest form of transport. It's 16 million to one, the chance of a, you know, trying to be rational. That's in a pub. When I'm flying, it's more like, check him again. Can we check him again? He's getting on this, do you mind if I check him? Can I just... And after 9-11, with all the checks, I'd still try to remain sort of rational for the softwares thinking, right, it's harder now than it ever was to get a bomb on the plane. This is, you know, it's the restrictions are tight, it's safer now. And then I found out that a terrorist doesn't even have to get on the plane now with a bomb. They found heat-seeking missiles and they could just park up in some sort of lay-by and take the plane out in the first 10 minutes of take-off. So now I'd be on the plane going, right, we're out of range, who's got the bomb, right? And as I saw, I flew a couple of weeks after 9-11, internal flight and we're up in the air, I don't think we're out of range, right, okay, I'm still a bit nervous. And I said to the air hostess, I said, if you've got any magazines, think of this. She said, quite loud, quite blase, she said, no honey, we've got no magazines, we've had to undertake severe cutbacks because we're one of the companies being sued over 9-11. One, don't mention 9-11. Surely a new rule but went round. Don't mention 9-11 when you're handing out the coffee, just, you know what I mean, right? Two, don't say severe cutbacks. Severe cutbacks. If someone says that, I don't think of magazines anymore. I think of a bloke in an aircraft hangar. Earlier that week going, do we really need all these rivets? It's just, what, terrible midside manner. I mean, I take first class flights everywhere. I know you wouldn't have it any other way. I do it for you, really. Some of the flights I take cost 10,000 pounds, okay? And for 10,000 pounds in a disaster, I expect the front end of my plane that I'm into gently break off and float down to a desert island. It doesn't. I die with the rest of you fucking losers. That's not fair, isn't it? I know you tried to save me but you couldn't. We're just beyond the news. I probably only want to get name checked on the news. You'd be tuned in 30 others but I was just some consolation. But anyway, so, okay. Once I was flying back from New York, okay, 925, a Saturday night, JFK, to London Heathrow, BA, first class. Okay. Now, this is my point. It's fear that threatens rational thought, I think. Okay. I'm there. Now, the whole week leading up to that fly, I don't know if you remember it or it's happened more than once. I don't know. It was a couple of years ago. On every news channel in America, there was a rolling ticker tape that said America on Red Alert. We've had in town, there's going to be another 9-11 in a major city, probably New York or LA, okay, this weekend. Do not fly unless you absolutely had to. I had to. I was filming. I'm the only one in the first class lounge. I still try to remain rational. I was thinking, no, it's safer now. Everyone's looking for a terrorist today. They leave it till Monday. Then it happened. The thing that threatened my rational thought. I had a little bit of a mini breakdown. Into the first class lounge, about 30 minutes before boarding, came this guy. I don't know if there was North African or Middle East or Asian, but yeah, all the gear. Beard. Steer the Tasha case. Okay. And here's your middle class sort of liberal. I went. I was suddenly engaging staff in sort of banal conversation. I fly on time. They're going, yeah, what's the weather like in London? Like they were going to go, it's a bit cloudy, but there is, right? Didn't happen. So I'm left there, right? And I'm looking over it in. And I'm thinking of all the running up to it and the weak, the news, nothing. But now there's a fight between good and evil, between rational and irrational. Okay. This one goes, oh, that's a suicide bomber. Oh, very stupid. Of course it isn't. It is. How do you know? That's what they look like. What? Beard. Don't be stupid, right? Then he makes a phone call and I couldn't understand what he was saying, but he sounds a bit angry. Okay. This one goes, oh, we made a phone call. All right. This one, no, you just made a phone call. Yeah, but not in foreign. A shot up, right? He's been checked, without the rest was been checked. Did they check the beard? Yeah, they checked the beard. Yeah, they checked the beard. And then I'm looking at him. It must have been absent minded with all this going on in my head. And he catches me looking and he does this. He goes, oh, he knows, he knows. Right? This one goes, no, he knows why you're looking at him. He said that sort of prejudice for months now. Stop looking at him. You're not a beard. Yeah, right? But this one starts winning. The fear starts beating all the rational thought in the world. He says, going, no, it could be what you could be. Probably not. Well, no. The stats are up today. Yeah, but still it won't happen. Don't say it won't happen to us. People have 9-11 until it wouldn't happen to them. Yeah, but all the tests. Yeah, where they find new ways of getting through our detection. Then we have to open a game. Yeah, you're right. And suddenly I thought, I'm a god. This is it. This is it. And that wave of nausea. And you suddenly realize, oh, my god, I'm witnessing this. This one goes, okay, right? Let's report him. This one goes, no, why? In case someone thinks we're racist. No, fuck that. Let's report him and be a wrong, embarrassed, live racist, just in case. I don't know. So I don't. And so now I think he is a suicide bomber. And I think I'm going to get on the plane and die, but I'm not going to do anything about it. And I'm nearly in tears. And all this happens in a few moments. And I look over, and he's joined by his wife who's got all the gear. And it's two little girls, okay. And I suddenly go, of course, he's not a fucking suicide bomber. If you're off to see 72 virgins, you don't take the wife and kids along. So no, true. And I got on the plane and of course, he wasn't a terrorist. Now, I was sort of a bit embarrassed and I saw the funny side of it. And that was relieved, you know, and then he was a businessman and a family man. He was playing with his two little girls who kept running up and down and banging into my chair. He wasn't doing anything about that at all, okay. No, he wasn't doing anything about that at all, okay. And he was sort of chasing him and I was squealing really, really going through it. After half an hour, I was hoping someone would blow the fucking plane up. But a really weird thing happened during that period. I got so paranoid about terrorist attack that I started taking private jets and helicopters everywhere just because I was so rich. No, no. No, again, my philosophy was, I'm the only person on this plane and I definitely haven't got a bomb. So we're all right, you know. And I was taking a helicopter one day and I was waiting on the helipad, okay. Rewind two days before that. I'm at home, I have a material, materials, and there's a carton of milk there with the missing person things on the back. And I've seen a thousand of them, okay. This one was slightly different because it was a missing child, which is always sadder. Well, no, it's sad when anyone goes missing, but presumably because of her age, this was an abduction and, you know, and it was also the language. It was a plea from the mother and it was the wording. She just said the name of the little girl, which I won't say, I remember it, and the day and place where she was last seen. And she just said, five years old, blonde hair, blue eyes, always happy, please help me. And it must have stayed with me. Two days later, I'm there. It's like a wolf development waiting for this helicopter. And I'm looking down on to sort of some disused sort of warehouse space. And I'm looking one, right. And someone had put up a brown blanket with this duct tape, okay, as like a curtain. And it had fallen away. And I can see in, this is true story, it's an empty room, apart from a mattress. And on the mattress is a little girl with her hands tied. And my fucking heart, five years old, five years old, blonde hair, blonde hair, blue eyes, blue eyes, always happy. Crying in the eyes out. What? It couldn't have been there, I left it. Thanks very much, you've been amazing. Good night Chicago. Cheers. Thank you. Cheers. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Cheers. Thank you. Cheers, everyone. Good night, everyone. Thank you.

I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game. I'm gonna say I'm gonna get back in the game.

He's about to go all the way through. Oh, how? I'm getting chills looking looking looking. Thank you guys so much for packing out this place tonight. Thank you. And I know the question has already been asked. Why did Gabriel decide to shoot his new special in Hawaii? The question should be what took him so long. So the one thing I want to definitely make sure that happens here tonight is that I'm going to make sure that not only the people in the room here tonight that are not natives of Hawaii, but the people around the world find out things about Hawaii you never knew. First things first, the proper pronunciation is Hawaii. Just so the world gets to hear it right at least once. And believe me I understand exactly how you feel. I totally get it. For me it's not Mexico it's Mexico. I'm going to. Whenever people come to the island you know there's certain things people like to do aside from the surfing or the hiking or the traditional things. People always see the movies and the one thing that always stands out is the layout. People always see the little you always see the guy with the fire. You know he comes out and he makes a stance and you know. And I'm sitting with that looks cool. I want to let you guys know how you can tell if you're about to have a real genuine experience versus some of the more diluted things that have happened here on the island. Let me explain. If you're going to go for a luah make sure you do some research. Don't just go to Amy luah. I'm going to tell you how you can tell if you're on a battle run. There's always a bus involved that takes you from the hotel to the luah. That's a given. When you get on the bus there's a driver and there's always the person that's the host. If the host gets on the bus and you hear this. Hello and hello, everyone. Welcome aboard the King Kamehameh luah experience. My name is Reagan. I am not a native of Hawaii. I'm actually from Oregon. But I have been living here now for three weeks and you only need a few days and you're basically a native. We're going to have such a great time. It's going to take us exactly 35 minutes to get from here to our destination. I've timed it all week. Don't even worry about it. This is our driver. His name is Takah. Takah's been here on the island for over 75 years. He is so hardcore. He has taken a liking to me. He says I remind him of his daughter. He's so sweet. He calls me his little Poonani. He is so nice. So nice. So I have gone online to do some research to find out the type of conditions we're going to have today. And there is a slight chance of rain. Excuse me? Yes, sir. What happens if it rains? You have nothing to worry about. I took the liberty of stopping off in an ABC store and purchasing some umbrellas and some poncho. So we're covered. Excuse me? Yes, sir. Are we going to stop somewhere to get something to eat maybe or get some film? Absolutely. You have nothing to worry about. It's going to be the best time ever. Stay away from that door. This is how you know when you're on a real, low-ox experience. The driver, you know, is there the bus and then the guy gets on and you hear this. All right, everybody. Hey, brother. Turn it down. Turn it down, brother. All right, everybody. I'd like to welcome your board is we're going to Jermaine's low-out. Okay. My name is Reno. You could call me cousin Reno. I know. But don't worry, I'm not your real cousin. So don't ask for money, right? Yeah. Anyway, we're going to have a really good time today. It's going to be a great day here on the island. It's going to be beautiful. Excuse me? Yes, sir. How long is it going to take for us to get to the low-out? Actually, brother, he's going to, um, we're going to get there Hawaiian time. Yeah. What does Hawaiian time mean? What it means we get there when we get there. Pardon me, I have another question. Yes, sir. Uh, I understand it's going to rain today. What happens if it rains? Oh, you're going to get wet. Yeah. Excuse me, excuse me. Yeah. Are we going to stop somewhere to get something to eat or get some film? Hey, sit down, Mahu. Are you talking to me? Hey, Mary. I'm talking to your brother, sit down. And for the rest of the bus is one rain, what Mahu is. It means he really likes coconut. Yeah. Yeah, here we go. That was a good time. First things first. The best low out of go on, and they don't pay me to tell you this. I've been coming to the island for 10 years. The my favorite place to visit is Germain's Lou. Have you ever get a chance? They don't pay me to tell you that. And for the record, there is such a person as cousin Reed on. That's my man here in the front row. Stand up, brother. The man, the myth, the legend. Thank you, man. Thank you. With time and many, you know, coming here year after year and talking to people, certain words I've picked up, certain things I've learned. I finally figured out what shoots means. Anyone that gets to come here to the island, you'll hear people saying that shoots. And I found it, it means yes. Because, you know, because Mexicans, we have our own slang words too. You've heard me. Which is a term of excitement. It's like shoots. It means yes. But you should have heard the conversation I had. This guy was trying to explain it to me. I go, I keep hearing people say shoots. What's going on? Okay, brother. Let me break it down for you, all right? Shoots is like saying yes. Okay, cool. All right. So, let me see. So somebody says, you want to go to the store and I say, shoots. Roger that. Roger that. What does that mean? It means yes. So, shoots means yes. And Roger that means yes. Roger that. How would you, I mean, is there one that you use for one thing versus one that you use for another? Can you give me an example? No problem, brother. Check it out. Somebody tell me, hey, bro, you want to go get a drink? Shoots. Hey, bro, you want to go to the bar? Roger that. Roger that. I got it. I got it. I got it. I figured it out. And by the way, for all the people here on the islands tonight that are not native who are extremely light-complexed. Basically, for the white people. I just want to let you know, when you're hearing Hawaii, if you hear this word, howling, they're talking about you. Howling is the word to describe white people. And it's not a derogatory. I ask questions and it's not. It's just, you know, it has one guy. Where did howling come from? I don't know, and one guy said, well, bro, I think many years ago, some white people come here, right? They got drunk and they start yelling. YEEE-HA! Say, hey, somebody need to take down that howling right there. It's stuck. Trying to figure out howling, all right? But anyways, you guys, we've been traveling so many places. We've probably been in about 14 countries in the last two months. Yeah. I don't know. We're like herpes. We go everywhere. Twice a year. Anyway, that's bad, I know, right? You guys are so close, man. If I slip, that's it. His show was in 3D, but it hurt. It was terrible. It was terrible. So I gotta tell you, when we first kicked off our world tour, we started in Singapore. And for me, that kind of threw me on because just to let you guys know, they do speak English in Singapore. It's actually the number one language spoken, and I didn't know that. And some people are like, well, why would you go to Singapore to perform if you didn't know whether or not they understood you? Because the check was that. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And I'm a little whore. So yeah. The only thing with Singapore is that Singapore, the rules over there are very strict. Like many years ago, an American went over there and he was grafiting on a wall. Okay, he tagged up a wall and they got him. And they don't give out tickets in Singapore. The penalty for that was they pulled him aside, took off his shirt, and they camed him with a stick. And there's no set number, like, oh, you graffiti a wall with two letters, that's four licks. No, the guy hits you until he feels you've learned a lesson. Yeah, that's hardcore. If you're caught smuggling drugs into Singapore, the penalty is death, which makes somebody like myself nervous when you travel with the people that you travel with. Yeah. Yeah, my feet. Oh, yeah. And you know, it's crazy because they play a video when you're going through customs. As you're going through customs, they play a video to let you know where you're about to go into. And it starts off really nice. It starts off sweet. It's like, do you need me? Welcome to Singapore. Singapore, very beautiful country, very nice country, very clean country. If you're caught smuggling drugs into our country, I'll stop you! I'll talk to you! I'll knock you on the ground! I'll swat over you! I'll pee on you while doing gong, I'm style. I'll do that like that! Now, can you and kill you? Enjoy Singapore. From Singapore, we got to go up to London, England to do some shows. It was pretty cool over there, obviously they spoke English. The only issues that I had in London, England were that over there they drive on the opposite side of the street. And that is very, you know, that's kind of challenging for tourists because when you're crossing the street, you're automatically conditioned to come out, look left, look right, look left again, and then you cross. And so when you're there, you have to retrain yourself because you'll come out and you think you're cool. Look, there's no cars coming, let's go. Every other block is like the movie Final Destination. And over there they got double-decker buses. Those suckers are heavy. You get hit by one of those at 30 miles an hour. You know, at least if you get hit by a bus here on the island, you have so much of a chance. First of all, nobody's in a hurry. You get hit by a bus here. Hey, bra. Walk it off. You're okay. Shoops. All right. I've been to the new station here. I've been to the news many times and people always step off the curb and not paying attention to looking at the buildings or taking pictures. And you know, they report them. You know, a man was struck by a bus here today. His leg was broken. Doctors say he will be okay. London, England, getting hit by a double-decker bus going 30? A man exploded today. When he was struck by a double-jack of bus, we have video footage. Some of the places we're planning on performing this next year, we're talking about going to Germany, we're talking about going to Bulgaria, and India. India is on the list of new places we're going to visit. And I'm excited about India. You know, when I was telling people in England that we're going to India, I had Indian people telling me, oh, they're going to be amazing. When you go there, you can enjoy it. You're going to love it. It's amazing. And I just stare and the guy goes, boy, you're staring. Your voice doesn't match. Oh, you think we all sound like, I'm sorry. I live in America. Indians over there keep it real. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. And I have nothing but love and respect for Indian people. I'm going to tell you something right now. Indian people in the United States are the hardest working people I have ever seen. And that's coming from a Mexican, okay? And I'll tell you why I say this. You will never see an Indian person with a sign that says, we'll work for food in the United States. And you will never see an Indian person committing a crazy crime. Like when was the last time you heard of Indians robbing a bank? Everybody. I can't remember, bro. Because it doesn't happen. First of all, Indian people are so nice and they're so sweet. I can't see it. You know, you're going to rob a bank. You need authority. You need to come in their guns blazing. I said, get your ass on the ground. Now, I can't imagine. Would you please take the money? Why are you laughing? I am talking to you. Forget this. I'm out of here. I don't need this. He gets in the car. His partner's waiting for him. Did you get the money? They would not give me the money. Did you show them the gun? I showed them the gun! We better leave. They're going to call the police. They're still laughing. Why did you get the computer? They thought I was tech support. They thought I was tech support. They thought I was tech support. They thought I was tech support. There's too much fun, man. All these different countries. All these different places we've been going. And honestly, guys, it's not possible without the love and support of my family. They made that possible. Because I can't just go take off. You know, you really? Seriously? You know, you're just going to leave? It takes a strong woman, first of all, to put up with me. It's not... Oh, you're going to go travel the world with this crazy guy named Martin who's got tattoos and issues. Have fun. Oh, oh. It's not easy, you guys. Like I said, it takes a lot of love and support for my family. And right now, it's a crazy time because my son is 15. Okay? Some of you know I have a son from my last special. I talked about how he became a dad. And because he's technically my stepson. And the only reason I'm saying that is because he's been in my life for eight years. And he's 15. So I don't want you to look at me. And the math is all wrong. And you're like, he's ghetto. I'm not ghetto. I just hooked up with a beautiful woman who had a pre-started family which is why the math is off. Basically, I took over a lease as what happened. And everything's been going great. But when he turned 15, it started changing. Like he no longer talks to me, which is crazy. Not to say that he doesn't seem in agnostic. He just doesn't talk. And I thought it was personal. And his mom is like, no, he's going through a face. Like he doesn't speak. He makes sounds. Frank, he how's your day? Did you take out the trash? Oh! Like, wow. Like the only person he talks to is at the other end of his phone. Because that's all he does. All day, just text, text, text. And it's funny because he's always like this texting. And when he walks around, he takes little steps so that in case he bumps into something, it doesn't hurt. Like he's like a little vacuum, you know? And then... And then... You know? And when he's taking these little steps, he makes these sounds. And his tongue comes out half way. It looks freaky. Like he's trying to text with it. And I asked his mom, is he okay? He's going through a face. And I could totally understand my son standing in the corner for 15 minutes at his time with his tongue out, making noises if he was a special circumstance. But he's not. Okay, if he was, I'd hug him and love him the same. But he's not. He's a straight-A student in his school. He's at the top of the list in his class as one of the smartest kids. And it's... No, no, no, no, no, no, don't clap. Don't clap. You know why? You know why? Because on paper, it says he's a genius. But at home... It doesn't match. And don't get me wrong, you guys. I believe the good grades are important, okay? But you would think with all the different classes that they offer in school, how come they don't have a class called Common Sense? You know what I mean? Make it the easiest class they have ever taken. Make it so easy that it's the exact same class every single class they have ever taken. That's the exact same class every single day. They don't pay attention anyway. Make it the same. Hello, class. Welcome to Common Sense. Let us begin. Up, down, left, right, hot, cold. Take a shower. Take a shower. Take a shower! I don't know what happened when he turned 15. He forgot how to play with water. Oh my God, and for me, you guys smell so important. It is so important. You know how many people I meet every single year? I am so self-conscious. I don't want anyone to smell me that I meet and all of a sudden have them say, Fluffy smell like ass. Hell no. I know I'm a big guy. That's why I do double the maintenance. Twice the showers, twice the cologne, twice the odour, twice the powder. If I fart right now, this whole area will smell like cinnamon. That's how I roll. You guys will be looking at each other. Is that cinnamon? Yes, canela, canela, canela. He smells like amalazadas. Yes. What's amalazadas? It's a ball of dough with good stuff in it, wrapped in cinnamon. Taste delicious. Anyway, like I said, you guys, for me smell is so important. You know, and the fact that my son at 15 now is, his body is becoming an adult, even though he's... And I try to tell him. And he always forgets and blah, blah, blah. And it wasn't until his PE teacher called us up and told us that what he was doing is he's leaving his PE shirt in the locker over the weekend instead of bringing it home to wash. And so that shirt just broils and simmers in those kid juices. And then on Monday when he puts it on, it's all hard and yellow and just, you know, nasty. And they told us your son is smelly. And I'm like, oh hell no. I took his ass to the store and I bought him a 10 pack of that right-guard gel with a little click on the bottom. And I showed him, frankly, look, look, look, look, look. Every day, twice a day. That's what you got to do. And every day it's an issue. Did you put on the odorant? Ah. I went back to the store and I bought 10 more. And I came back to the house and I started strategically placing them all over the house, one in the front, or one at the back, or one in the hallway, one in the kitchen. So no matter where he's at, hit it, right? He hated that because the neighbors would come over the house and I'd have to explain why there's deodorant everywhere. Like it's a new type of pulpore. And then he starts hiding the deodorant and then he starts lying about it. And I'm like, I'm sorry, but teenagers can't lie. They're too fidgety, they're uncoordinated, they look away, they stutter. They can't focus. I asked them, did you put on the odorant? Hmm? Are you sure? Yeah. Come here. I'm going to smell you. You don't believe me? No. That sucks. Are you wearing the gel deodorant that I bought for you? All right. Take your finger, stick it under your armpit, and then pull it out. Why? Because if you're wearing the gel deodorant that I bought for you, when you pull your finger out of your armpit, your finger's going to be shiny. It's going to look like you have lubricant on it. What's that? Shut up. And then he tells me I'm wearing dry deodorant. Oh, really? I don't remember buying that. And I got in his face and I said, look, Frankie, you don't have to lie. I'm here to help you. I'm not here to hurt you. I said, do you like girls? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, good. Well, guess what? They don't like it when you smell. They like it when you smell fresh and clean. You don't have to lie. I'm going to let this go. But if I catch you lying to me again, that's when he freaked me out and he did this. What? And my head, I heard. Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on. And I'm not a violent person, bro. I'm not violent, but, eh, it's kill or be killed, right? You know? And seriously, you guys, I would never put my hands on my son. And people judged me for that. Oh, you wouldn't hit your kid. You think he's going to call the cops? I don't care if he calls the cops. I'll call the cops. Anyone who's ever seen my specials knows I've had a few run-ins with law enforcement. Okay. And because of one joke where I went to a crispy cream drive-through, are you kidding me? I have become law enforcement's favorite comedian. In the state of California, alone, I've done over 50 shows for the California Highway Patrol. Los Angeles Police have been taking over in California for the last three years. They're taking advantage of those who have been in the state for the last three years. I think it's not that bad. for the California Highway Patrol Los Angeles Police Department, Long Beach Police Department, where I live, I can call a cop right now to go to my house and hold down my son while my girlfriend kicks him. That's how connected I am. I'm not worried about him calling the cops. I'm worried about him calling TMZ. That's why I'm afraid. Oh, yeah, TMZ finds out I beat my son. Are you kidding me? They'll have me on TV the next day. Uh-oh. Looks like chocolate cake isn't the only thing he beats up. So I told my girl what happened. I said, listen, baby, he's lying to me, and he's chesting up. I don't want to have to get physical with him, but I will if I have to. I'm not going anywhere. And see, my girlfriend's different. My girlfriend will actually choke him. I'm not going to lie. She's a little ghetto. Kind of hot. Oh, man, I left town for two weeks to go do some shows. And when I came home, it was night and day. They picked me up at the airport. He jumps out of the car and he's holding the door open like he's valet. And I get in the car. I look at my girl. What's going on? He thinks you're still mad at him, so he's being extra good. We're going to ride this out. LAUGHTER And the whole drive home. He's doing that little song in the back seat. I'm going to clean the room. I'm going to take out the trash. I'm going to walk the dog. I'm going to do the dishes. And when we got home, he did all of it. And I was like, wow. And then we're passing each other in the hallway. And as we're passing each other, he sticks out his arm, bro. And he tap me. And he keeps walking. And I go, excuse you. And you go, whatever. Oh, by, let me take this opportunity to tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a decent person. I'm not great. I'm not horrible. I'm decent, okay? Anybody who's ever met me in the past or will meet me in the future, you know what I'm saying? Hey, I know what's in my heart. I'm a nice person. And if I'm being nice to you and you mean to me, I'll still be nice. But if you're mean to me a second time, I don't care who it is. It could be one of you guys. It could be one of my friends in the back or it could be the new dependent on my taxes. You mess with me. I'm going to mess with you back. And I'm going to step it up a notch so you don't forget. And everybody's quiet. All the kids are like, I don't want to meet him now. Let me tell you what happened. Next morning, I was in my son's room. And I'm standing over his bed. It's 5 o'clock in the morning. And I'm just watching him sleep. I know it look creepy like the movie. And I'm just thinking, what am I going to do to get even, right? And I look over and I see his alarm clock. And I'm like, perfect. Just so you guys understand, it's his job to wake himself up for school. And he knows if he's late because he didn't set that clock. His mom is going to have his ass. He's afraid of his mom for good reason. So I grab that clock and I change a time from 5 a.m. to 730. And it gets better than I set it off. And I grab him. Freak, wake up, wake up, wake up. And he wakes up all scared. What? What? Look at your oversight. Look at your oversight. And he freaked out. Oh my god. Shh. I'm going to help you. And I started handing him his clothes. Here, get your dress. Get your quits your clothes. He's getting dressed in the dark. He looks like a little drunk. Your children. And I grab him and I drag his ass into the garage. His whole face is oily and sweaty. He's got rocks and crust in his eyes. He has a perfect white line going all the way to the back of his neck. As soon as I get him in the car, falls asleep. I jump in and I take him to school. We get to his school. The sun is barely coming out. There is not a kid for miles. As soon as we get by the office, I slam down the brakes to wake him up. Anyway, freaky the belgias ring. Hurry. The last kid went in. You're going to make it go. Hurry, go. OK, thank you. All right. I love you. It was Sunday. Kid messed with you. You messed with Kid. Nine-o'-lotter you ran out of your like, oh, you went back to get him, right? That wasn't the plan. He starts calling my phone. He'll forget him. Look at the phone and it's an old picture when he was still cute, you know? I sent him the voicemail. I look at the phone and I see his mom's face. I'm like, shit. Little trainer. We're trying to play it off in the car. Hello. Pick him up. I can barely hear you. Pick him up. I get back to the school, big old freaking school with one kid in front of it. Aw, man, you guys, he was so pissed off, but I'm going to tell you something. I found something out that week. I found out that you don't have to yell at a kid to get your point across. You definitely don't have to hit one. All you really have to do to make sure they never forget the day that they messed up is embarrass them. Embarrassing a kid is the biggest weapon you can have as a parent that's legal. And so much more effective, you guys. Because I'm going to tell you right now, between the ages of 10 and 19, it's all about image. It's all about, do I have the cool shirt, the cool hat, the cool wristband, the cool watch, the cool glasses, the cool shoes, the cool pants. They want to fit in so bad. You mess with their image at school. Oh, it's mental. It's emotional. And depending on what you did, it's physical. LAUGHTER Why do you think they make such a big deal about bullying in schools and child abuse amongst each other? Because when kids turn, it's not pretty, especially if they have a reason to. Like finding out that you got dropped off on Sunday by your dad because there was a janitor that were working who saw the whole thing go down. And three days is what it took for word to get out. And when those kids found out it was my son, the things they said to him were so bad that when he came home, he was in tears, OK? And I'm not going to let you guys, I felt terrible for like a second. It was bad though. It was. I was moved. He came in all hard. Oh, Brad me. Oh, Brad me. All day long, people been messing with me. It's Sunday kid. It's Sunday kid. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Get him a calendar. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Get him a watch. Why are you just standing there? Say Sunday! Put on the order. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE I'm not going to lie, you guys. I think deep down he wishes that I would hit him because it would be faster. But that's not how I roll. Oh, no. And I got to give credit to his mom, you guys. His mom allows me to be a dad. You know, as a step parent, it's not easy. You can't just come in and run things. It takes time. If you come into that house and you start trying to yell at people and start trying to, no, no, they'll jump all over you. You can't be doing that. Don't go, hey, you tell me what he did. I'll handle it. You don't do anything. LAUGHTER You're like, oh, I've been there, bro. Yeah, all right? Next thing you know, you're in the corner crying when that kid is supposed to be. It's a hazing process in the beginning. Everybody's pushing each other's buttons. Everybody's testing each other. Is this guy really going to stick around? That's what happens. And after eight years, hey, my credit is good. So, I'm going to have to pay for it. I'm going to be there, I'm going to be there. Hey, my credit is good. So, my girl backs me up whenever I make a call. She backs me up. Don't get me wrong. If I make a bad call, she's going to call me on you. If I mess up, she's going to point it out. She doesn't think that all my ideas are good ones. And there's been a few times when I've messed up as a dad. Like one night, I got really, really drunk on the road with my theme. LAUGHTER And I don't know what happened. I started drunk texting Frankie. I don't know what it is about me getting drunk for some reason. The phone just... Ah! LAUGHTER And my girl found out about it. And when I got home, I knew something was up because she called me by my first name. And we haven't used first names in years. You know, since then, it's always been pet names. You know how it goes? You know, honey, baby, sweetie, suce, yes. Something that kind of just... Some of you got that? Good, that's yes. Anyway. LAUGHTER I walk in the door and I hear Gabriel. And I'm like, oh, I'm in court. LAUGHTER And here she comes out of the back. I understand when you're out there. You're going to do what you're going to do. You want to get drunk? Fine, get drunk. You want to text me while you're drunk? Fine, text me while you're drunk. Do not ever drunk text my son again. How do you know who's drunk? Really? LAUGHTER Frankie, come here. Bring your phone. LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Look at this message that came in at 417 AM. Put on the otherant fucker. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE That's a nickname. LAUGHTER No, no. I got to give her credit. Anytime I mess up, she is very creative on how she approaches me. Like the latest thing that she does is she no longer wants to deal with me face to face. What she does is she will find one of the three dogs that we have in the house. And she will start carrying a full-blown conversation with the dog. Telling the dog what I'm doing wrong is a man. You have to understand how demeaning this is to me, okay? I own Chihuahua's. And you mean to tell me two pounds of terror is going to take over and mean... No, no, no, no. And I'll tell you what happened, you guys. I was actually innocent. I was actually innocent. I didn't do anything bad, but it looked bad. I had three shows one night. And after the third show, I was exhausted. So I go on the back to lay down for a little bit and I fell asleep. And I woke up and it was four hours later. And I reached out and I pulled out my phone. My phone was still in my pocket and it was in silent mode. And I looked at the screen and the screen said 27 missed calls. From... I wonder who? There is not a text in the world that's going to fix that. There's not a phone call that I'm going to make at four o'clock in the morning that's going to make this better. I'm screwed no matter what. So I shut off my phone. Yeah, look at all the girls are like, that's where you really messed up. I know. I didn't know you could die twice. Apparently you can't. So I come home, you guys. And I know I'm innocent. So I'm not showing up at the front door with flowers or trying to be... No, no, no, no. I know I'm good. So I show up, comfort it. I walk in and I said, baby, let me just explain what happened to me this weekend before you say anything. And then she starts, oh. Look who's here, Bruno. Look who's here. Daddy's home. Now daddy wants to talk to us. Funny. Talk to Bruno. Let me explain. He thinks we're playing, huh? Really? You're not going to talk to me? You're going to talk to the dog? Somebody's getting frustrated, huh? Kind of like we were frustrated when he didn't pick up his phone, yes he did. She will not look at me. She will not talk to me. She continues to do this for ten minutes. After ten minutes, she has me doing it. I'm sorry. Okay. Bruno! Bruno! Now she thinks I'm making fun of her. Are you mocking me? Now I'm pissed off because now she's screaming in my face so that I was like, oh, she thinks we're mocking her, huh, Bruno? Mommy should have played this game because we can play it better, huh? Yeah, because I can make you talk back to me, huh? That's a ton, though. Yes, I can. Because you love me more. A lover? Mommy's crazy, huh? This is a bitch. Come on. And that started a whole different argument. Oh, my God, you guys. And I don't want you to think into my girlfriend's a bad person. She's an amazing woman. The fact that I only have seven stories about her in eight years says a lot. Don't get me wrong. Five of them happened this year. But that's still way below the bar. And I get questions. I get questions about her. Because in the past, I've done specials and I've talked about other people in my life. I've talked about my mom, I've talked about my dad, I've talked about my sisters, my brother. I've talked about Frankie. I've never really talked about my girl. And so I get people that ask me, we want to know a little bit more. First question that everybody always asks is, is your girlfriend fluffy too? And no, she's not. She's a little bit curvy, but she's not fluffy. And it's not to say that I have anything against big women. Most of my ex-girlfriends were really big girls. When we would hug, it was like arms and pillows. Oh yeah, it was that temper-peedic love. You know what I'm saying? It was hardcore. Like we would hug really, really hard. And then let go. And then our body would come back to normal. Another question that people ask is, is your girlfriend also Mexican? You know, is your girlfriend Mexican? And yes, she is, but that doesn't mean anything. Because I have dated the rainbow. Okay? I just wear a landed. You know, I just, you know? Oh, look. Just wear a landed. The crazy part with my girl is that she doesn't have traditional Mexican features. She could pass for white. Which is funny because the first time I introduced her to my mom, it was quite the show. I take my girl to go meet my mom for the first time and You know my mom she she'll come to the door she'll come to the door if you know she you know She sees you pulling up in the driveway. She opens the door and just waits for you to get there and greets you at the door So I'm pulling up right gets to you know she comes to the door She sees me opening the door and this white girl comes out And she starts cussing me out from the door And my girl speaks Spanish so my girl looks at my mom and she's like oh less than you're at comestas and my mom was like oh my god Oh my god, oh so sorry, huh? You see that mom you see that mom they make them in that color too Another question that I get about my girl is um, how did you guys meet? Did you meet at a show and actually no we didn't meet at a show we met at a bar And see somebody A lot of people don't like that one. They're like oh really a bar. That's not a good way to meet someone It's an honest way to meet someone We were both drunk when we met Which I find ironic considering she has issues with me drinking now You know eight years later the way I see I'm just keeping it real you know those hey man Yeah But no she don't see it that way when we met I was gone she was gone We started talking to each other and at the end of the night I was like wow you have issues You're messed up too We went to go get a bite to eat and then you know nine months later we moved in together And then it worked out for us. I tell people you want to find out who you're with Don't just rush into the relationship right away like you see some of those people after a month We knew it was meant to be Yeah a year later he changed She's not the same. He changed. She's not the same. He changed People don't change. I'll tell you why it looks like they do because in the beginning of the relationship You do whatever you have to do to make it work and the first thing you do is you bite your tongue All of your freaking issues and things that bother you you check your own morals because you want to make it work You start weighing out the pros and the cons They're like oh man. She talks a lot but look at that butt Oh man her family's kind of crazy, but they got money You know so you start weighing things out that's why it looks like the person changed that you're later And I'm just saying you guys if you don't feel like investing a lifetime trying to figure out who you're with Just do what I did and get drunk with the person But don't just get drunk to get drunk get drunk with the intent I'm getting as much real information out of them so that you can make an educated decision on whether or not to be with them Make it fun Make it a game. This is what you don't know. This is what you do you sit across from each other You make a list of five things you have to know before you become exclusive Then you break open a bottle of tequila or alcohol of your choice You do 10 shots each you wait 35 minutes you turn on a flip cam hit record and let the date begin You're about to find out who you're really dealing with make it fun. Okay, Jennifer. Um, you go first. Thank you, Jonathan. Thank you. Okay, question How am I Okay Okay How many people have you slept with and guys can lie but the face gives it away how many Two Have you ever cheated? No Oh Next day you pull up that video and you confront them and you can see for yourself who you're really dealing with and if you can see that they're lying Call them out. Jonathan. This is the saddest thing I've ever seen It is so obvious that you're lying. There's no way in hell. I'm ever gonna be with you Why don't you just be a man and tell the truth? How many people have you really been with? Oh man Over 20 over 20 I've never cheated. Oh god. I cheated on everybody How could you do that? How could you cheat? How could you cheat? I was my last then Oh Is some of your clapping summer laughing summer like it's still not funny I'm not making fun of mullet station. I'm only making fun of the fact that Alfred said it It's all tense now some people over there. No, they gotta go pee go ahead go pee go ahead They're freaking out. Hello. I'm not TV. I'm right here I told the venue to I said you know what they got to do for the special they got to put speakers in the bathroom under the toilet So when people get up like that to go pee I can mess them up and go Welcome to the rest room If you need to go pee pee please you stall number one if you need to go po po please you stall number two. Thank you Yeah Like a to the rest through Hell yeah, that's what I'm saying if you need to pee you stall number one if you need to shit take your nasty ass home So some of your laughing something like stop doing those voices Just having fun. That's all I gotta tell you guys being a comedian has been the uh one of the greatest experiences for me and uh You know, it's it's been a it's been a fun ride. It's been a fun ride and um a lot of people don't understand what has gone into this You know me personally. I got a lot of people to thank my family obviously first and foremost and all my friends and all the support And all the people you don't see that are behind the scenes that have helped me and there's a lot of comedians up there They do really good and for some reason they start you know going crazy and things happen and then what happened wrong people around them So whenever you see me you're like oh gay was keeping it together because people keep me together You know, I start believing my own hype. I'm at 7-11. Yeah, give me all that shit. Yeah. Yeah. Keep me slurping. Give me crazy Why is she talking to me like that? I don't know Just want you guys to know It's been a fun ride and I want you to understand a little bit more of what has happened over the years to get to this point For the first I'd say the first 10 years of my career. I was considered a southwest comedian by promoters Meaning that they would only promote me in California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, you know, New Mexico Nothing wrong with that But here's the thing is that they were calling me a south was comedian and then they call me latino comedian and I hated that no No, I hate that I'll tell you why and I know you have good intentions when you will let me explain why don't like that title When you say latino comedian it makes it sound like I can only perform for Latinos Okay, and don't get me wrong. I know who I am and where I come from But I believe that Latinos should be shared with everyone and that's what I'm trying to do and the reason why I make a big deal about that is because anybody else You just call them their name for example Jerry Seinfeld He's just Jerry Seinfeld. He's not Jewish comedian Jerry Seinfeld Chris rock is just Chris rock. He's not African American comedian Chris rock But with me I was always latino comedian or fat comic Yeah, they wouldn't even call me fluffy those bastards And so it wasn't until years and years of grinding it out that eventually I wound up meeting a promoter Who eventually became my manager who took a chance on me and he promoted me in Minneapolis, Minnesota Okay, and you cannot get any wider than Minneapolis, Minnesota That is where the howlies are built That is the howly factory okay as Minneapolis, Minnesota And it was a venue about as big as this and it was it was sold out and word got back to Los Angeles and to New York and to all these promoters That there's this entertainer with the last name Eglaceus who sold a bunch of tickets who was not Enrique Next thing you know promoters are coming up the woodwork now they're changing their tune now They're not calling me latino comedian anymore now they're saying oh this guy's he's funny across the board He's crossover.

I couldn't get over that I honestly thought that they were gonna be like the people from Fox News And I felt terrible. I felt terrible because I was judging them I was prejudging them and I thought that they were gonna be a certain way and I felt bad because all those years People were doing that to me not really giving me a chance and I was over there doing the same thing I felt so bad and then when I met the prince I was still judging 19 years old and he's a prince. I thought he was gonna be a brat He walks up to me and I was already like I Failed to realize that he's a prince and he was brought up to be a prince The way he carried himself he intimidated me in about 18 seconds Okay, I'm 36 and I mean, oh what's up and he's like Gibriel Excuse me Gibriel Gibriel Gabriel I understand that your name is Gabriel but in the Arabic language your name is Gibriel I was welcoming you in our language I'm a dick And I started already imagining what was gonna happen Ah Jebriel I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry and he was so nice you guys he's like I want to thank you for coming here to react and doing all of these shows It was so beautiful to see everyone having such an amazing time from the little children in attendance all the way to the elderly people with a cane Everyone had an amazing time. Everyone. It was beautiful. Okay, beautiful religious people laughing religious police Laughing They don't laugh at shit I want you to understand how big this is there was an American here entertaining people from Middle East There was no violence no blood shit no problems everybody was smiling everybody was getting along It is possible an American was here an American was here He kept saying American American American freaking ten years being called a Latino comic I had to go all the way around the world to finally get called American I was excited. I was like say it again American And then I had the most surreal conversation I have ever had with the person he looks at me and he says I want to thank you for everything I want to invite you and your friends to come to my palace so that I may entertain you Look are you freaking kidding me? I am not getting invited to a palace by a prince Oh my god up until this point my only experience with royalty was a burger king drive through All of a sudden one of those SUVs pulls up And a guy jumps out in a suit and I guess his favorite word was please because that's all he said please Please Please Please Please Are you kidding me? There's a man in a suit trying to get me in the back of a Lincoln navigator And there's a prince inviting me to his palace. I'm not gonna lie. I felt like a hot chick I don't know. Oh my god. Let's go Hurry up bitch. Let's go We Get to the front of his palace you guys. I'm not gonna lie. It didn't look like a palace The walls are really high. There's bob wire around the entire property and there's two guys in the front with machine guns I'm looking at this and I'm like this doesn't look like a palace And I started thinking what if I'm on some messed up episode of Middle Eastern Punt You know what I mean like you don't do go to palace you go to prison you're a bountie You Fortunately the doors opened up and we drive in and then they closed and when we get outside you guys What we saw was amazing outside desert inside? Palm trees bushes shrubs a pond and he had exotic pets. I know exotic pets because I know what I have Over there Freaking zebra Monkeys and he had a freaking bollacan striker. I'm like are you kidding me snakes monkeys a zebra and a tiger? Oh my god that makes me kung fu panda And I started thinking what if he decides to keep me It sounds messed up, but let me explain As an american you cannot just purchase an airline ticket to go to Saudi Arabia You have to be invited by a person of power You know when I left Detroit to go over there I had to fill out a form that says I understand that I'm going to Saudi Arabia and should something happen to me One of those things on the list being kidnapping conveniently right above death America is not responsible the prince could have actually your mind Two weeks later now he's showing someone else around right It is my snake. I think it's my zebra. I think it's my Mexican. I think it's my tiger He said a some little box. This is gibriel But it never happened and we're walking around and I actually pulled him aside for a second I said listen up. I got to tell you something. Well you tell me I need to apologize. What did you do? I didn't do anything I just want to apologize for coming here with the wrong mentality. I says unfortunately. I thought that Just you know because it is the Middle East. I thought you guys were gonna be rude and everybody's been nothing but nice Ah, I know I didn't think you guys were gonna speak English so well and understand you know so many references and you guys get everything Ah, I know I thought you guys were gonna throw rocks But you were funny What What never mind Twitter three where So we're walking and He's showing me this and that and we're just kind of like looking around I thought it was great and then I saw something that freaked me out We're walking in the direction of a giant cage and when I saw the cage I stopped oh like Oh, what's with the cage? Take a look great So I walk over towards the cage and I look inside and I notice that there's birds in there and I'm like oh, okay Cool, it's a bird cage. You got off-fland area. That's not regular birds Those are falcons like okay, well you have a lot of falcons Well, you use a falcons for hunting you hunt falcons? No, no, no, no Each falcon is very expensive US dollars they are trained we go out and we shoot a little animal and we send a falcon to retreat Would you like to see no no no no no no no I got little dogs. I don't know Bye Bruno Before I know it here comes the other guy please please Please and he goes inside the cage and he puts on this leather glove that comes up to a zealball And he starts getting one of the falcons I'm watching them do this and I notice all the falcons are on these purchase about this high And there's about 15 in a row and they all have hoods covering their eyes And I asked them why do they have hoods on the rise man they look like little hostages Shit I'm sorry. I meant no disrespect by that man Seriously no No disrespect I was a slip and he was cool. I understand medallist hostage hahaha Okay, all right So the other guy comes out and he's got a falcon with him and he's got a glove and he hands me the glove and I put it on and he transfers his falcon to my arm And uh all of a sudden he starts doing snapping things and he's basically showing me that the falcons trained and I thought that was Graph I thought we're gonna kill something. I'm like no, but we're just playing with the falcon and I started getting excited You know and the more excited I got the more the prince started showing his age Because then he got excited. I'm like this is great. You these great. Yes. This is so cool. So cool Oh my god, you're so lucky to have so many falcons. I am so lucky. Would you like a falcon? So matter of fact like would you like a cookie? Would you like a falcon? Same way Like are you kidding me? Don't give me a falcon that can retrieve things. Sure.

Why do you pick San Francisco to shoot your special? This is one of the best tales I ever do comedy and this is the most historic venue you got as far as comedians have concerned because many brews ripped it down. All the best came through the bay. What about Richard? What about the Ryan Williams, Tarlan, Mooney? All they said have to be the biggest star. As long as you come with it and people coming out they like to see live performances because it's a savvy audience. San Francisco, all you better! I don't need you to give you all you better! Welcome to the show, here for... The show's finally over! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, man. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I'm throwing it all right. Yes, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you for coming. God damn. I did it big this year. From cable nigga God damn. Thanks for coming out and thanks for making a niggas feel comfortable and the gayest place on earth. You guys got Disney World jealous out this motherfucker. Man, I didn't really think it was that gay at first. I was like, what is everybody? Because when I was coming out here when I was like, man, that place is really gay. So what the fuck is everybody talking about? It's not so gay. And then I wanted into that Castro God damn. I said, this is America's anus right here. This shit is deep. Went to that tenderloin. Nothing tender about that motherfucker at all. That shit was rough. The opposite of tender. I have never seen crack smoke so casually before. These niggas were sitting in front of Starbucks smoking crack and drinking coffee. I said, this is all for look. Talk about politics. I see one crack here trying to break into somebody's car. Man, it struck a chord. I tried to stop. I said, hey, and he looked back and saw me and said, oh, keep it out. It's a nigga that was me that said that. I'm trying to help you. I want this shit to stop. Crack here is a like that. I had a crack here break my car window one time. Broke it. You know he stole fucking candy ball. I had a line on it and say this all he took. The goddamn candy ball. I was so mad. I drove around in neighborhood for five hours. Looking for a crack here but chocolate on his face. I did that. I finally found my favorite motherfucker. I said, hey man. What's all this chocolate on your face? Motherfucker. He looked confused chocolate. This is dude-oo, baby. I said, ah. Oh, man. This place is insane. But you know what I like about saying, friend, and the reason I picked this city to do my special is because if all the major cities in America somehow people get along here better than anywhere else I've seen in the country, that's right. That's right. And I always admire saying, friend, for that. And today I've realized how you did it. Put all the nigs on the other side of that bridge. There's nothing that's shit that ain't happening on that side. You leave your sandwich sister like, boy, thanks for coming to San Francisco. Come back in April we're having a sale on Birkenstocks. Since we get to the other side, well when I'm going bitch. Quick. Thanks. It's fucking crazy. But it also feel like it's the East Coast city in the West Coast. You guys got subways and shit. I'm scared of public transportation. I was on a bus that was held hostage. 45 minutes. It wasn't like for it and I don't want to give you that impression. It was a dude jerking off but the shit was scary son. Who's scary? It was right before it happened I was on the bus smoking a cigarette. It's a long story. It's not the coolest shit I ever did and people freaked out. Sir! Sir put that goddamn cigarette out okay? Everybody's air sir. I picked it. I didn't want any trouble. Just in that moment coincidentally this home was due. I don't know where it pulls the dick out. Started beating off and I was furious. Because nobody said shit to this guy they were just looking like. God. I was the only one on the bus that had the balls and the same thing to him. And it's not even like I was brave really. It was that you know. I was sitting next to the motherfucker. I had to say something. Come on dog you hitting my elbows. Son of a stop. It's all I said I don't want to say too much. Guys beating off on the bus means something wrong with this motherfucker. He's not wrapped so tight I didn't want to push him over the edge. As soon as I said something all these dummies on the bus now they're brave. Oh he's right. Put your goddamn cock away. I don't want to see this anymore. I don't want to see it either. Yeah. Not a guy flips out. All right everybody back up. Back up up up. I tried to be nice about this. Now everybody freaks out. Oh my god. It's a biological take off. I'm caught in the middle. I can't lose my cool. I said hey everybody calm the fuck down. You don't get me shocked. It's all just be cool. Let's do what this man says. So he'll leave his own. Now everybody gets quiet. That's better. That is better. And then he started walking up and down the house. There's terror as in us. And then he starts making demands. You and the pink shirt. Squares are tips together. Oh god no. No. You stick your finger in your butt. Oh god what is this happening? Oh god. He was working my way. Shit was tight. Just that minute. I got saved. I was so lucky. This guy, the other end of the bus, he snapped. He lost his mind. I seen it happen. Ah. Screamed out. Grash him. He can't come on all of us and charge him out. Ah. And there's like a movie that's home to the dude. He's seen him coming. Shot one all. Ah. I thought it was actually like the Matrix. Look at all. You got behind me. Wasn't so lucky. No. I said it was gross. It didn't kill him but it was. I didn't sure that fuck this day up. I'm not going to have no idea if the home is dude. Bus the none of your forehead and eight thirty in the morning. That's a wrap on the rest of the day. Ah. This guy was freaking out. It burns. Oh. Oh. Everyone's standing around looking. Even the home is dude felt bad. I guess he was finished. He came back to his senses. Oh. This is my stuff. I said relax. I'm on the fuck ahead and say something. Relax. I got to know it. I said you can't get AIDS from the home's dude. Bus the none of your forehead. It's not how it spreads. I don't even know if that's true. That's just what I told him man. He was so scared I had to say something. I'm the way AIDS comes from. Who the fuck knows. Scientists don't even know. Scientists still say AIDS started because somebody had sex with a monkey. Word. After all this research is the best explanation that she came up with. Nobody fucks monkeys and people you idiot. You either fuck monkeys or you fuck people. That's it. There's no end between it. You're not going to get some monkey pussy on Tuesday and then be like, I'll let me call Charlene on Thursday. Once you fuck a monkey that's a firm decision. I'm out of the human pussy game for good. It's ridiculous. You act like monkeys are just as open as waiting for people to fuck. But the monkeys don't want to be fucked by people. Think about it. Think how hard it would be to catch a monkey. And fuck it. That's ridiculous. That's how it had to go. You think you're just going to walk up to him in the woods and grab this nigga with fruits and bananas? Hey buddy. Hey. Yeah. There you go buddy. Yeah. Yeah. Here you go. Your big bright red ass. It's a big bright red booty. You know how strong a monkey is? With a rip you dig old like the celery stalker's psh. Throw that shit in the tall grass. It'll never be seen again. Hey, doll. We're going to go to the club. Pick up some girls who are trying to row. Nah man, I'm cool. I'm going to stay home, doll. Chill with my monkey. You know how long it took me to train this monkey to suck my dick without peeling it? Last night, chim chim jerked me off with his feet. I think only a monkey can show you that kind of love and tenderness. So y'all keep fucking these people if you won't make this monkey pussy for me. Hook it up with an orangutane next week. That's all I fuckers. Chimps and orangutans. No, I feel real bad for his Indians. Everybody feels bad for Indians. They get doled openly because everybody thinks they're dead. These motherfuckers are not all dead, all right? I've seen with my own eyes I've seen a gathering of 1500 Native Americans. They were all gathered in one place. The place is called Walmart, New Mexico. I've never seen Indians before. I wasn't even sure if they were Indians. I fucked up, but I asked one of them. It's not nice, but I've seen them in the sports section looking at bows and arrows. They're saying something. Oh, excuse me. I don't mean to be rude. Are you Indian? And he was cool. Yes. Yes, I'm Indian. Still didn't believe him. I had to test him to be sure. This is fucked up. But I had a gum wrapper in my pocket. So I balled that shit up and I threw it on the floor. And a single tear came out of the ass and I said, oh shit. I had so many questions. What trap are you from? I am a Navajo. I said, it worked. I studied you in social studies. You're a hunter-gatherer, correct? I said, I guess so. That's what you wish to call it. I said, why, what do you call it? I said, I am an alcoholic. I said, what's your name, dog? He said, please. Dog is my cousin. That's a good guess. My name is Ronan Coyote. What is your name, friend? And that shit called me off-guard. I didn't want to say my name was Dave, two motherfuckin' names, Ronan Coyote. This don't feel good enough. He was putting me on the spot. I said, huh? My name's black. Oh, my name's Blackfeet. Then I changed the subject. Forget about me. What's going on with you? You need to eat your chief. Why don't you and your chief and your friends get together tonight? We could have a real-life piece pipe smoke and ritual. We need to celebrate. And I thought you were dead. And he set it up. It was beautiful. It was just like I dreamed. It was all sitting around. And then he was beating the drum. Other Indians came out the back with a long blanket that was folded in half and put it in front of us. And then he opened that shit up. And on the blanket was a long wooden pipe with feathers. And bags of weed were all over the blanket. Chief walked over. The big ones are 50. The little ones are 25. And these are 10. Men and Indians got high as shit. I was beggining. I told the chief. He was talking. I cut him off. Time out, chief. Sorry in the rub. Fucking smash, man. The weeds too strong. I'm injured. Is this piece repeated? The spirits have got me. Chief, the spirits have got me. And the chief threw some water in my face. Calm down, blackface. Splash. I said, hey, is Blackfeet motherfuckin' take it easy? Blackfeet. You're a welcome to stay amongst me and my tribe for the night. Until the spirits leave you. And they gave me my own TP to sleep in. Which sounds nice. I personally felt like it was a little fucked up. You know, because they all had houses, man. It's like, why can't I sleep? We're showin' a house and watch TV. They got to keep ya on this grayish all night. And he ends the room, man. Everybody's room. And he ends the eating nasty food. All they ate was corn and shit. Doritos, the thing they call. That's great. People only see the surface. They see the division in our foods. Just because I eat chicken and watermelon. They think that that's some wrong with me. Let me take some. If you don't like chicken or watermelon, something's wrong with you motherfuckin' There's something wrong with you. Where are all these people that don't like chicken and watermelon? I'm sick of hearing about how bad it is. It's great. I'm waiting for chicken to approach me to do a commercial. And they got all good... Now, do it for free, chicken. At least I can do it. They make fun of Latin people for eating... Which, y'all eat beans, rice, corn. Listen, that's not a reason to hate a motherfucker. It's funny, but it's not a reason to hate. The only reason these things are even an issue is because nobody knows what white people eat. You've been very good at keeping that shit a secret amongst the sales. I study white people. You don't know that. I'm writing a paper on you. Not even for school. Just to do it. Just to get some food. Doing independent research. Spending my money is why I'm working so hard. I follow you around grocery stores. They freak out. I just try to peek in the cart. They always say, get away from my cart, everybody look at. Chicken and giblets are over there. You must be lost. These are vegetables. I know what you drink. See how quiet I got. Great juice. Surprise motherfuckers. You didn't know I knew about grape juice, did you? Oh, no play dumb with me. Look at what? A lot of black people don't have the privilege of knowing about grape juice. Because they have grape drink. It's not the same formula that you give. Ain't no vitamins in that shit. You might have one of your black friends over Todd. Todd? Would you care for a glass of grape juice? What? Look at what the fuck is juice? I want some grape drink, baby. Oh, it's purple. I don't think I know what a grape drink is. What? I have some apple juice. If you want what the fuck is juice? I want some apple drink. Scream. Remember that commercial for Sunday to Light? When all the kids run in from outside playing, they all run to the fridge. All right. I got some purple stuff, some sunny deep. As soon as they say sunny deep, all the kids go, yeah! Watch the black kid in the back. If you ever see that commercial, look at that black kid. He'll be like, I want that purple stuff. And that's drink, make that is drink. They want drink. When I want him vitamins, make that drink. Sugar, water, purple. That's ingredient, sugar, water. And of course, purple. It's too fucking much. I got a lot of things to talk about tonight. First of all, I've stopped smoking weed. When black people, you didn't let me finish, my motherfucker. It's goddamn. I'm sorry black people to break the news so publicly, but I can't smoke with you anymore. At the time I smoked weed with my black friends, all you talk about is your trials and tribulations. I'm sick of that shit. I got my own problems. They're gonna say, waste the weed. I'm smoking weed to run away from my problems. I take only yours. Now on, I smoke weed exclusively with white people. Calm down, motherfucker. You win by default. You got good weed conversation. All white people talk about when they get hacked is other times that they got hacked. I can listen to that shit all night. Do you remember it, Franks last week? It's fucking smashed, man. And catalogs, everything they drink. It's too short, seeyeager. Kill, four-bong hitsman. Beer, cheeseburger. That shit is great. Only bad part is you cannot pass out around white people. Every time white dudes pass out around each other, they always do some boredom, man. Gay shit when the guys are sleeping. Frank fell asleep so we stuck a keratin' ass in it. To shave and cream on his balls. Why, motherfucker? Why did you do that to a friend of yours? He trusted you enough to sleep around. You're gonna put a keratin' ass in that nice. I'll tell you right now, if I put a keratin' of black dudes out there, you will kill you when he wakes up for some shit like that. That is an automatic bed sentence on the street. So rat for you, I'm gonna kill that motherfucker. I thought y'all was friends, baby. What happened? I fell asleep at his house, right? We was drinking, and I fell asleep at his house, and while I was sleeping, right? I'm just gonna kill that motherfucker, all right? That's all you need to know. Fuck carrots. But everybody's getting along. I see that shit. I see it all around. Blacks and whites don't fight so much. You know who don't have no beef with anybody is Asian people. I see how y'all be doing. Y'all just laying the cut. All people are Asian people beef with is other Asian people. Like if you call a Korean guy Chinese, I've done this. They will flip out. Hey! Let's make a think of Chinese. I am Korean. I look Chinese. Yes, motherfucker, you do look Chinese. That's why I said it. It's accident. Look at the untrained eye. You all look Chinese to me. It's a mistake. I'm not trying to offend you. Some people say all black people look alike. We don't get bin out of shape. We normally just call those people police. Okay? Just learn to live with them. That's all I can tell. Everybody is afraid of police now. I'm scared of death of these police. I am. I got a police scandal. First money. I got this a first and I went out. But when I bought me a police scandal, I just listened to these motherfuckers. Before I go out. Just to make sure everything is cool. You hear shit on it. Calling all cars. Calling all cars. Be on the lookout for a black male between 4-7 and 6-8. Staying in the crib tonight. Fuck that. That work on that alibi for a minute. Every black person needs alibi. I do them impromptu joints. If I'm by myself and need to out, I just open up the windows and apartment. Turn on lights on. Stop beating all of Friday and the window. Look at me. Hey everybody look, this is me. They should pay on praise. I'm jerking all over. Nope the time motherfuckers is 2.35. Look at me. I'm jerking all over the window. 2.35. I'm jerking all over the window. 2.35. Community days you pay all those junk stamps. Nope the time. That shit could save my life. Officer David Shapel couldn't have done that. I saw him in his window masturbating. From 2.35 to 2.37. I'm certain of it. He was standing on a clock and holding a calendar and today's paper. Fuck I need alibi. I can't be no celebrity shit. I can't be no celebrity shit is just the worst. I'm seeing it. I can see why I see why stars are crazy. These motherfuckers. I want to diss me world of my kids, which is a big deal for me. I don't get to see my kids so much. I do Shapel show. 20 hours a day. Sleep for like half an hour. Raise my kids for 10 to 20 minutes. And not go back to work. Now. This particular day I got to hook up with the kids we went to business. We're everybody at the park. Fucking everybody. Hey, hey, Rick James bitch. Hey, Rick James bitch. It's like, hey man, hey. You might not call me a bitch in front of my kids. Time out motherfuckers. We take it they all. Even Mickey Mouse did it. I said, this is the most unprofessional shit I have ever seen in my life. Rick James bitch. Oh, I was fed up. I caught that motherfucker with the uppercut. Bop. Knocked his head clean off. Everybody was screaming. Oh my god. Oh my god. Mickey Mouse is Mexican. I had terrible time in Disney World. Disney World is like a whole other country anyway. They got their own currency. That shit is ridiculous. As soon as I check in the hotels, welcome to Disney World. Mr. Chappelle can we interest you in some Disney dollars? Nah, man, I'm cool. Can't buy weed and pussy with Disney dollars. I'm on vacation. I like them greenbacks. I like them greenbacks. I'm saying there's a kind of money people spend. People is very particular about that. I saw that. That was one of the main stories from the war. It was the first big thing we did. It was a sad story. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. I saw that. They did. Now that I retired, we have managed to take Hitom who say face off of the money. The press conference was shocked. I was really proud to find an American because that's a very subtle psychological new wanted to have a dictate on his money. It is thoughtful to take off every ever else. If you can do that, I'll write something down here. What about our money, man? Our money looked like baseball, cause we slave homes on. George Washington is the worst, the worst. Yes, I said it. You mythologized as a motherfucker. He was the greatest dude, man. If I went back in time with a white person and we saw George Washington walking in front of our time machine, my wife from would probably be like, oh my god, Dave, look, there's George Washington. He tends to father of this great nation, and go shake his hand. I'd be on the other side like, run, nigga, George Washington. And we both be right. You like him because he wrote the Declaration of Independence and all that shit. We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men are created equal. Go give me a sandwich, nigga, I'll kill you. Liberty, justice for all. Am I wrong? Am I wrong? Wait a minute, did he not own slaves, did he own slaves? That's why I saw him saying it. I almost protested at the war in the beginning. Almost. I tell you I saw what happened to him, Dixie Chicks. I say, fuck that. If they'll do that to three white women, they will tear my black ass to pieces. I don't wanna hear that shit. Yeah, man, they would. But I'm like, for real, why? Why do you care so much with the Dixie Chicks? It's not like they political scientists, and they just bitch, they can sing good. You know what I mean? Stop worshipping the celebrity so much. Just don't listen, pay attention. I remember right around September 11th, the job rule was on MTV. They said, we got job rule on the phone. Let's see what jobs thoughts are on this tragedy. Who gets a fuck with job rule things at a time like this? This is ridiculous. I don't wanna dance, I'm scared to death. I want some answers to job rule, right? Not have right now. I think when bad shit happens to me, I'll be in a crib like, oh my god, this is terrible. Because somebody, please, find job rule, get hold of this motherfucker, because I can make sense of all this. Where is job? I have me job rule. I don't even know why people listen to me. I'll say anything, Nick, I've done commercials for Coke and Pepsi. I don't give a fuck, what comes out of my mind? By the say what it takes, whatever it takes, that's what I'm saying. If you wanna know the truth, can't even taste the difference. Surprise! I know it was Pepsi paid the most recently, so taste better. It's pretty much how the game goes. I'm just being real, man. There's too much goo-gog and over-seller, but people don't know it was fake and what's real anymore. That's why Bill Cosby got in trouble. Look what happened to Bill Cosby. Bill Cosby says some real shit and the whole world freaked out on him. For what? For having an opinion, just because he was selling puttin' pots for the last 40 years, people forget that he's the nigga from Philly in the projects, and he might say some real shit from time. It's not that big of a deal. I spoke at my old high school and I told him, Kia is straight up. If you guys are serious about making it out of this ghetto, you gotta focus. You gotta stop blaming white people for your problems. And you've gotta learn how to rap, play basketball or something. Making your track, you are trapped. Either do that or sell crap. That's your only option. That's the only way I've ever seen it work. Better get the entertaining news white people. Make a good, that dancing. Go on out there and be somebody. I just hope they listen. Shit is ridiculous. You know, if you watch a movie, say you watch a movie and one character says that no character says, what's your number, man? What's the other character always say? 555, 5555. You know why we gotta do that? Because stupid ass people go to the movies and then go home and try to call the characters that they just saw. Hello, because there's any other gentlemen here? No motherfuckin' fake, it's not his number. And to be honest, this is the worst time in history to be a black celebrity. Fuck, they lockin' all our stars up. It's hot right now for black celebrities. I knew it was bad when Kobe got in trouble. I said, this is a rap fuss. He's one of the most wholesome dudes we had. Lockin' up everything. Kobe kept it together. Thank God he held his game together because if he was cracking under pressure and getting like six points of game, the whole LL would have been like, that nigger is guilty. Kobe was playing his ASO. He was playing like his freedom depended on that shit. You see that some motherfuckin' him game? This nigger's trying to beat that case on the court. I'm a star. Like the judge threw him in the ball like, play for your freedom. If I could talk to Kobe, I'd be just relaxed. You'll be fine, man, because the public is still giving Kobe the benefit of the doubt. He's one of the few black celebrities that get that. Not because he's a celebrity, more because, you know, the girl showed up with eight different savings to the investigation. You can't do that. That's seven too many. That's a lot of savings, man. That's seven too many. That's a lot of savings, man, because you got no one's arc on a pan is... I wish you're trying to recreate who man it is. She's a collector. She got every unsolved mystery the answer might be in this girl's pan. I had the first place I looked. OJ's other gloves in there. Bigfoot's footprint. Three CSI reruns in it, motherfucker. You got the most damn boggled draws ever. Fuck me in a celebrity. It's not the time to be a black star. They locking all our stars up. Black celebrities, this is the witch hunt for us, man. God damn it. It's all OJ's fault. Ever since OJ got away, why have people just been locking up our stars one by one? It's true. And it's all... It's not even OJ's fault. It's all fault. We celebrated too openly when OJ got acquitted. We should have been quiet about that shit. Susan Knock guilty. Nick was your name? Oh, and your face, Nick and your face. Perth's throwing at her. Burns, damn it. And good at justice system. Burns, damn it. Welcome to my world, motherfucker. All that shit. Why have people wanted OJ's ass, bad? City LA spent over $12 million just trying at motherfucker. And the look on white people's face when he was acquitted, priceless. Priceless. And that's why I don't trip all the banners to the evidence. I don't like it. I don't trust it. There's one minute they all love you. The next thing you know. In front of that courthouse dancing on top of a car, just trying to figure out the fuck happened to you. What was I waiting for? Because the time in this Michael Jackson shit is what makes me doubt it. Every time his war is going out of control, the economy gets bad or something is wrong with the world at large, it's always these moments in history that Michael Jackson will pay. Michael Jackson will coincidentally. Jericho Alphakeed is just getting ridiculous. Are you planning this shit? Do you have meetings? Michael, thank you for coming. As you know, Michael, the war has not been going as well as we expected. There's been a lot of hiccups and the public is asking us a lot of questions, of course, and. Well, Michael, there's no nice way to say this and I know how to do his beat directs. Let me just beat direct. We're going to need you to jerk off another child, Mike. I'm sorry. I am sorry. But it wouldn't really help out. Or maybe he did it. Who knows? Who knows? That's the thing. That's what I wanted to say. Who knows? Who the fuck knows? Mike, God, and this little boy known. That's about it. That's about it. The only reason that I can even talk about this shit is because everybody is speculating. They all think he did it. And I don't think he did it. I'm alone in this. I don't think he did it. I'm not going to say I don't think he did it. That's too strong. Let me just say I am a reserving judgment. Until all the facts come out. It was so far from what I heard. I mean, the kids said he's dying of cancer. He was in Make-A-Wish Foundation. He had two weeks to live. And it was his dying wish to meet Michael Jackson. Come on, man. Give me a fucking break. His kid is 10 years old. He don't remember Thriller. The fuck you want to meet Michael Jackson for, honestly. I remember Thriller. And I just like, kind of want to meet this nigga. I wouldn't break an appointment with him. I put it that way. I'd have to already be free. That's ridiculous. That's like if I'm dying in two weeks and go, I'm gonna get me in a room with Chubby Chaco. I wouldn't want to meet that man with the fuck on that. My last two weeks. Why not usher somebody like this? So then the kid claims he goes to Michael's house. This is where it all gets crazy. I don't like, you know, he does everything you'd expect at Michael's house. They climb trees and rode rollercoasters and Ferris wheels. The chef made cookies, pies, and cakes. They was petting them all here in the draft. Saying, songs, kids shit. And in the middle of all this chat like activity, for some reason, Mike pulled out some wine and some pills. And sucked this kid's dick. Folks, it hurts me to say it. And the kid had the nerve to call that abuse. The fuck of that is a good, host guy. What else do you want? What else do you want? I'm not gonna get a glass of rake drink in my friend's house. Alone with Rokos riding my dick sucked. Mike must be confused like I brought you in my house. I fed you. I sucked your dick. And this is how you repay me, motherfuckers. This was your wish, not man. Thought you were dying in two weeks. What happened to that, mother? I've been in court for a year and a half because strong every time I see you. This is fucked up. I shouldn't even say this fuck. Wouldn't be some ironic shit if they found out through this case that the cure for cancer was Michael Jackson sucking your dick sometimes. If Mike had powers like Green Mile and all the kids like, what's up guys? I never again. You need an appreciated. Can we at least study your saliva? Please, Mike. He's just done stop, though. This doesn't stop. And the only reason I can talk about Mike is because he's a freak. He's a freak. That's why people let you talk about it. I brought up Catholic priest fucking kids that don't get quiet as shit. But when Michael Jackson does it just okay because he's a freak. His face is all cut up. But just remember when you look at that thing that he calls his face, that he did that for you somehow. Somehow he thought maybe it'll help. Maybe people who like me more, if I turn myself into a white, I don't know what the fuck it is, but he did it for you. And I appreciate the gesture, Michael Jackson, if you're watching this, I appreciate that gesture. And I want you to know, fuck everybody, they should pale understands. Because you want to know something? I'm getting some work done. Surprise, yes. Nothing major. You would never know if I didn't tell you, but it's some shit I'm insecure about that I want to work on. If you must know, I'm getting boat talks done on my balls to get these wrinkles out. Finally, we have these just smoothest eggs. No, I can't wait. I cannot wait. And I'm not stopping there. That's just phase one, baby. You'll be like Bob Villa, these old balls. I'm fixing them up. I'm plucking all the hair out. I got to make room. I know this. I got to make room. I'm going to tattoo a gangster ass face on me and expressions like this. Then I wrote a hair back on the bottom so they got beard like me. Then I'm hitting that beach and looking for balls suckers. I'm going to wear some high shorts just like this. And walk up the women with a confidence I've never had before. Pardon me, Miss. I don't mean to be rude. But do you suck balls? Excuse me. Miss relax. You didn't even let me finish. Do you suck these balls? Oh my god, those balls are as smooth as eggs. Yes, I'll suck them. I played this scenario out in my man, a million times lady. That's how it always ends. Yes, I'll suck those balls. All our stars. All our stars, man. Our Kelly pissed on his victim. I know, it was rough. But I mean, again, I can't even judge our Kelly. First of all, we don't know these allegations are true. If you want to know how I feel about it, honestly, if a man cannot pee on his fans, I don't want to be in show business anymore. Well, that's why I got in the game. Baby, I got dreams too. You guys are confusing the issue. Why you guys are busy worrying about if our Kelly even peed on this girl and I? You're not asking yourself the real question. That American needs to decide once and for all. And the only thing is how old is 15 really? Oh, that's a good question. That's a good question. I'm not saying that a person is as smart as they're going to be at 15. That's not what I'm saying, man. But I am saying 15 to me is old enough to decide whether or not you want to be pissed on. I mean, that's me. If you can't make a decision like that by the time you're 15, then just give up motherfucker because life is way harder than that. I make tougher decisions all the time. If you don't want to get pissed, then I want to just get the fuck out of the way. It's not even a decision. If I start peeing on the front row, they're not going to have to calculate and think, how do I feel about this? Am I okay with it? They just move. You can do that at 15. I could have. I bet 15. When I was 15, I was doing stand-up in night clubs. I smoked a rafel from time to time. Friends were selling crack. I was trying to finger fuck people. I knew what was happening around me to some degree. Getting pissed on was the least of my worries at 15. Trust me. But it keeps coming up. It's a lot of confusion around that age. Anytime 15 comes up, people freak out. Like when that girl Elizabeth Smart got kidnapped. Right? Remember when you told last year's 15-year-old girl Elizabeth Smart was kidnapped? And then they finally found her and the whole country was relieved. And I was the only one saying damn. She wasn't that smart after all. Not because she got kidnapped. That could happen to anybody. I'm not going to for that. I'm just saying if you kidnapped me when I was 15, you got to take me further than eight miles away from my house. Man, God damn. Can't hold me prison around. Shit, I recognize. I'll break away. I'll break away. Fuck off me. That's my bus stop. I know I'm mad. I'm going home. She was missing for six months, eight miles away from my house. That's two exits, man. That's nothing. And while she was missing during this half a year that this girl was missing, there's a seven-year-old black girl who gets kidnapped and fill a delphy. Nobody knows her name. They might have talked about it two or three times on the news, but she should have been the top store. Because she chewed through the ropes and had both of these motherfuckers in jail. And 45 minutes flat. Seven years old. I'm not making this up. There's two crack heads kidnapped and took them back to the crack house and tied her up. And then they left her. There's a crack heads. I got to make moves, crack smoke, chocolate, eat. These motherfuckers made moves. It was out. But as soon as they left, this little girl got the nibbun. She was kidnapped at four o'clock and at home watching herself on news at 5.30. That shit is crazy. That's a news store. That is a news store. Now, meanwhile in Utah, 15-year-old Elizabeth's smarts captors left her alone too. And they didn't even tie her up because they're here at Bill East. They just bounced. Don't try to escape, bitch, or will kill you. Be right back. I believe she's 15 sitting in the house by herself. Oh, am I going to get out of this? Come on, Elizabeth, think. Think Elizabeth, how am I going to get out of here? Why don't you just open the fucking door and go outside? Have you thought about that? Do you have a quarter? Do you know your phone number? Your 15-bitch run? Stop thinking and stop making moves. I know I sound mean. I don't know what the people are thinking when I'm saying this. Dave, she's only 15. All right. But that's the discrepancy because when you talk about a little girl like Elizabeth's smart, then the country feels like 15 is so young and so innocent. On the flip side, here comes 15 again. Now we talk about a 15-year-old black kid in Florida. This black kid accidentally killed his neighbor when he's practicing wrestling moves that he's on TV. Now, was he a kid? Oh, they gave him life. They always try 15-year-olds as adults. There's no one he was doing. It's a goddamn pile driver. This kid gets on the ropes. There's no stopping him. You'd have to send a rock to a restaurant. And they gave him 15-year-old boy, Life and Jail. If you think that it's okay to give him life and jail, then it should be legal to pee on him. That's all I'm saying. You got to make up your mind across the board. How old 15 actually is? That's all I'm saying. So I'm going to tell you right now, if somebody comes in here and puts a gun in my head, and says, Shapali, you got a choice to make. You're either going to jail for a month or we'll let you go, but you got to let R. Kelly pee on you. I'm not hesitating. Bring in R. Kelly and tell him to stay away from my ass. I'd rather get pissed on on the outside and fucking the butt on the insats. I can't go to jail with some smooth Botox balls and think everything's going to be all right. It's not that kind of place. Taking my chance with that pissed a wash off with a 10-minute shower, I'm certain of it. This piss is coming right out. What can I do? They're going to put me in jail. Sad is changing rapidly. Can't smoke indoors. The fuck was that all about? I got kicked out of titty-buff smoke. No, that shit was ridiculous. It's the stripper did it. The stripper came up like, you're smoking as a health risk for me. I don't want to work on this kind of environment. Spitchy have your gunnery and fussy pussy in my face. You started it. They threw me out. It's the dirtiest place I've ever been thrown out of and just a given idea of what I mean by dirty. Lap dances at this place. Three dollars. It's fucking disgusting. And at the same time, who could pass up a sale? Son, it was three dollars. Of course I did it. Only 12 quarters. Said I'll break a fire for that. I've never seen somebody work this hot for three dollars. This lady must have been a throwback to the Great Depression. She was all over me. It's the first time I ever told a stripper to get off me. All right. Yeah, thank you very much, miss. Thank you. That'll be all. That's enough thinking. Hey! Hey, get off of me! Whatever happened to lipstick on the collar lady? I have a shit streak on the middle of my shirt. How the fuck am I going to explain this when I get home? Huh? Oh no, baby. Me and Bob were playing basketball and Bob Dunk on me was hanging on the rim and his pants fell down. I was checking them clothes. I think he was swinging. And his butt cheeks might, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, his butt cheeks, I think, caught my shirt. I don't know why I was playing ball in my dress shirt. It was midnight. I don't know what the fuck. Just let me think. That's what, that's what you know guys, Slian, if you say shit like that. Hold on, just let me think. We may not have stayed at Teeve. Hold on, that's just a methane farm, man. Can I think? Can I think? We all win, man. You guys, you guys, you guys just made too much progress, too fast. Not too much, but you just, you confused by, you made so much progress, you even confused. Man, I ain't women. We both, like, what the fuck just happened? Because women got all of this money now, but they still like women. Like, oh, you never take me anywhere anymore. And it do be thinking, bitch, you got more money than me. You never take me anywhere anymore. And at the same time, you don't treat a man like a man. You don't cook. You don't clean. And you don't do anything, or motherfuckers say it. You tell them motherfuckers what, do I see women doing this to men all the time? Come on! Oh, man, what's that shit? So, when anybody that tells me what to do that much, you got to work with me. Like, if it makes a man feel like a man to watch the game, then just let them sit down and watch the game for a minute. And if he happens to look over it, she won't be watching the game. Don't look at him all mean and make him feel guilty about watching it. Just pick up your own titties and suck it. Just try it out. He will instantly remember why he fell in love. Oh, that's right. So, that night, girl sucks on own titties from time to time. I can't walk away from that. It's too hard to find. You see that, took 20 seconds. You're still gonna be as busy as you want. Just suck your own titties and everything's cool. Well, how about this? If you make a love to your man, you already make a love. My husband will spice it up, right? How about this? I personally like it. I like it when a girl tells me where to come. I don't like it when a girl tells me when to come. I hate that shit. Don't come here. Oh, bitch, all these rules! And instead of doing that, why don't you just tell us where? It's make us feel better, especially if you're aggressive about it. I like when a girl gets wow. Come in my face! Stick your chin out like a boxer. Bring it on, motherfucker! There are a bomb! But it doesn't have to be that wild or explicit. That's a... Look, all the maintenance in those that you're interested in that you participate. You can say anything, he'll be happy. Oh, oh, oh. Come on top of the television. All right, but... The weirder, the place is better. Oh, come in my fishbowl. Damn, fishbowl. Oh, shit, the eatin' it all! Fish love it when I come over. Oh, is that guy we're having chicken tonight? You guys, man, thanks, man. It's been the best year of my career. By fall. I appreciate you guys watching me. Can I do for my kids, brother? And my kids off the hook. You can think I'm a bad motherfucker. Wait till you see the 2000 model, should I peel this? Nega is off the hook! I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. The hook! My son's a bad! My oldest son is three. Nega made me a necklace out of macaroni. I said, this shit is a baller. He painted the macaroni green and put it on a string. He tied it on my neck and he told me he was proud of me. And I got choked up. And he thought I was sad. It's how smart he was. He says, like, you say it, Daddy. And I said, no. I'm not sad. He's too young to understand his son. But this is fuckin' crazy. You used to live in my balls, man. Now you making jewelry out of macaroni or bad motherfucker. Long live Chappell's. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Oh, shit. Thanks, guys. Thank you. That's what it's all about. Everybody usually wants to be famous so they can rock nice jewelry on that shit. They already got them macaroni necklace. I got valuable shit. I got valuable shit. I got valuable shit. Not in it for that. Only kind of shit I want to do with fame is like decadent as I want to go to Vegas to the $5,000 blackjack tape. And I don't even want to play. I just want to be such a big star that I could go up to one of the players in a tight hand and put my dick on this show. And I'm such a celebrity. They think it's funny. Hey, what the fuck? Oh, shit. Dave Chappell. God. Get on the cell phone. You are not going to believe whose dick is on my shoulder. And this guy's balls are smooth as eggs. He's had some work. Couldn't thank you enough. That bless you, old man. Keep watching. I'm going to try to make it interesting. Stay safe. I'm rich, bitch.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Doug Stanhope. Thanks. Thanks very much. For public release on Saturday night, May 25th, while performing in Las Vegas, I made comments and performed material that I now understand to be utterly deplorable and indefensible. It is now a source of great shame and embarrassment, and I want to offer my heartfelt apologies. I am gutted by my own carelessness and beg you to know, deliver earnestly. This is not who I am. I intend to take the time in the future for great soul searching and hope to come back a more sensitive and insightful human being. I only wish there was some way I could go back in time and erase this whole ugly affair. I like to get ahead of problems. I decide I am going to do this show backwards, where I am going to open with what I was going to use as my closer, but my closer I really like. It is about dead kids, and that makes me happy, and it sets a tone for the entire show. I go, yeah, let's do it that way. Perks me up in the beginning. I will tell you, there used to be in any given recording or special or whatever the fuck you call them, a large portion, not a large, but a certain percentage of my material was based on cable news. I watched on CNN or whatever cable news, and I don't have that anymore, because since the election there is only one fucking subject on cable news anymore. It is just that one boring fucking story that I don't care about. I have nothing to add to. I never even say his name on stage. I just ignore it. It is your fucking problem. You deserve that fucking guy, because you are the generation that made this happen. You are responsible for making all these talentless blowhards, famous, just for being fucking assholes, and now you got one that you called your leader. So fuck you, none of my business. I will be dead soon. But where it became a deficit to me, I remember right before the election, there was a story about a family at Disney World. There was an enjoying a vacation, and they were having a nice picnic at the end of the day on a fake beach at a fake lake at Disney World, or it probably a fake sunset to... The little toddler boy in the family wandered out into the drink just a little bit, and a real alligator sprung out and ate the boy, which the dad probably thought was fake too, after a whole day at Disney Landy. Now there is no surprises for me anymore, real alligator. Oh fuck, that's my boy, it's a real alligator. So the dad, he grabbed the boy by the wrists, but by now the alligator has the boy up past the feet, past the waist, and as they say in the business, possession is 9-10ths of the law. And that has to be a very emasculating, devastating experience where you have to concede defeat in a tug of war with an alligator when your boy is the rope, like, I can't fuck. But you try it, honey, it's a goddamn alligator. The fuck am I supposed to... This whole vacation was your idea. I'm not responsible for... I tried my best, and it was like weeks after that story, I remember watching that at 2 in the morning, and then the election happens, and then that's all they talk about. All the cable news. Oh, did you see what he tweeted this week? That contradicts what he tweeted last week. Let's have a panel of 8 eggheads all sit out here and discuss this for an entire hour. So, city, apologize. What's your opinion, Brian? Well, you know my opinion, because of the network we're on. We all have the same fucking opinion. How many kids being eaten by alligator stories? Am I missing? Because it is fucking onion head in office. I have a business to run people. So now I just get all my news off the internet so I can read the headline, make sure it's not about that guy. I don't know if I fixate on dead kid stories because of that alligator thing, or maybe I just have a weird dark interest in dead kid stories. But every, I click on all the dead kid stories because they're always interesting. They're always tragic. And necessarily, I've never read a dead kid story where at the end I felt justice. Yeah, it coming. You're prick. How many times did your dad warn you not to talk on the cell phone in the tub while it's charging? No, they're all tragic. But one of the patterns I've noticed is almost every dead kid story ends with, and the family has set up a guy. And then I go fund me page. For what? I don't know anything about what it's like to lose a child. But if there's one thing I do know if nothing else, you're making money. A lot of money. Shint loads of money. The littler, the kid, the more money you're making, because now all that money you no longer have to spend on the big boy pea pants and the lunchables and the juice boxes. That's your penny cash coming right back into your pockets. All the pop Warner gear and the air Jordans. And the tuba lessons that's your fucking money is racing back into your back cacky pockets. The orthodontist, the antitha came straight out at you. No longer your concern. That's your bank. It's like you're in one of those phone booths on a game show where cash blows all around and you get to snatch as much out of the air as you possibly can. And you're going to start a go fund me page on top of that. You greedy cocksucker playing on the sympathies of your friends and neighbors. You robber baron, you road agents, you you have a little kid that dies. You start a go fund someone else page and pay it forward. Share the wealth. You have a friend that has a little kid that dies. Jack him up for alone. That's the day. Day one before everyone else gets to him. Sorry, his awkwardness is seems Kevin. I heard you won a lottery of sorts. And I don't know if you heard about the predicament I'm in. I'm in a bit of a pickle. My kids are there's still alive. So it's tough times that the Jenkins household hate to show up with my hand out. The fuck do you need a go fund me for a dead kid. The only time I've seen it in a story is where it says to help pay for funeral costs, which is another scam all together a funeral. You just fucking. It's dead. It doesn't care. Dead things don't give a fuck about all your goings on and you're going to get a headstone and a coffin for what you're going to you're going to buy a cemetery plot for a dead kid. You're going to buy real estate for a dead thing while you're still renting. Does that make any sense at all? See how a little more energy this time huh? You have something that you loved that's now dead. That vessel is still sitting there. You donate it to science. It's where you do. You're fucking spend money on some nonsense. Dead things don't care about you. My parents both died and we donated both of their bodies to science because you can't shut it in a dumpster. It's illegal for some reason. You donate it to science and what happens then is you actually help the world. You donate it to science. They show up. They pick up your dead thing. They ship it off for you charge to a medical university where some hungover 19 year olds are going to gut open your aunt Betty and start flipping around her internal organs like it's a Benny Hanna. Chase each other around with your mom's pancreas. Quiddit. I'm going to hurl. Still drunk. But maybe one of those kids is actually paying attention and somehow your donated dead thing will he finds a cure for something for some disease or malady that actually helps society from your donation rather than you just being some weird corpse hoarder. And then you did a good thing for the world that kids Asian by the way. I know they say that there's no heartache worse than having to bury your own child and I have to give that to you. I wouldn't know. I've never been in that position and never put myself at that kind of disadvantage by having one. But if that is true that that's the worst heartache that proves my point that there's a huge difference between a child and a fetus because I never had to bury my own child but did have to pony up for an abortion when it was my turn to grab the check and heartache with an abortion. I could have watched live footage of that abortion on closed circuit TV while eating spaghetti and still gotten distracted and started checking my tweets. The only heartache you'll ever feel with an abortion is if you chugged the champagne too quickly afterwards. And if you started to go fun be page for an abortion I would kick in a few dollars and retweet that to my teacher followers because that is an effort worth investing in for the planet. I had to get that out that bit it's important it's dead kid season Memorial Day weekend kicks off dead kid season. You're going to get back from Vegas the sun's coming out whatever shit oil you live in and you're going to peel the tarp off of that above ground pool. You're going to start pouring the sangrias a little too heavy and a little too long and I didn't think I was that drunk but you stopped watching the gate and then all of a sudden little Kelsey is now bobbing around a little blue bob or that afternoon. Right beside the pool noodles and going to fire up the jet ski and zip Sarah around the lake and you didn't think you were that drunk and now she's all wrapped up in the propeller. Maybe that Asian student that was paying attention could figure out nerve propellers if you donate or decides. I don't know where you guys are from and I don't give a fuck but wherever you're going back to I'm sure I'm booked there eventually whatever harb it's so weird to be filming this at the plaza because I have been coming here by choice since before I even did comedy this is my this is my place this is my old school Vegas place. I'm fucking out. Oscars, steakhouse and even the worst parts of it I have to go I that's the reason I come here it's vintage fucking Vegas. I don't get to normally play any place that I want to be or you want to be at the same time. I usually have to play where you live and you're stuck and then I'm stuck there with you playing a sub fucking mall that is some hideous city. I just I had to I ate it out back steakhouse last week in a fucking mall and there was people there like are you comic too because unless you're stuck and that's the only thing walking distance why would you be in here out back steakhouse couldn't be less authentic if Jim Jeffries was your waiter. Sorry Jim I had to do it but that's what I do for a living I come visit you in fucking horrible places and then I'm stuck there for at least the day usually at an airport hotel some mid range like 2.5 star Beiges brownish she salmon colored in it's always an in like a days in or a comfort in or a quality in and they're all in a fucking row and you walk in and it's full of mid range 2.5 star folks doing dumb shit. It's a dance mom's competition this weekend and it is a bunch of kids in Ballerite outfits and fucking I'm using my roller bag as a cane coming in shit faced and there's kids pressing every button on the elevator because their parents can't afford six flags so this is a thrill ride for the kid to go up and down and you go don't hit the kid don't hit the kid it's not your kid. If you had your own kid you could beat your kid in effigy of that kid but it's not your kid. So don't hit the kid talk to the business man with the fucking land here these old convention here business fuck you look like Mitch McConnell and you have really bad small talk but a very large a land here they wear big land here it's around there. Northeast Arkansas assembly of special needs educators. You need a fucking backstage past that size to get into that 830 am 10 talk. I'm kidding I stole a croissant off your table in front of that fucking banquet room and I didn't need a pass I just stole a fucking thing. I think you're so important wake up in the morning and you're fighting old people for some humid lobby waffle in the morning for they shut it down. And then I go to the show after a day of reading tweets from you fucking animals. Pre-gaming for the Doug Steadhobe show tonight in Des Moines and it's a picture of you drinking wild turkey at 10 in the morning. Oh you're going to be a treasure to deal with the fucking 930 at night and then it's just a fist fight shut the fuck up yelling at you and I get back to my beige brown salamon colored hotel and the final insult as you get to your room and your key card. Fuck your mother fucker red light red light red light you fuck red red green light oh now goddamn and then I stop back like a giant baby down to the front desk to mother fuckers. And I just explode all of this shit all over some night auditor my key card doesn't work again. Big fucking screaming baby. I'm sorry sir did you have it near your cell phone or your credit card at any point probably. Yeah everyone's got cell phones and credit cards everywhere what do you mean by near my cell phone or credit card if it's here is that near that and what's the radius and you know what my cell phone and my credit cards still work so what the fuck is wrong with your key card. Sure if you just calm down I'm trying to help you what's your name in your room number stand hope 217. Clack clack clack clack clack clack. Sir I'm sorry there's no one by that name in this hotel look at the key card your mother fucking hampton in. Next door you all look the same fuck you I am not apologizing you all look the goddamn same. I prefer a one star hotel I really do I'm more comfortable a one star motel the old school motor lodge you know the like root 66 shit to use shaped one story you just back it's gonna a pool in the middle of the driveway that's no longer a pool it's full of cement and some old police tape around it and you just back your van this close to the motel room door and you just hurl your shit inside you don't have to interact with people just leave me the fuck alone I look for my lodging based on the one star review because a one star review will tell you things that your secret is that you're not going to be able to see the one star review. You'll tell you things that you're secretly looking for that the proprietor could not openly promote. One star I didn't get a wink sleep in this place because it's attached to a dive bar that's open until four o'clock in the morning complete purchase now. This is no place for children no place is a place for children except maybe a cat carrier in a storage unit that would be fine. I think they were running prostitutes out of the room next door. One star the entire place reeked of stale cigarette smoke oddly that's my cologne I wear it daily and if it already stinks like that I don't have to worry about that bullshit $250 cleaning fee if you smoke in the room initial here don't worry lady I will be smoking in that room but it'll be fine because when I get home from that fucking ugly show I'm going to put a wet towel under the door I'm going to chain smoke cigarettes while I ignore missed calls from friends I don't keep in touch with anymore and fucking regret my life and in the morning I'm going to check out a bit early and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm going to do some stuff a giant rauded catfish into your microwave unit and I'm going to set that for about 45 minutes. I'm going to shuffle off to breakfast. And while that beast rod and slowly explodes and blistersோths it burns out into the walls of that microwave unit I'll be dinning comfortably at the excluderally you're never going to you're never gonna be able to smell cigarettes in that room again. Well, I'll be just fine. And before you ask, well, where do you get a giant dead-rotted catfish every night on the road? It's in my rider. I don't ask for a lot. I'll eat the green M&Ms. I just want some plastic jug vodka, some muddy bears, and a giant-rotted dead catfish, and-or-carp. Because I'm not picky. I'm not a brand-hawr. Except for the muddy bears. Gay-cousin-eric came on the road with us once. And, hey, Gay-cousin-eric, you get a fan out there somewhere. He was turning 21, and he thought it would be exciting to do a tour for a week on the road with us. Because he had something-I don't know what you even imagine the road is like, but it's not that. Like, if you have, like, high-no, but Gay-cousin-eric is 21, and he thought it's all gonna be like, you know, strippers and after parties, and bucket penthouse suites, and plates up below in the green room, and-eric, we don't even have a green room half the time. Where we're playing the middle of this pig country. A lot of times we're just sitting in the van at the fire exit in the back alley of some fucking gin-joint roadhouse place. Staring at our shoes. That's what we do on the road. We stare at our fucking shoes, yell at people, get back in the van. After about three days of dead silence, no one talks in the van, you wake up, you get in, stare at your shoes. Greg Chaley will put on a podcast of a comedian that you hate, so you can silently judge him as you sweat out alcoholic remorse. And Gay-cousin-eric is all happy. Oh, we're going to Chicago. Can we go to Riggley Field? Do you think that we could go to the Blues Hall of Fame? And they're going, no, we don't do things. And I remember that Chicago gig we were staying on the outer loop of Chicago in one of these Joloppy motels, and it's like 5'30 at night. Still no one's talking. We're eating some gas station pizza. No, they, we're not hungry. It's just that that hour you have to throw some kind of wet doughy substance down your neck. Just to slow up the flow of the alcohol that's about to be dumped your way at showtime as a prophylactic measure. It's the same way you would sandbag before a flood. It's not aesthetics, it's for safety. So, we're jam-a-peats in our head quietly, and Gay-cousin-eric was one of those moments where I just saw the exact moment where all his hopes and ambitions for this fun on this tour just dropped out of his face. Like his face fell. You know when, like you do hallucinogens with a buddy, and you can have an entire dialogue with just one glance, just one look on your face. You've spoken volumes, you just see. And you know every single thing that you're, but this was the opposite with Eric, because it was a negative where I just saw him look up at me. It's just that subtle, but I know what he meant. And it's not going to get better, Eric. Keep in mind, Eric, Gay-cousin-eric was not my cousin. At that time he was my brothers, my brothers then-wifes, now ex-wife, but her nephew, not even close to related. He's not even really gay. We called him Gay-cousin-eric to hide the fact that he was Jewish. That was the running joke. So I'm not really invested in how much of a good time Eric is or is not having, but at that moment he had pizza sauce on his face, and he just reached down and grabbed a hand towel off the carpet. And my reflexes were not quick enough to stop this from happening. So in slow motion I'm going, oh no! Whoa! No, Eric, no! Eric, you never use the face cloth that's underneath the laptop in a comedian's motel room. Oh, oh, oh, oh, you're gay now, Cousin-eric. Oh, you're so gay now. I bet there's a one-star review about that motel from Gay Cousin-eric now. The linens were really crusty. Exfoliating, but yeah! I would guess at this point, probably three-quarters of the email I get are surveys spam, basically. Like everything you buy, every fucking service you get, somehow they have my email address, and they want to know, hey, how about some feedback? You got your oil changed, you got some feedback, the cable guy came to your house, and how was your experience in fucking every Amazon purchase you make? Right? Take a few minutes and write a review. Why buy way too much shit from Amazon to take a few minutes every fucking purchase, like cocktail straws here. These. Plastic cocktail straws, because they're disappearing, so I'm stockpiling them. They're replacing them with fucking bamboo paper shit. No, I'm not putting, I'm not going to disrespect a cocktail with some fucking paper straw that's just going to flatten out. So I buy these, like a dollar 99 for a thousand from China, with no shipping charge. I don't know how that's humanly possible to send me a thousand, but then you get repeated fucking Amazon spam. Hey, tell us about your purchase. Share with our customers your review of fucking plastic cocktail straws. Really? How could I really make that interesting? I'm going to take it, and when you don't, they go, you must have forgot. I didn't forget. I said fuck you, no. I'm not a cocktail straw reviewer. How desperate is everybody for some review pad on the back star? It's like if you were getting your dick sucked. I'm getting my cock sucked in every stroke. They stop. Oh, is that okay? Is that right? If there's anything you want me to do different, tell me I'm open to suggestions. Would you recommend it to a friend? On a scale from one to five, five being the best, very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, dissatisfying. But I'm just laying back there going, sir, if I didn't like it, I would have shown you to the door, just fucking man up and finished the job. If I have some beef with a big corporation, I'm not going to waste that grievance in an email. I am going to call the 800 number old school because I want the human connection where I can hear the tears on the other end of the phone when I bellow at them because I wake up hating myself and want to blame the rest of the world. And I use that as an outlet and I don't target Indian call centers. It's just there, the ones invariably who answer the phone anymore when you're angry at a corporation and you want to give them shit, they transfer all the shit calls to some poor fucking India. And I don't want to rain on their already dreary parade. But even when I try not to, they fucking up just in the greeting. When she says, thank you for calling direct TV, my name is Madison. How may I help you? No, it's not. Your name's not Madison. Nobody in Mumbai, India is named Madison. I haven't even opened my mouth and you've already lied to me on the phone. Tell me a real fucking name. I am a long term God damn customer. I have 19 direct TV boxes so I can get every game at my house because I have to buy my friends and I deserve more respect. That for you to open a phone call, lying to my fucking face, tell me your real goddamn name. Just on the, I don't even remember the reason I called to begin with. Now it's just give me your fucking real name on principle. And I just, and when the anger tactic doesn't get the results I'm looking for, then I come in soft, good cop bad cop. Hey, Maddie. Listen, I know the game. I understand the racket. You live in a poor country. It's hard to feed your family. Yeah, you had to take this shit job at a call center to make ends meet. Your own name is unpronounceable in the English language. They made you pick a stripper name out of a training manual. I get it. You picked Madison. There's nothing wrong with that. But Maddie, I'm not a customer right now. Right now, I'm your friend. We're two human beings sharing one honest moment on a telephone line. So be my friend and be honest with me. What's your real name? My, my name is Madison. You're a fucking lying pig. How fucking dare you? I know where you live. I'm a goddamn American. I'll have your village bombed sending the drones. The call invariably ends with I hope you get gang raped. No, because I want her to know that I have some insight into her culture. Because that's how they do in the India. That's a thing. It's what they have to deal with gang, Indian men gang rape. It's sad and it's savage and because Indian men are not strong enough to rape by themselves. It's physiology or sociology. It's fucking science. You get your G day and come debate me, but it's it's true. Indian men don't have the upper body strength to pin and submit. Do you ever see a Indian dude in the UFC? No, you never will. Unless he's a ring girl. That's why they created their God, Vishnu with so many arms, to represent what it would take for even their God to be able to take a lady down alone. Don't take this the wrong way. I'm saying Indian men are basically the women of men in that they like if there were no women, Indian men would be the ones that you'd want to make the love that. Hopefully on a good day, sometimes you're going to get drunk and slum it with a hipster, but you're going to be imagining him as an Indian man underneath you because Indian men are the most beautiful polite, accommodating, tossiles, supple of men. They have that sick silky, thick black hair just dense everywhere. Their whole head, their whole one eye brow, their back, souls of their feet. Legend has it. Hair is stick as their head like a slipper on the bottom of their feet, skating on sunshine. Indian men are the most attractive of men, not to women, hence the rape problem with their gang raping. I'm a dreamer, I'm an idealist. I like to believe in a world where everyone lives on a level playing field where everybody's equal, where an Indian man could at least believe in himself enough and have the courage to at least try to rape solo. He couldn't do it. Panic. Indian guy tried to rape you all by himself in a dark parking lot. You would just laugh like you're laughing now and pull your hand on his forehead like when you're four year old nephew tries to swing punches at you and you just hold him out of arms reach till he tuckers himself out and gets all tired and then you laugh and you go back to Easter dinner and everyone has a fine time. But at least that guy had enough self esteem to make the attempt a community lifted him up enough to have the self confidence to try because nobody ever wants to die thinking what if. At least he put it out there and I'll be honest I don't know if this bit has a point. But if there is a point it's this is it wrong to use racism to try to stop gang rape. And that's a question for you to answer individually. Don't shoot the messenger I put that on you and you have to make the decision which is right and which is wrong and either answer you come up with you're a fucking asshole. You're either a vulgar racist or you're a gang rape apologist either way you're sick in me. I can't believe I perform for you people. Hey this got full. I'm the night of Saturday, May 25th I made wildly inappropriate stereotypes regarding Indian men that I thought were said in confidence. I hadn't noticed the cameras, the microphone and the giant shrieking audience. Yet still this does not excuse me promoting such a meopic denigration of a country wonderfully rich in heritage and humanity. I hope this apology will usher in a new era of understanding and open a dialogue that allows all of us to grow. And rape jokes are never funny. That's the thing. If you're a new comic in here and you deal with all that bullshit just write it out. It's always going to be something. I've been doing this since 1990 and there's always a topic that everyone decides now you can't. When I started in Vegas 1990 at the dive bar. Thank you. Back to 1990 when I started open mics it was AIDS jokes. Oh my god. If you ever mentioned AIDS on stage no there's no funny thing. It's just awful and how dare you. You're contemptible. And then a decade later 9-11 jokes you cannot mention 9-11 unless you're doing some bogus. Let's take a moment and pause for the first responders because it's a difficult time or going through. Yeah it was that then look at those two subjects now. Fucking hilarious. Write it out. If you bundled all three of those topics and you had the premise of like rogue AIDS on airplanes flying into the twin towers without their consent. Just the premise gets a laugh without even a punch line. Let it go. It's always going to be something and someone's going to always be fucking upset. I feel honestly I feel like I lost a lot of street cred with my people for not being outed in the whole Me Too movement. I think a lot of people were expecting that and let down when it never happened. It's not like I don't have my stories. I'm yeah I've Me Too did up. Yeah I was Me First. I tried to start that hashtag when I was doing it about Me first for the record. I was never in the the rape happy deep end of that ugly part of the Me Too swimming pool with Harvey Weinstein but in the shallow end in the kitty pool part. Pull your dick out in front of people. How many people haven't seen my dick at this point? Half my career. That would be a go-to thing if I couldn't remember my next bit on stage. I just pulled my dick out. I take a Polaroid picture with the Yeager, my sister girls and five dollars. Yeah I'm pulling my dick out. I pulled my dick out in front of Louis CK. There's a picture of it in my book. I printed the predators. And unlike Louis CK I didn't ask permission politely first. I just pulled my dick out for a picture. I can't get Me Too. I had a friend of mine, a comedian named Alicia Wood that tried to Me Too Me last year on Twitter with a story that only made me think, oh fuck that story should be in my act. I forgot all about it. She just reminded me of a hilarious story that I banked away somewhere and some dead grey sign apps. And I called her up and I go, what the fuck are you doing? That story needs to be written long form. I said, there's so much meat to that story now that I'm remembering it. You can't put that in a tweet. So I'm helping you write and edit my own Me Too Me story. I was fucking funny and she's wasting it. The story is, early 2000s probably, we're playing a comedy club. Looney's in Colorado Springs and after this show some guys wanted a picture with me and back then again, pulled my dick out. It was a regular thing for me. Back then, that was CD Days where you'd have a CD you sold after a show for five bucks for gas money. And people would say, hey, will you sign it? And I go, oh, I don't have a catch phrase like get her down or na-nu-na-nu or something. So I just occasionally pulled my dick out and traced my shrunken dick on the insert and then signed over it because I had plenty of room for both. And I was, it was a different day in age. It's not like the current climate, which I hate that. The current climate, you know what? When you never leave your house, the current climate is wherever you set the thermostat. When you left last. So these guys, they want a picture and I go, okay, let's all drop trow for the picture. Ha, standing in a lobby of a comedy club with their dick out. It was funny. The guy next to me, we called him Fester afterwards because he looked like Uncle Fester. He's a kid, a little bald-headed, fire plug of a dude. He pulled his pants down and he had micro-penis, which is what it's called, the medical condition. Like real micro-penis, not, oh, looks like it's cold out. Oh, wow, wow. No, he had like a half a thumbnail, like a car bunkal. He had just no dick. But he pulled his pants down with such heroics and a plomb and careless, reckless abandon. That's what it is, reckless abandon, pause for it. Because that's what I wanted to say all weekend. He pulled his pants down with such reckless abandon to show off the smallest penis in the world that we immediately fell in love with this guy. Like you are the fucking gutsyest beautiful, fucking strong human being. We befriended him and we took him out with us and we brought him to all the bars and got him hammered. And then he ends up back at the comedy condo, which is a apartment where they put up three comics, three bedrooms. And we got more drunk there. And at some point it was my idea to do blindfold hand job. And I said, Fester, this is what? What we're going to do is we're going to blindfold you as me. I'm like buddy Ben and a waitress that was a drunkard and a player and a fucking regular solid folk. And I said, we're going to blindfold you. And you have to guess which one of the three of us is giving you a hand job. And I know she's going to do it. We made the eye contact. She's in. But even if she bailed out, I would have done it. Because his penis was so small as to be non-threatening to a level where you would touch it anyway as a curiosity. So I blindfold Fester with my bathrobe tie and she unzips his pants and Ben and I hide around the corner a little bit because we don't want to laugh and give away who's giving him a hand job. But she gives it away right away because she starts giving him the best dirty talk you porn hand job. She's like, oh, I can't wait to see this cock come for me. It's fucking beautiful. Oh God. This is so hot. I want to see your cum drip all over my and Ben and I are both leaning in with half boners wishing we had micro penis. Because this is the best hand job ever. And the only thing I noticed that was missing was she needed a lube. So I tipped her across the carpet of the living room, get to the kitchen and I grabbed some palm olive dish soap which not a sponsor yet. But when this story comes out, I'm sure we'll be flooded with money. I, I reenpaul all of all over this little dick hand job and then I get a little carried away. And I thought what other condiments can I put into this? He's blindfolded so I opened the refrigerator and I can have mustard this to cruel. I found crumbled goat cheese. And I sprinkle a good amount of that into the hand. And then I went back over with Ben still trying not to laugh and ruin his experience. And the part that I hadn't remembered was Alicia Wood. She was there. She was the opening act. Sleeping like a baby in the third bedroom. So evidently I went and I woke her up. She got to get off. You're missing it. Just get out of here. Just kept out the whole watch. This micro penis goat cheese dish so bad. Why this micro penis dish soap goat cheese just come here and look. Look. I'm fucking mad. The fuck is that. It's my tiny ticket. Just fuck off. And she went back to bed and then fucking 18 years later. Trying to meet to that story in a tweet and said it made her feel uncomfortable. What? It's a fucking hilarious thing. Look, if I was a new comic on the road and I could take it out, I'm actually doing this as a professional now. And I get to be in a comedy condo. And all the other comics are witnessing goat cheese micro penis dish soap hand job. And you didn't wake me up for that. I would take that as a strong signal that I'm not welcome. And the group. Why would you fucking leave me out like some Rudolph the Red Nose reindeer wake me up. You're uncomfortable. Imagine that kids mom having to do as laundry the next day. She's uncomfortable. What are you? You're uncomfortable. What are you fucking lactose intolerant and now goat cheese is a trigger. You don't like sudsy hand jobs with your choice of toppings. What the fuck. Fester had a better me to story in that that she did she just looked around a corner that kid was coerced by a powerful man that he respected and looked up to and was coerced in a receiving a hand job he may or may not have wanted. I think there's a lot of crossover in the me to movement where a lot of the people that you are trying to out and shame and say fuck off. There's a good cross section are the same people that I am afraid of. The fucking douchebag Saturday night last call fucking asshole Jaco bro dudes when they can't fuck you they want to fight me that your hey lady nice tits I get what are you looking at. I'm not a faggot it's the same guys. It's a big cross section of that yet I'm still expected to fight that guy because you're faggot why don't you just punch him in the face. Hey said you had nice tits why didn't you just suck his dick. Hey that's what he wants I don't want to fight him and you don't want to suck his dick but it's the same douchebag but I don't get to ride your hashtag. Fucking weak dude gets nothing we'll learn to fight. It says learn to suck dick. I can't fight. Would you call me stupid rape is not a crime of sex it's a crime of violence you know what so is violence a crime of violence. Where's my fucking hashtag protection. I walk into a bar get my head stoved in because I walk into a raiders bar wearing a Bronco's jersey and everyone says I was asking for it by the way I was asking for it. By the way I was dressed. I'm saying equal protection. I don't even go out I only go out after shows when it's with you where I go I got I got people here I don't go out people people scare the fuck out of me they're awful we were in we're in Indianapolis we're going through a car wash because that's one of the fun things you can do as a tourist in Indiana. I go through a car wash when it's not even your car it was a fucking rental car you're washing other people shit because it's the worst state of the 50 and we get into the car wash it's just me and Greg Chaley my tour manager and it's a huge line and we get stuck in but I needed a haircut so I spot a barbershop across the strip mall parking lot I bet Greg Chaley 20 bucks that I could get my hair cut. Before he can get through this interminable line in a car wash because that's another fun thing you can do as a tourist in Indiana it's just bet $20 on any stupid thing and hopefully the wager makes it exciting. How many plates do you think that fat fucks going to eat at the Golden Corral I'll give you over under five and a half not counting the chocolate waterfall because I'm not counting the chocolate water fall. Because it probably just stick his tongue in there and not even use a plate on his way out. So I race as fast as old fat smoker can race across the parking lot to the barbershop fuck you Chaley I'll beat you this time and I give it to the barbershop door and I whip it open and oh it's really crowded. And it's a barbershop like those movies. It's a very urban audience. It's ethnic crowd. The defensive line in football. You're Atlanta based flight crew. The New Zealand rugby team. However you say the all blacks. I was a fucking sea of black dudes scaring right back at me and I held this position for far too long. I was frozen. I don't know what my play is at this point. They don't seem to want me here. I still don't know what I should have done at that point but I know what I did. I kind of ran. Think a little bit. I acted like I opened the wrong business door in the strip mall. I'm looking for something else. Oh I'm sorry. I was looking for the bridal shop next door. I'm getting married in the morning. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My bad. Because my first thought was there's no way I'm going to win the bet with Chaley now. Because those places mobbed every stool is full. There's 11 other guys on the back wall waiting in line. I can't win. My second thought which is my first thought and every other thought I had. I'm terrified by a room full of black dudes staring hard at me. Because I've been a human being for over a half a century. And one thing I've noticed about the human condition is most people are ugly, angry, fucking scary animals. And if you're confronted with a group of any type of the same types of human being and you're the one guy different, maybe a good time to kind of run. If I opened that door and it was a room full of hells angels or snake handling evangelicals, and it was stopped and gone, oh wait, they're all white, they'll love me. No, you get the fuck out of there. If it was a room full of Indian men, cup your ass all and run anywhere but to public transit because that's where they get you according to the news reports. So I get about halfway across the parking lot and this old barber comes out and he looks like Morgan Freeman and he's smiling with every tooth in his mouth. I could see from a distance because he's so happy. He saw right through my bullshit. He does exactly what was going through my bind. And he was, hey man, where you going? Oh, they're going to fuck with me. I see where this is going and I wander back over and I mumble some excuse about my friends in the car wash and I know there's a lot of people in line and I can't, I don't have time to wait and he goes, oh no, there is no wait. I'll take you right now. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. And he walks me back in like I'm a child that just could caught running away from summer camp. And I get in and there was no wait because all those guys on the back wall they're just hanging out in a fucking barber shop. They're not there to get their hair cut. This is fucking watching TV and shit. That's what they do. I thought that was an urban myth all pun intended. But no, they actually just fucking hang out like it's a bar. And I walk in and at this point I am visibly trembling because I'm sober. It's early in the day. I want to explain that to everybody in there. Oh, this has nothing to do with the color of your skin. I'm a long-term alcoholic. This is what 230 in the afternoon looks like every day of my life. You don't get credit for the boo's shakes. That's mine. Don't explain anything. Just shut up and sit down and get your hair cut. People light. And he sits me in the barber's stool and spins me to the mirror. And around the mirror just like your mom's beauty parlor. And I have photographs of all the different hair styles that are available to me today. I can't find any that are appropriate for my hair. They're going to carve a dollar bill symbol into the side of my skull. And I'm just going to sit here and take it. They're going to put an LA clippers logo on the back of my baldened paint. And I'm just going to smile and say thanks. Shut up. Get your hair cut. People light. Overtip. Which in that environment means tip whatsoever. And get the fuck out. And it was the best haircut experience I've ever had in my life. So fucking old dude like me. A lot of times I've noticed. I was suited up thankfully. And when you're wearing a fucking over-the-top grotesquely loud suit and you have your shit together, a black guy will fucking notice that. And fucking, yes, we're in your socks match your tie brother. Man, that's fucking sharp. And he did it his old guy so he did all my old crazy eyebrows and my ear hairs and he hot-toweled me. I begged off when I was offered the straight razor shave only because he's old dude like me. And I don't know how much he drinks every night. I don't know how stable his hands are. So I walked at that point. But would I go back? Fuck no. Not unless they move out of Indiana. It's the worst fucking state in the world. I should never have to play there again. I have fucking ear hair than I have to play Indiana again. It's their turn to fucking move. I like to stop right now and point out, I am not racist. And I only say that not because I give a shit if you're offended. I say that because I worry that a lot of you might be racist. And I need you to know I'm not your friend. If you can't read context into these bits or tone or intent, stop my fault. They say that. You know what? Jokes have circumstances, words hurt. You might think that they're just jokes. But it's how other people interpret them. And if they interpret them wrong, well, if they interpret them wrong, then fucking yell at them. You can give me shit. Don't, just because you guys don't get it and you fuck up my comedy. yell at them. Them too. Hashtag them too. Stupid idiots and don't get it. I am not racist. But that doesn't mean there's other people I don't hate for just as stupid a reason. It's just racism and one of them. I have my own isms. Sometimes there's types of people that just fuck you off. And it's just as dumb as any other. But you can't help it. It's an internal hate. You just shut the fuck up and be polite. I am an agist. That is my big ism. I am disgusted by graphically elderly people. They gross me out so much. I can't be around them. I don't know why you bring them out in public. I'm talking like gross elderly. Like not cute. Keith Richards is still alive or Betty White or something. Functional elderly. I'm talking about the gross things that you bring out of a home. Like Kirk Douglas kind of gross. And you bring them in public. I'm just trying to eat brunch at a perkins on a Sunday morning. The hangover. And then I see the van pull up. And you're bringing out. You're fucking old thing. Can folk under each chicken wing? One more stepber thin. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. Your other foot. Good girl. The tongue is darting in and out of their mouth. It's called tartive dyskinesia. When they can no longer control their mouth and the tongue just. It darts in and out like whack a mole. It's all coated like they've been licking cheese or chalk. A rec room somewhere where their family abandoned them. Are you're almost to the door, Bethy? You're doing so good. Where are we going? You know, they're going to sit that fucking thing next to me. I guarantee it. The skin is all dried and blanched like rice paper with big purple splotches underneath it. You know, if you accidentally drug an angry hang now across that, it would bleed sausage. It would spore on it. Yeah. Here we go. We're almost to the table. Yeah. It's fucking right next to me. Their eyes don't work anymore, but the pockets underneath the big pink pockets are full of fluid to like an infinity pool. They're full to the top. You know, if you stuck one finger in the lower lid, all that liquid would just pour down their face like ocular buccacchi. Yeah. It's sitting next to me. They got scabs that were never a cut. They used to be a sunspot and now it's some thick pepperoni dried and curling up off their scalp. I'm trying to eat undercooked eggs benadec, right next to this. God, off our fucks sake. I'll take it to go. Yeah, it's a horrible fucking way to feel about people, but it's honest. You don't say it. I think ageism is the worst ism to have when you're aware of it. Being an ageist on that level is like, if you were a racist, who's very aware that you're rapidly turning black yourself. Somehow you still can't quell the hate. Ridiculing old fucks who are unable to defend themselves is punching down. And certainly something I would never do. I was taken out of context. I was on ambient. Russians hacked my teleprompter. That's just not funny. It's out of context with all of my standards and morals. There's some issues that you just never make fun. You shouldn't make fun. I look. Just the idea that the expression making fun could ever be a negative. You shouldn't make fun. I'm sorry. Did I take some subjects that are ugly and dark and so lacerating, painful, shitty, maybe unavoidable in life kind of stuff? And I made it fun. What a dick I must be. I can't believe just for attempting that, herculean feet of making awful shit fun. This is what you have to do in life. It's try to make fun. If you know how life works, it starts out where you're born into being fed a hard diet of lies and fantasies. And then that just turns into a series of disappointments as you start to figure out everything you know is wrong. And then you get to live in the failures one after another and tragedies that are just waiting in the bushes to jump out and bite you in the fucking thigh. And then at best it ends with you on a cold slab in a medical university with hungover teenagers throwing around your internal organs waving your fucking dead wang at each other and laughing. And that's the best it can happen. And so in the meantime, you better try to make that shit fun. We had a friend and a fan that died. Laura Kimball was her name. And she was the best version of the word fan. And I'm dedicating this special to her because if there's one thing that she loved more than comedy, it was empty gestures. So I'm going to dedicate this to her. She had a perfect life. She was 42. Husband making bank and silicone vallage. She's beautiful with two beautiful little toe headed Barton Lisa Simpson kind of kids. Gated community all the shit so she could come out to all of our shows. Anytime we're up and down the west coast, she sat in the lower Kimball chair that side of front row. And she called me up. She said, I just could diagnose to a stage for melanoma. It spread to my brain. And they're giving me six months to live on the outside. And I don't know what to do. And I said, well, I'm playing San Jose in a month. So try to hang out that long. And then we'll come goof around. Well, I'm not a fucking doctor. I'm not going to give her one other advice. I'm not going to give her a new fucking Eastern treatment. No, I'll be there. Don't die till I get to San Jose. And she showed up in the chair. She looked really good. I had written a whole pocket full of, ha ha, you're going to die of brain cancer type of jokes just to fuck with her and roast her a little bit. Because that's what she'd want. That's what she would expect. And we had a great night. And two months later, I'm playing Santa Cruz just down the street basically. And there she is again with no warning. And she looked a little worse for the wear, but still pretty good. But now I'm out of, ha ha, you're going to die of brain cancer jokes. I had no preparation. So I'm trying to riff off the top of my head. Ha ha, Laura, ha ha, the brain cancer. Until I go back into my same old boring act that she's heard over and over. This continues for months. She lived 13 months and every few months she just show up in my show here in the same fucking act. At one point I leaned into her and I go, Laura, would you please fucking die? You're ruining my comedy. It's so hard to fucking say the same material. Where you're sitting there and you know you've heard it. And that night I said to her, I said, how am I going to know when you're dead? Because we don't have any mutual friends. I just know you from all these shows from the years. And you can't tweet me from hell, which is where you're going. And she said, I gave my husband Paul your number, take down his number. He's going to call you when the inevitable happens. So I put Paul Kimball into my phone under warning warning. Major bus kill. Do not answer. Bad news only. No, what the fuck I'm going to say to this guy? So when I got the call from her husband, I decided I'm just going to talk to him the same way. You talk to anyone of your drinking buddies who just got dumped by some short term Tinder skanker's often. And I just talked to him, I go, hey, what's up? How's it going? Oh, oh, she's dead. Yeah, fuck her anyway, dude. Fuck her. You don't need that shit. You can do way better than her. What are you kidding? Fuckin' be a bitch about this. Let's get back out there. Come on. Nobody even liked her. Cry about this. Let's go to Vegas and hit some titty bars and bang some 12-ounce curls. We're going to change your Facebook status to player. Be a fucking whining bitch about this. And he laughed, which was a pretty big gamble. It was a pretty big roll of the dice to take that tact. But that's what you have to do. When life gets its ugliest, it's your responsibility to dig into the muck and try to make fun. And if they don't laugh, you just cut them out of your social circle. It's that simple. Get rid of them. Life is too short to hang around with people who don't get the goof. Fuck them. Thank you very much. I appreciate you coming out. I'll be out there in the casino at some point. Before you talk to me or ask me for a picture if I'm gambling, see the look on my face to see if I'm losing or not. Good night. You You You
I wanted to know what sex felt like so I took your manicure tool and I put it. I don't know. The first time that I tried masturbating I ended up in the emergency room. And it happened because I went through this super awkward puberty leading up to it. When I was 15 that was the year that all of my friends lost their virginity and I was the only one who hadn't yet. I felt really left out like my friends would talk about their favorite positions at lunch and I would just bury myself in my sandwich like oh cool, anal. I was so naive. I had a very leased a Simpson vibe in school. Like a guy passed me a note in math class that just said 69 on it and I didn't know what that meant yet. I thought he was starting a math game with me. So I just built on to it. I was like 69 divided by 3 is 23 your turn. He was like the fuck no this is not what you think this is. And I got teased for not knowing and I just like I kind of snapped right like there's too many things building up. I was so sick of feeling left out and clueless and I was sick of waiting for a boyfriend to lose my virginity too. So I got this crazy idea and I was like okay I'm gonna stick something up there so I don't know what sex feels like and I can feel cooler around my friends. I know how mentally unstable this sounds by the way. Anytime you go to home made dildo route never a great idea. But I was so desperate to fit in that I just decided to take matters into my own pussy. So I was like this is happening now. So I went home from school and I decided to look around the house for an object to lose my virginity too. And just like anyone's first time I was super nervous. And I went to my mom's bathroom closet because it was just full of like phallic wonders right. Like sonic hair toothbrush handles and travel size shampoo bottles. But the thing that really caught my eye was she had this handheld manicure tool. You could put little attachments on top to like buff your nails but the handle was shaped like a dick. A little too much like a dick by the way like whoever designed it was definitely targeting curious teenage girls. And lonely housewives. It was bright blue it looked like pop a smurfs boner just so awkward. The only problem I didn't notice at the time was that it was made of a grippy rubber material. There's a little foreshadowing for you. But again I knew nothing about that hole in like what should or shouldn't go in there. So I draw my pants and I put my foot up on the side of the tub as you do. Hi sir, by the way this is weird for both of us. And I started to try and you know like make this happen but I'm not aroused by anything that's going on. Frankly I'm terrified. So I'm as dry as a dead man's mouth. My body is not helping me at all. So that combined with this grippy rubber material it's like a kid trying to go down an unsoaked slip and slide. It's just like nothing. So I stop for a sec and the same part of my brain is like dude this is clearly not meant to be. You just need a way to have regular person sex. And then the crazy part of my brain was like I'm not a fucking quitter. Marty crouched over naked like golem. Like we've come this far. Let's just throw the hail Mary. So all of my desperation to fit in fueled my tiny pubescent wrist until I fit the manicure tool all the way inside of me. And then I just stood there frozen for a second within and be like ugh. And then I threw it out and I threw it in the trash and I got in the shower and like washed a shame off. And I knew that something was horribly wrong right away because I started to feel a burning and itching sensation. And I was like oh fuck. Okay I'll look at it with a mirror and maybe it will look fine. What I saw in that mirror still haunts my dreams to this day. Crouch had swollen shut. Close like the bank on a Sunday. My pussy looks like Rocky's eye turned sideways. Yeah no bueno. So my stomach dropped. I was like oh my god. I need medical attention. I'm going to have to tell a doctor exactly what I just did. But before that I'm going to have to tell my mom because I need somebody to drive me to the doctor's office. Like my puberty is just flashing before my eyes. Everything's coming to an end. So my mom is in bed at this point. She's doing like a crossword puzzle or something. I walk in pale as a ghost. And she's like what's going on with you? What's wrong? And I was like I don't know how to tell you this because you're never going to see me the same way again. She was like sweetie nothing you tell me can make me stop loving you. I was like let's not say things we can't take back. I was like I wanted to know what sex felt like. So I took your manicure tool and I put it in. I put it inside me and now my vagina is gone. And my mom was like wow. Well we were going to have corn dogs for dinner but now that seems like a safety hazard. She's like alright get in the car. Here we go. Going to the doctor's office. So we drove down to the emergency clinic. I grew up in this tiny town. I've been seeing the same family doctor since I was like five years old. He's this 60 year old Christian man. Very Steve from Blue's Clues type of energy. Not great for this situation. He has no idea how to handle it. He's like okay Kelsey we're all a little confused as to what she did. Something with a manicure tool. Susan do you know? No nobody knows. Okay. Do I need to have a little look see at your undercarriage? Just put me down like an old animal. Oh my god. I can't do this. So he straps on his minor's headlight. To go spillunkin for treasure. And he goes down and he pokes around with a q-tip a little bit and he comes back and he's like alright. So you know from all the swelling and burning and inflammation I can deduce that you are allergic to latex. So you know going forward that means no latex condoms, no latex gloves. Please don't do anything with balloon animals. So I love the clinic that day with that knowledge. And I'm allergic to latex. All my future boyfriend's have been very happy about that. Alright you know just high fives all around no condoms. I'm just riddled with disease. Unfortunately I didn't redeem my awkward reputation at school. You know I did all that to try and fit in and instead word spread around the school of what happened and everybody was like, hey old hairy bush made her pussy disappear. Check that out. The world's worst magician over here. How so embarrassed like this haunted me for 10 years. I was just mortified about it. And I honestly thought I was done with my latex encounters until two years ago when I moved to Los Angeles and I went to a new doctor for my annual exam. I was lying back on the table. He did the whole like fingers inside your business. And then I sat up as he was taking his gloves off. And I was like, oh no. I was like, are those latex gloves? And he was like, yeah. Do you have an allergy? And I was like, yeah. And he's like, oh I'm so sorry. What happens when you come into contact with it? And I was like, my vagina tries to kill itself. And he was like, oh shoot, okay. Well, there's not much I can do for you right now. I can prescribe you some cream that you can spread down there. It's like it's not a bagel. I don't want to do that. So he writes me this prescription and he walks out and I'm just standing there so pissed. I'm like, there's no way I'm going through this again. Like there has to be a way around this. So my survival instincts kicked in and I locked the doctor's office door behind me. And I got another crazy idea. I was like, okay. I'm in a masturbate because if I can make myself come, I might be able to flush out the allergens before a reaction starts. I think Bill and I would be pretty proud of my plan. There's obviously no scientific research behind this at all. But I just like, I just have to try this. I have to go for it. I'm also standing there like, I can't believe that 10 years ago I tried masturbating and I gave myself an allergic reaction. And now I'm going to masturbate to try to not have an allergic reaction. Really a decade of doing the Lord's work this one. So I'm racing against the clock at this point. Like this reaction is coming. So I draw my pants and I just like close my eyes. I try to like find a way to be turned on. I just a picture that chanitatoms behind me just like, you know, grinding it out, some pony by genuine, you know, just like really encouraging me. And by the power of magic mic, I came. And I did not have an allergic reaction. Thank you. Yeah. Sometimes you got to be your own douche. And now I think I should get the letters Rx tattooed on these two fingers. So the only prescription I need, motherfucker. Alright, I'm Kelsey Cook. Thanks so much.

From the dollar podcast, give it up for the incredible guest, Kletto! Thank you for coming to the news! He's got a lot of other wonderful folks! He's got a lot of wonderful people! He's got an awesome, good to know all these wonderful people! He's got a lot of wonderful people! He's got a lot of wonderful people! All right! Oh, you devil! Thank you! I've not done anything yet! So let's temper that! Come on, let's be real! All right, we'll just jump into it, right? That's what we... I'm a child of immigrants! Anyone here to child of immigrants? Yeah, get her! All right, no, I'm just kidding! I was raised by English people in America, even though my parents spoke the same language, I always had a translate for my mother. My mother never really adopted American English. You know, she'd be like, Cheerio! I'd be like, she's saying goodbye! She'd be like, oh, I fancy a cup of tea! I'd be like, she's looking for tea! She'd be like, tell them to! I was like, she's saying thank you! She'd be like, I'm quite knackered! I'd be like, she's tired! She'd be like, I'm chuffed! I'd be like, she's happy! She'd be like, oh, I'm pissed! I'd be like, she's drunk! She'd be like, pop, pop, on your back! Pubs your fanny! I'd be like, she's saying, I actually... I don't know! Lay her down! Some's wrong! Get her feet up! Elevator feet! She's phomic! But it's sticking her mouth out, damn it! It was always weird to me, though, to watch my parents. My parents were told like this, and we talked like this, and I was like, that's weird! How did that happen? Because when you think about it, it was a bunch of British people that came to this country, right? To what I understand was an occupied land, and they came... I'm not sure how that's still a little controversial to us, but here it is, I guess. I don't know. The truth is, if you really think about it, there are people who came to this country ever discovered were trusting people. But anyway, gobble gobble happy Thanksgiving! Let me move on. But we talked like this, they came here like, and we talked like this, how did that happen? Well, I'm glad you asked. I was looking it up, and there is a theory that it was just a decision that they made, that they just decided to do it! Which is an amazing moment in history! One day two old dusty white dudes are hanging out, one of them is just like, Winthrop, Matt Benjolri for a moment, is like, why, yes Philips, what is it? Is that what I just had to thought, and how we could further separate ourselves from the British if we desired to do so? Of course we desired to do so, we made the big move! Is that what I was thinking? What if we were to just talk entirely differently? Talk entirely differently? Whatever do you mean? He was instead of talking like this, this is what we were all to do, he was just thinking, you know, what if we were to just, no, you know, talk like this! Hello! He goes, what have you done there? You've got the devil's tongue! Shing, and he's like, no, that's still me! It's still me! He's like, oh, yes, Shing! I like that! We're Americans! We talk differently! When did you have time to come up with something this brilliant? He's like, well, I just made time in my schedule! Ah, yes, you mean schedule! No, I mean schedule! No, you mean, wow, okay, wow! I see what you've done there! Now, don't hate it! Got anything else? It's all right, well, I have one more, but it is a bit drastic, and he goes, come on, mate, you're on a roll! Out with it! Is that what we really wanted to show? That we are completely independent, completely different! What if we were to just fix our teeth? He's like, no, you've lost me! You've lost me! You pushed it there, you've lost me! You were doing so, what were you shopping our tools with? You've not thought this through! You really? And then they just went through the rest of the country, you know, they went down south, they're like, I'm tired of talking like this, I was thinking, maybe we could go a little more in-lot this through it. What do you all think? Maybe a little more like this? Something like that? Got to the Midwest, so I'm tired of talking like this. I was thinking, maybe we could change it up a little bit? Like, go in this direction, kind of hit that all. Nice hit that all, you know? Got to California, like, tired of doing it! Let's just go on, let's, what if we were just a little more like, whoa, what the fuck? Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's egregious, you know? Not historically accurate, but it's fun. We like fun, right? That's fun. I don't know, you know. You know, they do think, in times of Shakespeare, that they didn't even sound English. They think they sound a more Bostonian. Yeah, which ruins Shakespeare right away, doesn't it? All those beautiful plays and sonnets coming out through that filter? No, thank you. Just back then people were like, come on, we're gonna go watch some Shakespeare in the pack! It's like, ugh, I don't feel sick. Oh, my God. I feel like I got punched. Going to see it is just like, a last-poor y'all wreck. I knew this dude's so good! Come on, kid, he's dead! Hey, see, it's skull! It's fucked! It's like, Romeo, Romeo, where for art thou Romeo? Seriously, where is this twat? This balcony's freezing. My nipples are so hot! English people are sensitive about teeth jokes. They don't like them. I've learned that one. My mother lives in England. I was there recently. We were just watching game shows hanging out. And I'm one of the game shows. The question came on, on average, how many teeth is a British person missing? That was on a game show. Yeah. I was like, to all your game shows culturally indict you like that? Then it's like, say what you will about this country. We got problems, but our game shows are an escape, right? You never watch it at game shows. It's like, on average, how many oxy-cotton does a West Virginia? You know what I mean? It's like... It's a distraction. It's a distraction. It's a distraction. The options. Two, four, and seven. For how many teeth is a British person missing? Miss, you can play the ad home version. Two, four, seven. How many teeth on average is a British person missing? You think four? She said seven. You're going with the most defensive one. Well, my dear. You'll be interested. No, it was actually seven. She's right. It was seven. It's seven. It's obviously seven. She's right. Come on. I wouldn't be doing the joke if it wasn't seven. Seven. Seven. Seventy. From their heads. They're not sharks. That's a lot of teeth. Everybody, okay? That is a quarter of your teeth legally. Seventy. I was like, I could not believe it. I was like, 17th. My uncle was over. He's like, oh, stop that, Betty. If you think of that, yeah? I was like, that's a lot of teeth, dude. He goes, no, they're pooping all the time. I don't have much to do. I'm not going to lie to you. Not about much that does. Make a wish. And that's what I realized. England isn't a country. It's just a pilot teeth that people figured out how to grow potatoes. Together? How'd you meet? Uh, they're at school. Why is that funny? She's like, school is crazy. Why is that funny? How are we met in England? Ah, interesting. Right. English people love the mass culture more than anyone. I'll tell you that. They're like, finally. Nobody knows. I'll see Chris. LAUGHTER Probably won't release that one. That will get me like, I can't go see my mother. I'll just be able to see my mother's like, they're gone. No, they're not gone. They're not gone. How did you meet in England? You were at school in England? Yeah, I just studied abroad. You studied abroad. I was at the end. And then where? Sheffield. And then how did you meet in school? What's the first date in England? Go to the pub? Absolutely. Yeah, that's all you can do. What a shaggot man who goes to the pub. We've got two options. Let's do a shaggot use. Right, that sounds good. Married? Do you ever go back to Sheffield? No, of course not. Why would you? You're not English, are you? You are English. Oh, this is super awkward all of a sudden, isn't it? I just picked up on your accent. Yeah, man, no. You fucking prick. And I love your answer that you don't go back. You're English. No, don't go back. Good for you. Muzzle, muzzle. I definitely found it strange being raised by English people in America. Immigrant parents raise you with sort of weird traditions. But the more I travel to country, talk to people, the more I realize it wasn't that my parents were immigrants. It's just parents. Parents just give you a bunch of fill your head with weird shit. And then you become a grown-up. And then you're out there like, yeah, we used to do this. And people are like, what? And you're like, yeah, my house has like a tradition. And they're like, that's not. It's not a bus. It's tradition. It's a tradition. This one guy I was talking to him. And he was like, his family didn't celebrate any holidays. Except for one that they celebrated twice a year. And you, like me, are probably like, what holidays twice a year? Well, you're not going to figure it out. Because it in no way is a holiday. His family went big for daylight savings. Big day for them. They spent food out. They had drinks. People over revelry. It was an event. He was at school day of like, yeah, I'm excited. It's daylight save. Spring ahead. My favorite of the two bitches. I don't even know how that works. You got to stay up till 2 a.m. You're having a good time. And then at 2 you have it again, I guess. I'm not sure. Or then it's 4 a.m. And you feel like you just did blow with your family? You're like, what are we doing? This is not... It's weird, everybody. I had a woman at my show. She told me about how her and her sisters would always get their hair cut from their grandma. All through their youth, which I thought was pretty sweet. It was like a family tradition. Then the grandmother passed away. And they were cleaning out her place. And they discovered that she kept all that hair. All of their childhood hair. And a set of drawers she hid in the closet. Or as I call it the hairdresser. I love that one, though. That's the best. That's the best. Dying with that leave behind. You just have to... You're like, grandma, why? She's like, bye-bye. You're like, why were you doing that? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. You're like, why were you doing it? You might not figure it out. Ta-ta. What was the hint? Maybe I was putting in pillows you'll never know. I'm gone, I'm vapor. But my favorite one was I was at a show and I was like, I got anywhere in traditions. And this guy goes, I got one birthday chicken. I was like, sir, you talk until you're done. Get him a microphone. You talk to people, birthday chicken? I was like, what is birthday chicken? And birthday chicken, it turns out, was in his family they invented like a birthday Santa. The birthday chicken. Sort of this mythical, generous foul, whom he believed to be real. So every year on his birthday, he'd get gifts from his friends and family, but then he'd get one extra gift from the birthday chicken. He thought it was totally normal, right? Then he gets a little bit older. Goes through the reveal that we all went through. Granted, his was a little different than ours. There was an addition. It was like, there's no tooth fairy. There's no Santa. There's no birthday chicken. He's like, I'm on need a minute. Santa, I saw a comment. But birthday chicken? Who is eating all the feed? We put in the living room. Dad? Oh my god. I'm going to get a birthday chicken. Then he gets a little bit older. He goes to high school, gets his license, goes to prom, goes to college. First semester, freshman year at college, in his dorm, it's his roommate's birthday. And he's like, his parents live far away. They might not have time to get him a birthday chicken gift. I'll do it. Because what I failed to tell you is what they failed to tell him, that they were the only people that did it. See, he knew it was bullshit. He just didn't know that it was only his family's bullshit. And that they'd invented the bullshit. That part never got revealed. So he's just handing this seeming stranger a gift with a card and this dude just opens it and he's like, love, birthday chicken. And he's like, I'm going to get a birthday chicken. I'm going to get a birthday chicken. I'm going to get a birthday chicken. And he's like, love, birthday chicken. I'm going to get a birthday chicken. And that's you. Thank you, birthday chicken. I love my sweater. Anyone have anything like that you can think of like little chai granite birthday chicken sets a high bar obviously Yeah, what do you got? Fucking amazing oh my lord dear Bradley. I hope this letter finds you well It won't soon You're still a nice boy, but I'm done with you What? What did the letters say? So your parents were like your parents your first of all I'm 90% one of your parents is a lawyer They're like legally if we get this notarized we're in the clear. We cannot he cannot sue us in the future So Then you have the illusion that Santa's real, but he's just done with you specifically which is almost worse Cuz kids are like kids are like when it's saying to get you like Santa and I aren't doing that anymore I've got a lead on a birthday chicken which is actually That's great It's just a lot of kids and you're not one of my favorites Santa sent me a restraining order. Yeah look you we're being an asshole to him. He said no more Oh, man, now I want to have kids just to do that that's like I'm gonna burn my rubbers to be like I'm gonna fuck with this kid be like Here's mine. This is my family tradition my family When I was growing up I'd go to England they would make us share bath water Yeah, yeah, that was like I was raised to believe that was totally normal to share bath water with relatives I Can't explain it, you know a lot of people won't take bath because like gross. That's your own filth, right? My own filth to me as a child would have been a dream a dream I Look at a bath of my own filth the way a gruel filled orphan had looked through a rich person's foggy window at a Christmas goose Just like me out filth gosh someday maybe imagine me on It's crazy It would be like my ants my female cousins they'd all share one bath then they drain it They do the great refilling and then it was man time And let me point out this is PMS pre-man scoping a much busier era, okay? And it would be like nine ten dudes. I'd be falling grown-ass men. I was a child But I didn't think it was weird it was the prison I was born into But by the time it got to me it didn't even look like bath water anymore It just looked like ramen at that point. It was just like Had it was the consistency of like cold sake by the time it got to me, you know what I mean? And then I just had to get in I just had to put myself into this human soup this dude stew this man of strony this guy spot show I'd go in there a seven-year-old new-bile boy take a skunk donkey come out of there covered it so many hairs of various lengths and curls I'd look like a greasian man in a nude beach just like let's do this, you know Buggers My uncle come over he'd take the hair off me give it to grandma obviously it was for her it was Herring is caring herring is caring They did everything earlier in England like they corrupted as youths much earlier in England You'd see like an eight-year-old smoke you'd be like that's crazy It'd be like god problem copper you'd be like I'm nine so you need to pump the brakes over there first of all Sex was earlier I remember I was 12 years old and my friend was like mate you still a virgin I was like yeah, I'm still a virgin. What do you I'm 12 years old? It was like don't worry it'll happen. I was like I don't want it to happen. Okay. I am a little boy All right, this is not chester these are my uncle's pubes. I took a bath earlier. I'm not I'm a kid bro Weed was earlier too weed yeah 12 13 was when we started smoking weed there the way we smoked weed there was different than how we smoked weed here The way I learned to get high in England was through what they call rising blowbacks now I know it sounds weird, but it's just when your buddy sucks. You're dick and a hot air balloon. That's all it is It says Guys, it's European. It's like pastries for breakfast. It's just it's their way. It does their way No, what it is is someone takes a joint right someone takes a couple hits off the joint puts the lid end in their mouth and blows through the back then you suck that in that someone picks you up by your stern until your feet are off the ground lowering your Oxygen levels and by the time your feet hit the ground again you are real high real high So imagine the first time in the States when someone wanted to smoke with me You know like you want to get baked? I was like well, yeah, but we're gonna need to get a few more fellows over here Chad We'll hurt our backs So So one of the first times I got high It's probably like first three times I got high was late at night everything's closed and we're hanging out in front of the store and I'm just laughing my ass off. We're having a good little time You know and I'm just laughing I tap the store window nothing aggressive just give it a little tap My friend Richard goes don't go with you. Lime a guff And I go don't call me a lime a guff And everybody laughed But they didn't laugh when he said it they laughed when I said it And I wanted to know what was going on, but I couldn't ask because I was high so I was just like Yeah, you don't call me a lime a guff What is it never mind But I wish I'd asked because it became like a nickname people started calling me lime a guff Yeah, for years people you know I'd get into the town people be like, I love a guff here I'd be like you damn right I am that's me I'm him You They'll be like you all right lime a guff I'd be like doing good little confused ill but good lime a guff's good Years went on till one night I was at a party and my cousin introduces me to a guy who was there that night And he goes, no, I'll remember you your llama guff. I was like here So then I waited until I had a moment and I cornered him I had to know and I go hey, why was that so funny? He goes what was what funny llama guff? I said why was it so funny when I said don't call me a lime a guff He said well because you hit the shot window and Richard said don't garrif the alarm will go off and You said don't call me a lime a guff I was like Well That is funny now that I hear it back that's pretty good honestly that's Pretty good weed too, well good to catch up hope you're well lime a guff out. I'll see you.

Or in like a small less than two thousand people festival serving bar a clown night You met at clown night Yeah, okay relax quit acting like I'm the crazy one like yeah, I always said that clown night dumbass we met at clown night And then you have noses on a clown night. Yeah, yeah, duh Well, what you think makes it clown night stupid man Can you imagine walking into a clown bar? I don't know if there's a I would make a you turn so fast I'm like we need to get the fuck out of here. They'd be like trivia night worse run run run start that car People loved you yeah, well lots of people think that they're wrong that happens all the time People love us we were loud How long how long goes that? No sir. I'm I mean I'm far, but I'm not like in another city Trained actor Plays thanks a bunch You are a clown you're still a clown You got it on now You had to get the bar through it is it like a barbell for your nose is this like a saw movie?

I think all drugs should be legal. I really do weed is a good example, right? They tried to scare us about legalizing weed and then you know they did right like leading up to the legalization of weed They're like you cannot legalize weed it'll be it's gonna be chaos This streets will be filled with snacks on these looking for things to eat It's gonna be total madness. They'll be after our twizzlers our our snickers our our sour patches our peanut butter filled pretzels Our cheese balls our bread all it rolls. It's gonna be they'll be breaking windows our seven elevens are gonna look like nine elevens You can't do this And then we did it and it was fun Right pretty much went fine the only thing that's changed is there's been a spike in cancelling plans Lot more plans get canceled now I don't know what it is about getting high with plans. It's like I'll have plans. I'll be excited that I have plans Then it'll be the night of the plans and I'll get high and I'll be like what was I thinking I got to cancel these plans I'm an idiot I Can't go anywhere Got a lie to your best friend, you know like a stone jessie small that you're like there was two of them They came after me. It was pretty bad. I can't Magahats the whole nine it was I could probably do coffee tomorrow before I get high. That's what the doctor says once I get out I like that medical phase that felt right to me medical phase, right? That was awesome. Oh, we were kids They still have that in some states that funny That's where you had to pretend to be sick and go see someone pretending to be a doctor It's fun. It's like marijuana larking Hot cause play right I just kept saying medically speaking a bunch during mine She's like, why do you need the license? I was like well medically speaking. Whoa, that's a pretty good start from this guy I need it because without it medically speaking I can't Can't get high without it medically speaking. It's genetic my dad had it. Please help me. Please help fix me. Please fix me I knew it was a bit of a force when I asked him if I could take my license picture in a top hat And they were like we literally don't care I walked out of there was like have a good day, gentlemen. I'm off to get rip shit. Yes I Looked for that license for a long time and then I found it like two weeks ago You validate that that is a man at a top hat That is a legal I should point out too. I'm wearing a tuxedo shirt and not like a shirt that you'd put a tie around the print of a tuxedo on a t-shirt They were like that guy doesn't need more weed. I was like I Will say I've enjoyed watching the evolution of getting weed in my lifetime I certainly I've been smoking weed long enough to have really seen it evolve, you know Like I think back to when I had to get weed in high school Yeah, impossible it was easier to get rare ivory than to get a bag of pot It was a weird system you had to go hang out with a dude That was how you got it you kind of like had to earn it by hanging out with some weird dude some dude who knew a dude But you'd have to physically be in his apartment That was how you got it, you know, he just would have like a fish tank full of baby sharks He'd be bench pressing in his living room while he was telling you a video game high scores You'd be like you think you're gonna get it today It'd be like won't be today. No could be days could be weeks. You're like you want to just call me when it gets here He's like, haha, that sounds crazy. No, I'll see you tomorrow. You're like okay To when I moved to Los Angeles, I still had to go meet a dude. It was a little easier the timeline was a little more condensed But I still had to go meet some random dude. He'd be like meet me in this parking lot at 4.30. I'd be like can do It'd be like 7.45. I'd be like you close. He'd be like no, I'd be like Okay, thank you. It's been a pleasure to work with you. I'm really enjoying this To now when it's just so easy to get it right like back then you'd go meet that dude You didn't know what kind of weed you were getting there were no types of weed I didn't know what kind of weed this guy was giving me there was one kind of weed the weedy gave you that was it That's crazy to think of that now That should be like imagine walking into a bar and being like one alcohol, please like that's what we were doing And now I really do feel like we've almost over corrected like it's easier to get weed now than it is to get quarters for laundry It's become so serious now like you walk into the weed store They're like all right in your blood type and star sign you're like no, no, I just please weed Sometimes you're in line behind the people who take it real seriously They get that magnifying broadcast that has a light switch on it, you know Just be like oh man. That's great. Look at those purple hairs. That's awesome. What county is this from love in the crystals? I just feel like I got to play that part when I get up there, you know, I'll be like well look at those crystals They're like sir. That's the tip jar. I'm like yeah, but it's still very shiny. That's awesome There's a lot of quarters in there, which is good for you all Could actually grab some of those I'm doing laundry later. I'm having trouble locating Supporters for myself personally as a blade Doesn't matter where you stand on weed everyone is taking gummies Smokers non-smokers everybody's rocking gummies people love the gummies Evangelical preachers will be like marijuana is a narcotic you may not be you can have a gummy you could take a gummy I'd take a gummy before I walk the dog makes it more interesting. It's in Lebedo kiss you can You may You know it's really rocking the gummies senior citizens We got him We got him candy that was how we got him Sitting right there so obvious candy Senior citizens love gummies I Was in a show talking about gummies 85 year old woman in my show goes I used to take gummies. I was like used to She goes I'd always take a half I was like okay. She goes then one day I took a hole. I was like, uh-oh. She goes. Uh-oh is right Called 911 I was like what? What did you tell them? She goes I told them I took a gummy they knew what to do they knew what to do It's that common that they know what to do There's probably like attempted triage attached to most hospitals now Senior citizens sprawled out on gurneys having just OG'd over gummy Some exhausted doctor running around there like get me 15 insurers all the soft food you could find it for God's sake put mash on I I'm on a break from wait I took a break from wait I've just smoked enough weed in my lifetime that I'm like good for a while, you know I love weed. I love weed I'm the guy who before the show tonight you'd all be waiting to come inside But you'd have to wait for me because I'd be outside hitting the bowl like a crack pipe And you just be like how high do you need to be for this and I'd be like I'm not getting high for now I'm getting high for two hours from now, okay? Like how a camel drinks a bunch of water before it goes into the desert. I'm filling my weed humps There are some things I like about not smoking weed for sure like I like walking into a room and knowing why that's addictive I'll be honest. They were right about that one Or like remembering where I parked my car in a parking garage. That's good. I like that one too Every movie I ever saw it always walk out and be like all right This part Walk around for five minutes eventually flag down the security guard getting their cart, you know Just be like make a model sir. I'm not sure I might not have even driven here tonight. This might be a fool's errand You smoke not all right The only time I would take breaks other than this last one would be when I would go see my mother in England She wouldn't score me. Wait. She was real square, you know So last time I went there I took CBD with me, you know a lot of people like CBD doesn't work You don't feel anything that's not true. You take enough CBD. You feel like you really wish you had weed You are like that'd be great. We'd it be great My mother she saw that I had CBD she goes gutney mole like it was a quailuited studio 54. I was like lady Literally buy this at the grocery store So I gave everyone right I'm not kidding you could give this CBD to a durable there be no noticeable difference My mother tripped tripped She was fried like an egg she was laying out on her couch Just like oh my god. I go are you okay? She goes the colors are so vivid. I was like this is a white room But she couldn't hear me. I just looked in her eyes and all she was hearing was banan amam Purnal Same trip though right right before I'm flying back my cousin gives me a weed edible that he made for me Now that is a dicey situation I want to know the potency always right my rule of edibles is you can always take more nevertheless Right choo choo wait like a delayed amp track. That's how I handle it But this is for a flight international travel so you got to make a decision before you go into customs How much you want to eat? Because you can't have it on you in your pocket, but you can't have it in you inside God's pocket So I got to decide so I'm like fuck it. Let's go big So I eat the whole thing oopsie poopsy. Yeah, it was a it was a bad call no doubt bad call I made the wrong call. I got the highest I've ever been The highest I've ever I was so high that I didn't know I was high like I crossed through the event horizon I was that high And I know a lot of people who even spoke we're like what does that mean? I wouldn't know what it means unless it happened to me But I got so high that I needed to figure out that I was high and There were a few red flags on the way to the moment of revelation The first one was I was sitting on the plane and I couldn't find my phone Anywhere I was checking every I tore my bag apart. I was looking under my seat You know and then eventually found it in my pocket And I was just like wait huh it was like I did a magic trick on myself. I was like how did I do that? That was my phone. Yeah The second red flag was I was sitting there and I became obsessed with the idea of taking off my boxer shorts and only wearing my pants The idea of this consumed me I was obsessed It was either think about it the whole flight or do it so I had to go do it So I got up went to the plane bathroom went inside there joined a different mile high club, okay? Now what went on in there can only be described as a slapstick silent film comedy There should have been a piano player outside like It's like he gets popping up and stuff like that I Was banging around in there giggling my ass off knocking shit down. I was like oh my god. This isn't going to well, you know But eventually got him off right had the boxers didn't really know what to do with them So I just sort of jammed him in my pant pocket Like I had a clown hanky, you know Thank you to some of us all right sir wait get that clown the fuck out of here I'm kidding he may stay He's in a party of 30 they all get in his car all right come on guys. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go Had that clown hanky out of my pants my plan was if anyone asked me what it was I was just gonna go Go to bed of a runny nose But that wasn't it where I realized was I was sitting there okay, and I'm watching a movie and as I'm watching a movie I'm like the worst part about the mask is how much it fogs up your glasses then I'm like you're not wearing glasses You don't wear glasses Then I started thinking back. I was like my phone the clown hanky. Oh my god. I'm high I was so high that I've been on a lot of planes But I was so high on this flight that I was looking out the window like we're so high right now We'd already landed by the way. I was like oh my god the people look like people from up here man The flight attendant came over she said something to me. I couldn't understand it all I heard was banana And I'm bam bam bam bam I was trying to get weed in Mexico once not easy right I was searching all over eventually I bought it off a cab driver I should have known it was not good weed when I got into the garbage bag. I was like this is trying to get me a great weed It wasn't it was terrible, right? But I was like there were like seeds and stems in it. I was like oh yeah, those things right But so I rolled a bunch of joints I was smoking them I was smoking in my hotel room down at the beach I was walking down the street smoking joints Maybe getting a little too comfortable right at one point I'm walking by and I see this like little disco tech and I'm like oh maybe I'll go in there You know, I was like look at those lights. It's pretty cool, you know, and then I'm like oh wait It's like a barber shop. Why is a barber shop at like disco lights? And I'm like oh wait those aren't even disco lights. Those are like sirens I'm like oh wait those aren't even coming from inside. They're actually a reflection I'm like oh wait reflections means it behind you and I was like oh wait those are cops I was like oh wait. I have weed and I just threw it like four feet from me And then the cops came over you know, they found it they were pretty good detectives obviously they thorough and So they cuff me put me in the back of the cop car right driving me away now the one guy his job is to just drive But the other guy his job is to just disparage the quality of the weed to my face So he's just holding the bag up and he's like man, this is some bad weed. I was like yeah, it has not been good to me I agree. It's not great He's like this is you can't believe you're going to jail for this oregano. I was like yeah, no, it's not good I'm not proud of it. It really is not worth it and anyway, you know It was just like what did you pay for these long clippings? I was like sir I feel like whatever I say to you're gonna overreact because that seems to be your attitude But $40 he goes $40. I was like I knew that that was what you do Then at one point they pull over and he goes look We don't want to take you to jail and I was like well, sir We finally have some common ground because you're not gonna believe this. I don't want to go to jail So look at us He goes if you go to that ATM and get out $200. We'll let you go I was like that's can do So I went I got $200 out of the ATM gave it to him right there. Let me go as I was walking away He goes hey, you forgot something and he threw the weed at me And as I was picking it up, I thought this is a better judicial system I just got arrested interrogated processed had my hearing posted bail got released and my shit back in 45 minutes. We should be doing that honestly Way better are you waving to me? Oh You that's a thumbs up. Oh, you got to understand people are clapping and you're like giving me the queen wave I was like what That's a better that's better than clapping. I want that people more people to do that. Yeah, that's good Are you here with someone I can't really see Three other people three other people. Okay. How do you all know each other? In like 10 years and this is the first time you're seeing each other 10 years at this show. Yeah, how did this happen?

That's great What do you think so far you having a good time? Okay. Yeah, I tell you having a good time because you waved at me So I know you're That's how I could tell you're like hello All right, now we're gonna talk about the rest. This is just uh, that's a bit of a hodgepodge of popery My mother stuff. So I'm a single man. I lived with a female friend of mine for the past couple years It was fine. Obviously. It's been a while since I lived to the woman. There were certain things I forgot like I always consider women to be cleaner than men and I think for the most part that is true Right tidier at least, but I will say the bathroom is where that playing field gets real level That's where women come to life, right Like there's a lot of stuff. I was just like what is going on like they're always fingerprints on the mirror Which I was like as a man. I've never touched the mirror I don't even know how that happens. She's just in there like someday Oh Women also get very ambitious with that bathroom trash can Yeah, you do you believe in that thing To me it's a baby trash I don't have high expectations for this receptacle Q tips floss that's it Empty at once a year Kind of a big deal when you empty right it's like a ceremony you're like come on. We have to get your sister. We're empty in baby trash out back Gather round. You know you're like baby trash out of good. You have fine. Yeah, baby trash out, huh Good harvest. I think right we can use the same CVS back for another year. I think right It's got that little hole in it It's not the women fill it is that you pack it in like sand What is the long-term strategy here just like live to fight another day Brenda ah smush You work for make I just walked in there one day it's lid wouldn't even close. I was like what are you doing to baby? You're killing baby trash look like it been curb stomped. I was like look at him look at him I eventually had to empty it was not easy to do it's concreted in there Had to put on like a weight lifting belt have a buddy come over to spot me. I was shaking shaking shaking right It's like giving a nerd a swirl. I was like drop drop drop When it finally dropped it was like a magician's pocket. I couldn't believe all the stuff that was in there Nail polish people magazines. I was like is that about a red wine what the fuck are you doing in here? This is a bathroom. This is a bathroom Lot of hair too lot of hair. Yeah, it seems like a nightmare, but it is a lot of hair You ever get a haircut in your hand you can't get off Yeah, haircon and you can't get off right you just work on it for 10 minutes like get off of there You know Finally you do it then you rub in your fingers together 30 seconds later. You're like that bastard still there won't leave Women have come up with an amazing technique for when that happens to them in the shower to get rid of that hair Haven't you Yes, you already know you already know Women ain't got time for that they're in the shower they got stuff to shave Women ain't got time for that so they'll just take those finger hairs and just strewn them along the shower tile Hair by hair strand by strand one by one lock by lock Sort of decking the halls in there. It's got a festive nature to it Over the months it takes on the appearance of jungle vines in some parts You One day I just looked over I was like what the fuck is going on over here what Some of the side hairs almost look like like bad cursive. It's like a dead language Looks like cave paintings from a far gone culture. I'm just like she'd look at this. She I need the Rosetta stone She's trying to down. May something she's communicating through hair. It's like hair aglipics I Eventually had to get rid of it came up with a technique. I call the dick sprinkler I'd just be in the shower one day and be like all right fucking I just fill my palm with water and be like got it Got it got it got it you know Those hairs are dropped down right then eventually the shower drain clogs that was the next chapter So Suddenly the water is at calf level whenever you're taking a shower You're not taking a shower anymore. You're taking what can only be described as a shaft, you know Stopping around in there furiously like the grape stop and lady you're like god damn it. This is on a life I'm gonna get trenchfoot. This is bullshit I had done clog it, you know, she came in just like what do you think it was? I was like I don't know Maybe it's this treasure trolley who that lives down there think it might be that it just blinked, huh It said mama right I throw it in the baby trash, but there's no fucking room All right, let's talk about America. Uh land that I love land that I love land that I'm a little concerned about I'm not gonna lie. Let me start by saying this I have stopped flying. I don't fly to shows anymore not because of the edible box or Thing that's That's irrelevant other reasons I stop flying Because they cancel 1800 flights a day. I just got sick of the gate swapping of the missing bags Not being able to locate pilots sitting on the tarmac for five hours Just got sick of it and the thing that really drove me crazy is the whole time they're screwing you They are thanking you for your patience Well, thank you for your patience while you don't get to your destination We want to thank you for your patience while you don't get your bag It's like that's not how patience works. There's nothing more infuriating than being thankful patience that you're not giving So I stopped I stopped I stopped as soon as I realized that the FAA wasn't an acronym. It was just short for fuck you So I quit so now I drive to all my shows I drive to all my shows and I am seeing a lot of the country a lot of it and let me tell you it ain't good Not good things are not good everything is broken It's all broken elevators don't work escalators are weird stairs Most bathrooms are out of order hand sanitizer dispensers are empty that one I particularly hate Going up for a score to hand sanitizer because you feel like your hands dirty Go up and you're like oh take some of that and then you're just touching it and nothing's coming out and you're like wait So now my hand is touching all the hands of people who thought they were dirty enough to warrant hand sanitizer And now their germs and my germs are just having a germ orgy no And they're just not gonna fix shit the government is just done fixing stuff That's their plan both parties they're done fixing shit right the only thing our political parties are fixing our prices and primaries That's it And I don't actually Even call them political parties anymore parties are full of young people having fun. That's not what this is These are old people doing nothing who belong in the ground. So I call them political funerals And I am not a member of either of our political funerals and it's very freeing because I'm able to agree with everyone's gripes Right people be like Republicans are religious cult sliding into fascism. I'm like yes. Yep. Yes They'll be like Democrats use their wokeness to get away with their out in the open corruption. I'm like right exactly. Yep. Mm-hmm Yes And I know people are like well no my team's good. They care of course they do they care about you They love you just like the birth they chicken loves you He loves you his love is real his love is great And we enable it in this country we let him get away with it because we still have a lot of people walking around this country Saying that this is the best country on earth here that all the times best country on earth America is not even the best country in America anymore, okay? It isn't most people who are saying that America is the best country on earth just haven't left it And that's not fair that would be like an Amish man being like the best sex in my life was with my wife right here And my favorite position through a hole in a sheet for pro creation. It's like you need something to compare it to Can't just do that And I'll tell you people get pissed off when you talk like this they do they don't like it I've done this material it shows. I've had people shout if you don't like it get the fuck out It was a napa known for its wines But why is it like that why can't I complain? Are we that sensitive? Why can't I give this country tough love? It doesn't work like that with people if you have people in your life that you care about and they're fucking up You give them tough love you talk to them you make it hard for them You tell them the hard truths they need to hear to get better because you love them But in this country you can't do that like let's say I had a buddy named Dan and every time we go out Dan jumps behind the bar steals a bottle of vodka pounds it whips his dick out Mushes it in the bar olives and calls it a mantini extra dirty I'd probably pull him aside I'd say something to him. I'd be like hey, Dan. That's not cool. You can't do that I mean did I laugh at the mantini part? Sure I did I'm only human I wouldn't stand in front of him and be like if you don't like it get the fuck out D-A-N I'm just saying if we're gonna live in a collapsing empire let's at least just be honest about it Because right now America is walking around like it's blue swedish shoes Elvis Look's good is new one of a kind shakes its hips and everybody feels real nice But in reality we are late stage Vegas Sitting in a stain jumpsuit passed out on a toilet full of barbictuates clinging to a half-eaten ham and peanut butter sandwich Elvis with With a few rich dick standing around us looking thinking how can we get one more hit out of this half-dead shell And Elvis for America is a good comparison because they both got where they did by stealing from black people so And I know some people are like Jesus. We're enough with this guy, right? Look I'm just up here working on material and while I do I thank you for your patience. Thank you The upside is we live in a time when we're probably gonna get to watch a billionaire explode in space so That's pretty exciting right Are you waving for that one miss no wave on that one? Okay. Yeah thumbs up. I like to see it. She's like yeah no fuck them Fuck them Yeah We might get to see a billionaire explode in space. That's exciting screw fireworks. That's what I want I watch every launch live I watch every launch live. I want to see it live. I don't want to catch the highlights later. I want it live I'm making food. I have drinks out. I have people over. It's an event. It's like daylight savings. I'm really I go big Nothing would make me happier to watch one of those things just pop If I had to pick I want to pay us I'm being greedy I'm being greedy, but so is he I want to pay us give me Jeffrey. It's wearing that dumb cowboy hat up to space like I was like oh give me give me give me I Would just love to see that thing pop in that hat feather down to earth right It's watching it. It's like Be like whoa got here so fast same day like prime I appreciate y'all showing up for this line. But what about thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you oh Weddo you
Let's welcome Neil Brennan. What's up, guys? What's up, man? How you feeling? All right. White guy giving me the peace sign. Good to see you. Hey, thank you all for coming out. I'm glad you're here. The economy's awful, isn't it? No, it's a great surprise about the economy. It's when they talk about it on the news. Back like everybody's rich. You notice that? Well, they'll be like global economic meltdown. Is your money safe? What are you in the $43? I have my checking account? It should be okay. Thank you. Then you turn the channel and they're like, has the value of your property gone down? Huh? I don't know. Let me ask my goddamn landlord. You know what the worst part of having a landlord is? People think it's the money. It's so not the money. Where's the problem of having a landlord? Is having to call the landlord. Landlord. It's a bit of an exaggerated title, isn't it? For a guy who rents out rooms to strangers for money? Landlord? Like there's something medieval about the whole thing? Whenever I see my landlord now just to mess with them, I'm always like, my lord. My lord, I come to the from the kingdom of apartment 4J. My lord, if you wouldn't mind taking off your cape, I need you to unclog my toilet. Yeah. I watch the news a lot too much. Yeah, the news. CNN is my network. Because CNN, even when it's bad news, it's kind of good on CNN. You know, it's got the saddest news on earth. You were accidentally watch that British news. No dog run, the BBC news. The sad ass British accents on there. Just the way they pronounce countries on their bummed me out, like, Afghani stand. I love it. Like they could make any news stories on sad on the BBC. Like today, packs of wooden imps travel the hillsides of New Jersey, handing out chocolate chip cookies and f*** jobs. We got to say it on New Jersey. Jesus. A lot of time on the internet as well. I heard about this website recently called It Gets Better. You guys know what this is? If you don't know what it is, it's a website where gay teenagers that are getting bullied by Tracy Morgan, kidding. I'll bestap you. No, gay teenagers that are getting bullied at school then go online and adult gay celebrities that the video's form going like, hey, I know you're getting bullied now, but just so you know, it gets better. Which sounds nice, but it's actually just some empty Hollywood stuff. If I was one of the gay kids that would be like, so celebrity, you can't help me today. Celebrities are like today. No, we're afraid the bullies as well, but best of luck to you. You know, a website would be way more effective than it gets better. Website called It Gets Worse. Where all the people that were super popular in high school had to leave videos about what losers they became later on in life. That'd be great. Actually, wait, they have that. It's called Facebook. Bang! So there was some music award show recently. The song is or something. Are you not sick of these music shows? These awards are like, there's like no good songs. Then they're just giving them awards. Like, let's give Neo a prize. Let's not. So, you know what else does it encourage about that? Remember what people used to do there? So longs in these shows and get off stage. That's not enough for these ego min eggs. The show was how hard they worked. So like Usher will finish his song. He's applauding and instead of getting off stage, Usher stands there and does this. It's like Usher, you lip sync the song. You didn't witness a murder. Get off stage. Yeah. Fellas, nobody, no. Fellas, no woman on earth wants to look at her phone and see a picture of your dick. Yeah. Yeah. Ever. Our bodies are disgusting. They're not made to be photographed. That's a women's body. We're women's bodies are beautiful. They got curves and padding and their own cafeteria. They have a lot happening. Our bodies are not made to attract women. Our bodies are made to see attractive women. Chase them down with our superior speed. So do them with our superior strength. Try to make a baby. Here we go. This is the face I make. I love you. So, um, single. No, I'm single. So girls will send me pictures of their boobs sometimes. And it's the best. That never happens to my married guy friends. I shouldn't say it never happens. My married guy friends, their wives, will send them pictures of their boobs. But it's always with a note that says like, I think my rash is back. So girls will send me pictures of their boobs. And then I got to send something back. This is about all we have to send. So, but fellas, women don't want that. They, so put something in the frame. If you're going to take a picture of it, the women actually like, put like a scented candle down there. Or like a gift certificate for Sephora. Yeah. Or like a bigger dick. Something. Women are sensual creatures. You understand me? So, they don't want the organ. They want a hint of sexuality. So, if you got abs, take a picture of your abs. You know what else women like? Women like this thing. Whatever this is, the ramp. Yeah. The on ramped dick city. For the black girls, the de-angelo muscle. Huh? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is romantic. But this is like the notebook. This is a walk to remember. This is Alien 3. We live in a porn-y ass world, don't we? Just gets porn here by the day. Hey, by the way, if you work in porn, I don't know of you and your co-workers know this. But we have enough porn. You don't have to keep making it. You did a great job. We appreciate your service. But you can shut it down. If you make porn or if you make those crocs shoes, we're good. Porn used to amaze me. I'd be like, how'd they get that man and that lady to have sex at that bakery? But now the older I get the more I realize, men and women have sex at the easy part of relationships. You know what's like a fantasy to me now? You know what we'll be porn to me today? Just video of a man and a woman getting along. Like, wait, he has to work late and she's not going to take it personally? Oh, that's hot. Wait, they went to a party together and they want to leave it the same exact time? Oh, my God, where they find these people. Wait, she wants to talk about the new duvet cover. He doesn't give a crap and she doesn't give a crap that he doesn't give a crap? Oh, that's going to make me finish. So we want you ladies. And we want you. And we don't know how to get you. We used to just be able to chase you down and grab you. But I made that illegal like 10,000 years ago. So now we got to be romantic. We don't know anything about that. And there's no end in amount of romance versus give you ladies. Because we'll take you out to dinner. Right, we're going to pay. Which for a guy is like insanely romantic. But it's not enough. You know, I know it's not enough. Because they always let that lady into the restaurant. What lady? Creepy as lady on earth. God damn flower lady. Turn it worse than that woman. Whenever I say I'm like, who let her in here? Procise for the lady. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah. Do women even want the roses at the restaurant? No. No, a lot of nose. You know why, fellas? Because the roses are too convenient. Yeah. Women only like presents if they're super inconvenient to get. Yeah. Yeah. Women want us to wait in line for six hours or like drive to the next state. They just want a story they can tell their girlfriends and brunch about how much we suffered for them. Like, oh, you don't know about these earrings? These are the earrings that would Mike Goddard for me. He fell on the escalator and lost part of his hand. I don't even like the earrings, but I like the mic was legally dead for two minutes to do that. It's such a one way street. That's the thing. Some make real sensitive to guys' issues. One part of the year is just about giving presents to women. I'm doing thanks, giving it Valentine's Day. Every commercial on TV is about giving presents to women. Give her a December to remember. A diamond is forever. Mary kiss begins with cake. You know why all the commercial are for women? Because you can't advertise what guys want. Yeah. Like legally, you're not allowed. You'll never see commercial like ladies. This holiday season give him the gift he's waiting for all year. A day of silence followed by a three-way with you and your hottest friend. You followed by more silence. Only from JC Penny. Ladies and gentlemen, we don't want to talk to you. We don't want to talk to our guy friends. Not about anything real or emotional. What are your sports or for? Completely meaningless. Football sounds like it's invented by an eight-year-old girl. There's a ball. And you get four tries to take the ball of ten yards. In between each try, we're going to be a huddle. We're going to be a secret about the other team. By the way, we're all wearing capri pants. And half time the black eyed peas are going to play. I don't know what we want to talk to us about. We're jerks. Guys are jerks. You want to know what guys are really like? Look what we're doing when there's no women around. We're just going to slap each other and insulting each other's appearance and trying to injure one another's testicles. Women are nice. Look at men's surprises. Look at women's surprises. Women's surprises are nice. Women's surprises are like today with Gil's birthday. And we all pretend like we forgot. And then at 4.30 we were about to cup cakes. And she was so surprised. And a guy's surprise is like, Joe wasn't paying attention so he lit his back on fire. And then we found out his birthday. We said his car on fire too. He was really surprised. Hey, where are we on Obama? We like him? You vote for him, brother? You vote for him? Yeah. Brother, you vote for him? Yeah. Every brother I know vote for. Did brothers even need to punch the batter? You just walk in and be like, All right, put me down for my man. Bitch, you know what the f*** this is. All right. I like the dude. I vote for him. But in some ways he's like, America's a rebound boyfriend. You know what I mean? We just want to be able to call George Bush. And be like, here with someone else, not George. And get this. He listens to us. And he doesn't just attack people for no reason. And oh yeah, did I mention he's black? Click. Yeah. You know, the other thing is he gets blame for a lot of stuff. But I feel like 70% of the stuff he gets blame for is bush's fault. Yeah. Yeah. It's sad because it's just another case of a brother being the wrong place the wrong time. Getting accused of some stuff he didn't do. America's like, freeze, put your hands against White House. Like it was George Bush and Dick Cheney. They just f***ed left. Yeah. And they sometimes say, I followed the administration pretty closely. And they say like, you know, he's too insulated against his critics. And then, but he, so he relies on Sasha and Malia and Michelle to keep him humble. But that might keep him humble. But you know what I'm really humble is if Sasha and Malia were white. They're like 12 and 14. They're sweet girls. But if they were white, there's no one meaner on earth than 12 and 14. They're like the meanest little bitches on the planet. Because now he comes on when he's like Sasha Malia study, hard getting no good school. And they're like, yes, yes, Danny, we love you. But if they were white, he'd come on be like Sasha Malia study, hard getting no good college. And they're like, for what? You ruin the economy. There's not any job we get out and you jackass. We're going to can't do it. Hopefully you won't wreck America while we're gone dumbass. Oh, look, Sasha. It's Danny's birthday. It's psych. You don't have one foreigner. Like I said, I like the dude. Votiform. Can I vote for him again? But I'm going to say, yeah. I'm in this, yeah. In some ways, the expectations were so high that I haven't been this disappointed in the president since all of the other presidents. But with Obama, the thing is I gave him money. That's what it hurt. Like I believe in the dude so much that I donated to his campaign. Obama was basically the stripper that I was like, no, fellas. This one really likes me. He wants some co-pump, hey baby, you need some change? Hey, co-pump, co-pump, co-pump, co-pump, co-pump. You killed Ben Laden. That was something. Yeah. Then I got mad at Barack because he didn't release the photos. But again, Barack's a nerd, man. The president, Erkel. But America's a bloodthirsty. They wouldn't have been having less Barack came out with like a tear drop tattoo. It was like, yeah, there's been Laden stuff done, son. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not doing it. It's black stuff. So Obama. Black dude. Of course, and I've worked with black dudes before, not your pal show. Of course, which I was the, you're just painting. The reason all the people are wanting is because I co-create the pal show. racial sketches because we used to do the best racial sketches on Chappelle, we did like the blind whites and premises, we did the bloopers from Roots. And I, and I, I still think of these crazy ass racial sketches and I got nowhere to go with them, but I thought one recently, that'll pitch to you guys if you wanna hear it. Yeah. Alright. Alright, but don't be babies, alright? Cause, cause this is racial. Alright. I wish we could have done a sketch about how scared white people must have been on the last day of slavery. Cause it was a real day. It's January 30th, 1865. Like, what do white people do that day? Can I see all the slaves in the front please? Oh Jesus. Well, we had a heck of a run, didn't we? I just wanna say you guys did a fantastic job with the chores. These last 250 years. You'll be free tomorrow. Please don't murder us. Violence doesn't solve anything. Oh really, what all the time you're whipping us? T-Shay, Toby. T-Shay. Now, have you guys went mind clearing out your stuff the Mexican should be here any minute to apply to?

What's up? Do I look like a fucking lady or what? Ladies in the house tonight? I like being a fucking lady. Especially in the 90s, we can give the say what the fuck we want, too, don't we, girl? That's right. And still being lady. That's right. Because you don't know all day they couldn't say the shit they wanted to say. They had to fake orgasms and shit. We can tell Niggas today, hey, I want to come, motherfucker. Shit, we got Oprah. I watch Oprah, because I ain't got no mean. But that's all right, because between Oprah and my gynecologist, I'm satisfied. That's right, I learned to appreciate that fucking pap smear. I'm out once a year, boo, and shit, I see you tomorrow, motherfucker. Shit. Shit. Ten inches of arm, heart, same shit. When he finish, I smoke a fucking cigarette. And some wasn't good for you, too. And some women like for a play, you know. If you create a button, you can get for a play with that fucking pap smear. Oh, yeah. I do say some shit like dark cup. Could I get a breast exam before the pap smear? Maybe a not anist, motherfucker. Why don't you check it out? I know, I know. I know what you're saying. She's so fucking feminine and lady-like. She's such a fucking lady, yes I am. Live in and lady. I like the shop, cause ladies like the shop, don't we girls? But don't you hate the pictures that work in the store following you around? Actually, you stupid shit. Trying to keep you from stealing and shit. I hate them holes. Bitches on commission, what I call them. You try some fucked up shit. Who cares? What you wear, bitch, okay? I try to avoid them. You know I go to a rack and take eight or nine items off the rack and go in the fitting room. But they're not gonna fucking do a wanted thing. How do those fit? Like, gee, they fit perfect, but my purse won't zip up now, bitch. Do you have a bigger bag I could use? Don't fuck with me when I'm being feminine and lady-like. I love being a lady now, you know, cause you could say shit that you couldn't, for example, I could tell y'all right now that sometimes I'm in a shower and I gotta pee. I don't get out that muppet. Fuck off. Shit. I figured a water going down here. You wanna fucking wait, you know what I'm saying? Shit, why would I not tell it, don't you know? I know what you're thinking. She's such a fucking lady. That's right, I was raised that way. I like, cause men, I like men, I like y'all. I ain't got none right now, but I like y'all. Y'all cool, but y'all do some stupid shit. Especially when you got a little old dick. You know, you do some stupid shit that little dick men do. You ladies, you ever walkin' down the street? Two guys in a car ride up. How come it's always that motherfuckin' a passenger sad to say, hey baby, wanna ride? What the fuck am I doing? Take your old place motherfucker? Ain't that what you doin'? Get in the fucking ride? Stupid shit, man. Stupid. And I know about now y'all, I've got some big ass lips. Yeah, I know that's some big motherfuckers, see? I know that's some big motherfuckers. Yeah, all my lips are big, man. That's right. See, see? He has to get out of my fucker, calling about blowjob, and he whannos' about a sad foe. Little old feet, so you know it's dick smart. I couldn't get him no blowjob. My big ass lips, his little old dick, it wouldn't work. At the light trying to give a well of tic-tac motherfuckin' and she wouldn't work. It wouldn't work. It wouldn't work. That was crazy. He had my last... I can't buy for that, man. Hey, my name's Adele Getter, the John Reston Show. You
Every single tick-tock comment is requesting me to do more Red Flag crowd work. Don't get me wrong, I love doing crowd work. It's one of my favorite parts of the show. I get to interact with the audience, get to know them a little bit, but now it's getting to the point where everybody is coming to shows and just yelling out Red Flag some kind of over it, to be honest. Why don't you do it one more time? Like you're in Miami, just Red Flag's, that's it, retire it. Do a whole show improvised about Red Flag's, and retire the bit. And never do it again. It's like a Red Flag special. Yeah. I fuck it Miami, let's hear your Red Flag's. If you don't have a Red Flag, it's basically a warning sign. Meet somebody, you start talking to them. If something about their personal, it's just kind of triggered for the warning. You hear like maybe this is the person I should be flutter. So for the women in the audience, what might be some Red Flag's for a guy? You say flip flops everywhere? What you gonna talk to the beach? Jesus Christ, why are your thoughts out of red flags? You are dogs out of red flags. That's right, wow, hey dogs, everybody. This has been an experience you had when on a daily Vagai and you wore flip flops too. Yeah, there was a dude who was like, Buzz10. He was a 10. He had all 10 toes. I was like, I can get you kids in dance and start. I was like, oh, I got on the trapeze with him. Hold on, it's like he was a 10. He was Ivy League Educator. He's a good looking guy. He has a great job. She was like, I'm about to trap this man. And then he showed up with flip flops and she went, oh, never mind. He thought he was fucking mine. If he's Ivy League Educator, maybe he knows how to think of a waste of money. Shoes all hard. Yeah, he's the only sound he's all that's right. Where's your meeting? Um, what's the highest school together? You went to high school together? He had shoes that... Where did you get the school? Go to the bathroom. Batter, academy. What is that? Sounds like you think shoes don't matter. That's crazy. I love how he had all these great things about him. And then she saw one little toe and she flipped flops all the entire relationship. It was not fucking crazy. The irony. Toes really turned you off that much. First of all, it's an emergency. He's not keeping the flip flops on. She's more worried that there's going to be an active shooter. I mean, they're going to be trying to sneak out the back and he's getting like... I'm... I'm talking about... Oh my God. Or maybe he's more prepared than you think. I know a lot of Latino women in here who can use a flip flop as a fully functioning weapon. He's actually... He's actually just feeling buried. I mean, it's so prepared for anything. I think he gave me another chance. I would love it before you all fought to put all socks. Like that was thank you. This simple fucking battle. Are you actively like a socks have to be off in bed person or are you like you don't care? He's not a real knocky-haw. It's not a deal breaker. Maybe it's fatter cold. This actually is a great time to plug you guys on my Shark Tank idea. Because I've never said this before. Nobody can fucking steal it. Because I'm a sock guy. Like I don't like my bare feet being out. I don't like flip flops. So I am on your side on this. But my thing is, if I'm about to have sex, I don't actively be like, Oh my God, I take my socks off. I keep them all on. It's just something to... Hey, what you don't fuck y'all anyways? Okay, relax. Everybody in here, oh, what happened? You can have your fucking hoops out if you want. But I keep on, and for a couple of reasons, what my feet are cold. And two, I keep them on for traction. Which is what brings me to my pitch to you guys. I'm looking for a 900,000 dollar investment. Oh, do you guys know hospital socks? No, they're like, they're a world damn thing. They're rubber on the bottom, right? I wanted to get my own like hospital socks with that rubber grip on the bottom. So that way you put them on right before you fluck and it gives you a good... a good dig in. So you can just suck and really put in work. And you call them sheet-cleans. You know, you keep all that sex issue that you want. So I fucked a 1440, okay? Nobody's stealing that. It's a million dollar idea. Oh, there's socks on. What up? Is this a real thing? Keep your socks on, helps you come faster. No, it doesn't. That's the dumbest thing you're ever heard of my entire life. That is so fucking stupid. Hey, the bass was holding me back. Is that a real situation? It actually is like the ancient bull in the back with bars and mom. If you're too cold to bedroom, it's harder to come. Yes. I don't know. I can come fast in an include. Like, I have to stop and make a town. Did you ever see that guy again? It was not the only day he went on the woods. What's the condition of frying mine? He was just a friend of yours. I've been being here. Your stay going out? I'll be following the shoes of your dream. I like that one. It's very anti-fetish. Well, I like that. That's exactly the time we're ever playing on Blokin' Square. Some of the time she just went, this is something I can see being a problem for me down the line. And it just gives me the ink just enough. That's good. We're one for one. Who can talk to the flops? What's the problem? What's the problem? What's the problem? Legos in his bedroom? Well, maybe don't fucking use in the first place. He was made in the heart. He elaborate. All right, she was 23. He was 23. I didn't have a Lego village in his bedroom. He had a Lego village in his bedroom. Okay, so you don't fuck with architecture. Did you ever play with him? Ungrateful. But it was like a town that he had built. All right, sex aside. Was it kind of impressive? It was a little bit. That's what I'm talking about, see? Judging too much. Where'd you meet him? New York City? A lot of buildings. Is that what you're from? Nice. What are you doing out here? Working? Oh, what do you do? Uh, crypto. Crypto? I want to roast you when you're going to be poor in four years. Not really. I don't really know what I'm talking about. Oh, my God. You mad at this dude for building a imaginary city. You play with a imaginary money. Fucking hypocrisy, am I right? That's insane. Did you cross your mind? I feel like this wasn't a problem until you did your walk in shame. Mara putt you like... What'd you mean to Matt, do you remember? House party? House party? A real house? A Lego house? Why did they cross your mind? So we're in a flag of Lego to this room? Was it just that? Did they come across this childish, when it's sharp? Are you afraid you were going to swallow something accident? You were in his parents house. They were in his parents house. Oh, he's still at the home. Get that's the red flag. Is that a bell? It's not a bell from Lego. Let me explain. What would you say to the bitch? Did you say comedie? Try to use the lights on right now. It's what I got. Why is the comedian a red flag? You know, like fun again? You want to be the funniest one? You losing already. This is not a good stuff. What's that? You don't have a stage? I feel like you dance all one. Well, I'd be pissed if my stripper was like, not normal. But instead of the noise, just goes, who's there? C-section. You're a booze. Be nice to me. What do you actually go? You're a Megan Forest? It's not very funny. What makes you want to do that? Are you good at drawing? You've always been autistic? I'm autistic. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I heard something totally expensive. Okay. Okay. You still wanting? We'll see. You must be a good Megan Varsky. You're making me look good right now. That was less of a red flag than we were shot. Very fancy asking for sports. Did you sound heard recently? Somebody just sent their main statement like, a winger bone. Also, how are you now doing? Let's try to do this divorce. What happened? I found out three days ago, my husband of six years, we have two beautiful boys, his cane for ass forts. How much? How much? How much? I don't know. I saw the text message under the new update on iPhone. Under edit, and now we're getting free. We're calling the checkers. What was that? We were calling for three hundred per hour. Three hundred per hour? Do they end up by the minute? It was like 20. You know, I mean, I got 5. Do you see the pictures? There's no pictures that he wanted, but he's saying it's a scam. It's a scam? That means he didn't come. This is a ripple. He just did, I can't stay married, I want to not come. There's some married people in here who are talking to me like, hmm, I am really sorry. That is the message that you and me want to who guys done, or you're gonna stick with them, you're like, don't fucking do this shit. Are you packed on all my shit? That's gonna fuck me after you. You're strong when you clap with the role of you. And that's why I'm not fucking for 150. To be honest, right here. Right here, to 100. Right here to 100. What does this show up ask? What's the receipt look like? The young co-words, he asked, what are your roses? And I googled that and found the website and the co-bases, means how much we're done. Which one of you's buying your flowers? $300 more than flowers. You might love you. No. And you could try it. Is that what you're saying? No. That would be my note too. If you were not, then they picked on themselves. These flowers. For now, or if you weren't before, if you get these made roses, they can make it look good. I think you're solid deal. What do you fucking steal that? You're best friend you said. By your ex-experience. I love you though. I'm from Briarge. What? You told three hours to see me. Oh my god. This is $900. That's $900. That's $900. That's $900. Oh, sorry. Oh my god. Oh my god. Damn. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. That's great. That's a very good reply. Thank you for being so. Thank you for letting us enjoy your bed. I wish you been absolutely best. And he sounds like somebody in a weird told you. To my neighborhood. We're getting next. Men from Ireland. Which I think you got the dial off. Just say look who you at. That's right. We're in Miami. I'm already talking to somebody. What is it you don't like about me to Miami? They're all trash. They're all trash. You don't go find your husband in here. He only knew everybody. Where do you usually date guys from? Anywhere else? Prison? Oh my god. No, your mom didn't yell at you. No, she knows better than I was. I was about to fuck your mom as we get into this conversation. It's not a lot. What is it about Miami men you find trashful? They're toxic. No, but once an example of toxic, you can't say general things. They like their cars, but they like their women. Are their cars quieter? Yeah. I don't think it's a fair generalization you said toxic. They're not. But once toxic, but all you said was toxic. Why did they make you sick literally? Physically they make you sick. Well, if you guys drink a little less. I think I'm in Miami men with a break of water. I mean, they swam through when you're in the game room. Yeah. Don't tell a shit about Miami men. They're looking like the rest of the kids here. And what you remain here is Michael Phelps. Everybody... They're spat on. What the fuck? See you close to fucking glitch in the matrix right now. Tell me shit about Miami men. I thought my browser incident was about to come off. He's about to take to believe it all. Show's not where everybody goes. Y'all come to my hardest fall. How long you guys been together? Six months? Ah, give it time. That's five-door. What did you guys mean? The club? Yeah, give it time. Who approached you? You approached her? Yeah. You little creep. What you gonna do now? Fun night out with her friends? Fuck outta here. Did he have any kind of club or line with you approached me at the club? You had the club or line? No, what was the line? What was your open way? Okay, this is surprising to me. Maybe not anyone else in Florida? But she didn't want him to talk to her like I said. And so she told him she was 17 and pregnant. He was like this I always wanted to be on MTV. Ah, there. The best guy on the star now. All right. Oh my god. It's not only where you underage in the club. You also told me you were pregnant. As you took a drink out of alcohol, that's the most Miami shit I've ever heard of in my life. But I love it. Clearly you didn't care. I think it was like I can help both y'all with your homework. I'll be waiting until now. Selfies with that time. I'll leave with your best feature, yes. Oh, you're on a daily gas. Hey, that's the red flag. Don't be on daily gas. First place. It's hard out here. It is hard out here. Not for some of us. What is it doing, okay? What is it about, if though? Is it physically unattractive? I think that's it. Be it a liking guy's fish, either you said. No. You don't like guys who survive for their family? Do you have your heart dating profile? What's your what's your apple you go to? I never met anyone. You've never met anyone that dating him? Plus sad. Can I see your profile? I agree with you. Got all these standards. Move up to the seat. Do you want to see? Met Max here, phone? Something we got. Let's see what we got here. Okay, here we go. Photos. All right, first one is in front of the grass wall. Literally the most fuckboy pose. Might as well just be captioned. If you're trying to pay my rent. Next one is just a sexy kind of selfie. And if this is actually a very beautiful photo, you smash. All right. Let's see, the next one is on a life of a girl's ass. When it's three girls, all with their asses to the camera. You don't know who's profile it actually is. This is the, which one are you in this middle left right? The left? The left? The left? The least good at ass. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You have a problem. Maddle of fat bitch your tummy is out in this photo. Are you fucking kidding me? With the peace arm. Oh my god. Take your phone, you little lesbos. Oh my god. Jesus Christ. Hey, hypocrisy. Wow. What was your last relationship? A year ago? We broke up with him. Hey, broke up with you. He was like, later bitch. Now it all makes sense. I'm sorry. He's begging for you back. No, he's not. I'm sorry. This is just like an odd question to people in the back. But are you wearing pants? Not at all? You work next door. What's next door? 11? Are you really not wearing pants at all? Oh, it's beautiful. Can I press the end up? Can you say it up? TAN? No. No, okay. Hold on. Hold on. You have a tattoo on your butt. It's a seahorse. What's the significance of a seahorse on your butt? My eyes are up here. Never gonna be me too. I don't think so. What's the significance of a seahorse on your butt? I'm a mom. But a seahorse is the male. Hey, that didn't make sense. She goes, well, first of all, I'm a mom. As you can tell, I've been come to. She said, I'm a mom. In a seahorse community, I don't know how to educate you. But the male seahorse is actually who gives burrs. She said, that she won't hurt you, man. But that didn't happen. Yeah, she said, unfortunately, it was me. Okay, I'm just watching this game right now. You know, babysitters and with the father. All of the above? Did you fuck the babysitters? You're pregnant too! Oh my god! Are you a seahorse or a trans? You guys missed it, but she's... When she laughed, she did this and it came out. This bitch almost hyped her football, I mean. She's an open-to-boy or girl yet? Boy! Boy and cancer can't gender it yet. Cancer is thought. Are you still with the father? Is this a rare? No. Oh, you're... It's not you, okay? I can see you're out, but you're not tough to trust, guys. Are you with your kids dad still? Question mark? How long with him? Two years. How was your kid? Four. Don't homeschool this kid. Were you seeing him for a little while and you got back together? Is that one of this? You're not together. So you lied to me. Red flag. No, fuck no red flag. A child-protective services? Oh, yes. You don't want to do that. You're from Miami. You know, four-year-old child. Sixteen? And then it's Barbie. That's sitting down before you miscarriage. When you're crazy. You put it in the road jumping fucking chest fucking people. Crazy. So irresponsible. It's got a little bit off the rails. You're starting with red flags and now I'm trying to fuck two bombs. What's that? Pretty useful. What's pretty useful? You getting up for rails. Me getting off the rails. I feel like you hit some rails before you came here. Are you by yourself? Yeah. Really? It's my dad and my mom. That's your dad and your mom. Oh, for now. Okay, you don't really want to actually hear her parents? No, for tonight. No, don't you kid just rent parents? Yeah, it's all the documentary. I said you can't just rent parents. She said it's Miami. You can rent anything. Yeah, I heard this whole island for that. Are you going to be slaughtered now? I am. Are we going to? If we can't do dark jokes, go see somebody else. Let's joke about fucked up things. Otherwise they're just negative. Yeah. This is good. You guys came around. Takes a little bit of a push to get your guys to work and fuck this. That's what we have. Bye bye. All right, mom. Shut up. Yeah. I'm gonna fuck this up. That's what you're gonna say. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. That is a little girl who looks quiet. I mean, you're just sexy. She's got some sexy in here. You guys coupled up? The Sprints? Yeah, but... What's your spin? Grads. Grads. What do you guys graduate from? I am. What are you studying? Music, business. And what are you doing in the music business? I'm a head-and-er-magic man. Oh, you're an American magazine. Which magazine? The Spankers' Name. What is it? Hot living. Hot living. Did you call it something else? Sparks' Name. What's your problem? The Spankers' Name. Hold living. Hold living. Hold living. Yeah. Holds. That's gay, right? That's the gayest way to say that word, isn't it? So hot right now. Listen. I'm so like Eastern European. I'm in here, so hot right now. When you guys came together, which one of y'all sure I'd let the other one be honest? You guys can see him, but he didn't even like that. Yeah. Stay strong, gay. I actually do not mean one of them sleeping on the same bed with me. Oh! Respect. So you got to be like, how you pull? How you pull? That's kind of impressive. It's fucked up, it's impressive. What's the circumstances? I'm a fast-down joke, and I'm out of party. You're a fast-down joke, and I'm going to party. That's kind of on you. She and your best friend had sex in the same bed like, X-T? She asked him why. And he said he was drunk, and she had a nice face. There's got to work. So, the Sunday hundred five now, she woke up with his penis, side-to-earth. She was like, I kind of want her to be that. I don't want her to be that. So she said, the next day, her friends that told her, she woke up with her boyfriend's penis inside her. Was he asleep? I said, it's about three-stroke sleep. Oh! He said it took about three strokes. He was good. I guess the closing was higher too. All right, we're not going to pump shade with anybody. Okay, it happens. To the best of us. Not me, but I don't think we're going to be in the middle. Really? Yeah, we were living together. You were living together? Fuck. I weighed 220 pounds, and now I'm in 140 with a better ass. You weighed 220 pounds. This is the breakup. You've lost 80 pounds, and you have better ass than her. Can't we see you? Ah! Yeah! Okay, that's enough. I don't have the cash. I don't know. How much of your grosses? That's not what we made. It's body right there. That's what it is. Yeah, congratulations. I'm glad you focused on you working on the investment. How long ago is this by the way? Four years ago? 80 pounds is less impressive. I thought it was like three months ago. I was like, damn! But no, that couldn't have been late this month. Not today. I think she and my every guy. I think I'm going to stop. Your ex had a threesome with your two best friends while you were there. Life stopped so bad, isn't it? If you make your life a car, he's got it way worse. He fucked her whole crew. Where did you meet this legend? Asshole. Where did you meet this legend? It was Virginia. Oh my God. I see you guys part of family reunion and what happened? How long have you been here for? Top. A couple months. Oh, that's barely your boyfriend. That's just that guy you and your friends were fun. I think a lot of you guys have been pretty fucked up experiences. Uses are a lot more like hearted uses than people like. I'm not sure we'll live at home. You know y'all, like, nah, I just fucked your whole family. I just fucked everybody you know. Why am I doing this next level time again? You know what, fucked up the cameras, but you know what I mean? Jesus Christ. Okay, does it look like I'm a woman that's not cheating related? Wait, what, you have your hand raised? If you want to school, what is it? Okay, Tennis, you don't have to stand up. You can just sit. It's like a couple. It's good to sit for my peace. Alright, what's your lifeline for a guy? A men's rights activist. A men's rights activist. Oh, bitch, you should not have a surname. Oh, I gotta call my boy Andrew Tate. Oh, what is there? Yeah. So you dated a guy before who's a men's activist? On a day he went to Stephen Colbert. You went on a date, he went to self-steven Colbert. He was on a Stephen Colbert. As a men's rights activist. You fucked Jordan Peterson? You fucked Noah? That's my son, Adam. That's Tender. You went on Tender. But if you don't want to date a person, dated him? You did, did he pay for dinner? He paid for drinks. Did you get dinner? But he paid for the drinks? That's crazy. And is you not liking the night of the day? Okay, so we got to the men's rights activist work. He talked about men's rights during the day. Hey guys, don't do that. That makes posting so much. Don't leave me like that. Or date number one. Don't be like date number one. You're like, hey, you know who gets paid too much? You're like a fashion. I guess not even being on a side of men's activists aside, they're just like, don't even hold them with that. You can't look ever. Okay, so that's poor game on this end. Do you know that men die younger than women? Do I know that men die younger than women? I mean, if this conversation goes on, it will longer on the children of self. What did he say about men's rights that you didn't like? Okay, well, I guess I will do it again. Women, you know, women are older than men. And like, that's a problem. And I'm like, women look older than men because men fuck men over. Like, this is not a... I'm not an attorney, but it feels like you lost this case. She's so sick. Well, I was just getting rid of my kid. The only thing that's amused to play was she said, if he told her, you know, women live longer than men. And she didn't like best to test it because... Next! You didn't tell me how much blame... You just said he lives just to test it. You didn't tell him life's better for women. Oh, he said that life is better for women than that's why they live longer. That's what he said. Because it sounds like I said it because you didn't say it. This women's life is so bad because women live longer. Gotcha. Okay, so you said that life is better for women than men. Oh, he said that life is better for women than that's why they live longer. Yeah, because women live longer. Gotcha. Okay, so all at all, she said that he said women live longer than men because women have an easier life than men. This is gonna be fun. This is gonna be a really good show. Thank you. Men do work more dangerous jobs. That's the real thing. Mormon commits suicide. Mormon are in prison. You're sitting right now? That's the real thing. Oh, my God. Because I know what makes me make only a bad heart. And she's been so for a long time. I love how you mean men don't have the moral line. And then you make it mind miserable. Right? Man, when we go out, I mean, very normal. I'm not a human or something. But when you're very fucking. Can anyone talk? Man, it's a thing. It's not really more like a target, you know? I like Melissa. When your friends find him on a pitch. You met him at a bar. You did it for six months. Your friend was on a pitch. And she saw his profile on him. Now, does she know that they got a previous profile? I mean, he wrote the answer to me. He said it's active today. He said it's active today. Maybe he was going on there to be like, man, all these girls are gonna be on the pitch. Yeah. Yeah. You don't know what he was? You don't know what he was? You don't know what he was? You don't know what he was? You don't know what he was? You're gonna be like, man, I'm gonna go blind. You're gonna follow me, man. You just straight break up with him over that? No. No, you're gonna go blind. No, you're gonna go blind. I know there was a deep relationship. I'm not sure I had any of the relationships. Obviously, he did this one shady thing that you're unsure about. But it happens in relationships all the time. It makes understandings. I don't know if I'm true, so I got to just get him passed. What was the funniest story? Dis-honest. Dis-honest. About being one hit. What was the funniest story? Where's your dream scenario to meet a guy? You're like, your life is a very slow thing. I really like to meet a guy. At the end of the program. I love the face. You look mad just statistically. We don't live that long. Really trying to help. Less sense. You know what I mean? Hold on a second. Yes, do you go here? I would do something this side. No big no-bakes from the side. Calls is mom more than you. Calls is mom more than you. More than you. Well, yeah. It's his mom. He can't love his mom. Oh, stop touching this dude. Is this your boyfriend? Okay. Hey, man, I want you to scoot over. She's next to a dude who looks like he'll kill you. I can't be idle. Who are you here with? There's a bathroom. Yeah, bad. Who's this gentleman with you? Who's this gentleman with you? A potato. He's my driver. Her driver. Who are you? Is she a Batman? I'm your driver. You're a smart girl. This sounds like you're around the hall. A smart girl would go, I've had enough tonight. I can drive home safely now. But then you're like, I want to not remember. You take care of me. What does happen? I've yet to meet before. Is this purely like a just met for professionally in a seating room? Oh, my God. On this episode of WinFunk, your Uber driver goes wrong. Hey, is this Dick V. Stars though? Wait a minute. That's too many. Is your Uber pulled out? Oh, my God. So you caught your booty going to drive? I'm loving this time here right now. This is the most Miami shit I've got across the world. This is what I'm getting. Sit down, bitch, you drunk. You can't drive. Where you going? You're the highest. Oh, there's the friends. Holy shit. Y'all have missed a story. Did you know your friend drives for fake taxi? He's your old driver, too. Don't run. Don't run. Oh, no. No! I hate this thing. Yeah. Dollar-wing book, she's dog. This is the drunkest person. Oh, my God. Sorry. Do you want me to talk to you? I'm going to talk to you in the whole show. Talk to you right on the show. Does anybody understand tequila? Does anybody? Where is your boyfriend? Is that home? Living is the best life. He's at home right now, like. Is it just me or is it not annoying expecting him? Don't know. Huh? Huh? I hate Miami. You have me fantastic. All the one of you were so much fun. Yeah. Yeah, it's how I hold. Yeah, I love you, but you're great. Those are new beliefs. You could have been saying the same thing. I have a great line today. Yeah, I love you. You're great. You were super sweet, too. Y'all city is fucking wild. I hope you do. Ladies. I went to 11 twice. I went to 11 twice. I went to 11 twice. Bro, what the? What is this next hour? They're open to 10 a.m. Stop cheering. This isn't promo. Is that a problem? Like, y'all are nuts. You guys are so toxic that I'm like, Here's your city's problems. Y'all are ruined. You guys are so funny. So funny. What's it all? Oh my god. Yeah. You guys cheer, but I had to give my ass to get this. I love it. It's a different beast. Oh my god. I love you. I got something to put it on your head. What did you say? I don't know. I don't know any promo. Is that your boyfriend? He's so confusing. Usually, crowd work for a show. I imagine most of you came from fucking TikTok. So I imagine. So you used to have TikTok. How do you see crowd work? Oh, it's your life. I'm so excited. So you used to have TikTok. How do you see crowd work? Oh, it's your life. Bands are banter. Bands are a funnier response. Bands are banter. You guys are like, nah, f**k all that. You want to talk to us? Sight. Oh, good night, you're an old man, Jenna. Where's your voice? Oh, good night, Jenna. Oh, good night, Jenna. Oh, you watch the overnight channel? Yeah, I saw. You believe in ghosts? Yeah, it's not the funny show, you know. What? I said the ghost show. And then you went, see. And then I said, do you believe in ghosts? And then you went. No, no. Open, I swear. I've never hated a certain square footage. And it's like, I was thinking more like duct tape. Man, next to those girls, yes, the one dressed like hamburger. Did you? I'm sorry, it was the first thing that gave him a mind. I'm so sorry. Can you please stand up so that he can have soul? It's so spying on. I love you so much. I was watching for the entire show and like, your reaction is what I was like laughing at me and then with this. So it would be like, it would feel like a combination of like, uh. So thank you for coming to the show even though I didn't have to say Beetlejuice three times. You're so smooth. I mentioned it, I'm also as nice as 9.5. You have any shoes in the back of a full locker. You got to come to the can. You got to come to the can? You from Kansas? Oh, that's why you're so wholesome. Not a feature of O inside. Oh, she said Tampa? Oh, yeah, fuck Kansas. I was being so nice. I was like, oh yeah, Kansas, don't do that. Fuck, that's thing. Even by the nature, it's like tornado every year. That's just like, here's the thing. We have to get out of here in a second because I'm going to team little 11. I am kidding. Are you going to go flush your mind? You've got broken 12 women on third time. That's great. What is it? Third time's the charm. Yeah, I would like to not get climbing it. We'll be awesome. We'd love to get out here in a moment. But if anybody wants to shake hands and take pictures after the show, we'd love to come say so. Love to meet you guys. I think we should do it like here on stage. So with, uh, fuck, I'm sorry. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry. I know, that was gonna be, but like, she was awful. Look, can't wait to meet you guys. Um, very fun. Uh, we'll be like, I'm not Chris Rock. There's these things to ask because I'm ready to. Bro, can I kiss out one hand? Am I Spider-Man? Yes. See, I don't even have to go to 11 to kiss off of it. Am I great? Oh my god. Is this from you? So sweet. Thank you. Can I read it? Okay, let's see. Uh, dear Mr. Bieber is scratched out right now. Uh, right. Uh, first, um, firstly, my condolences for the loss of your grandpa. Thank you. Uh, your fans have felt his warmth through your jokes and the stories you were writing to me. Very sweet. Uh, secondly, happy anniversary of the release of Only Fans. Is it today? It was yesterday. My first, my first birthday, my last year, I didn't even realize that. Thank you so much. You're so sweet. Uh, third, what that dig do. That's not what I was talking about. It's not an awkward loss. I want you to have something to connect to your grandpa. Memorialize your achievements and show, uh, show your hometown how far you've come. And the John Deere tractor is in the mail. I'm from the middle of nowhere, Ohio. So I don't think I've read Northland. The, uh, the club, uh, the club's dumpster didn't have the making for a Wee-Tee 4. Right, reference. Uh, I couldn't build you a bear and security confiscated the pocket pussy. What's wrong with yours? This won't live up to your, uh, potato salad. But please enjoy. Good luck with your next special and happy holidays. Gronley, thank you. Thank you. Oh. Oh. P.S., this bitch in front of me won't shut the fuck up. How'd you know? Can I open it? What is it? If it's an anvil rags, it's not okay. Oh, it's taped off that fuck here. I haven't got damn. You have nails? Did you have them this morning? Thank you. They're delicious. Taked on. What's in it? Yeah, it's all going to start to be else. Yeah. Stop judging. You're judging. So sweet. Thank you so much for that. I don't know what it is yet, but thank you for at least the kind of words you're hearing. That's really fun. Oh, here we go. You deserve that. This one. Fuck, it's worth the paper. I'm sorry. Okay, here we go. Then why are you in a room with the... ...fake and torn? It's so muchable. It's so muchable. Fuck. I'm not having a fuck guess. You're right. You're right. Gently yours so sweet. Thank you so much. Change, everybody. I mean, having wonderful week. Thanks so much. I'm pretty nervous. Change, everyone. I'm gonna say that. Keep it going for me around.
I love swearing, I've always quite, you aren't sorry what was that? I missed a bit of chat. Hi. It's not the telly if you talk I can hear. Now you're looking pissed off, you're thinking I didn't press the red button, it's gone all interactive. What were you saying? Go on, say. You thought you... You just said I thought you were talking about Snake Bite the drink. Yeah, what happened was... Okay, in a joke, a joke is like two stories, yeah? And the first story makes you make an assumption about something. So the assumption people made about Snake Bite in that joke was that it was a snake biting you. That's the setup of the joke. So you may be a assumption you're talking about a snake bite, a snake biting someone. In the second part of the joke, often known as the punchline, what you'll find is that rug will be whipped from under you and you'll realise the assumption you made was erroneous. Suddenly revealing a fact that was previously concealed is the nature of all one-liders, batom. So in essence, I was talking about both the snake bites, the thing that happens when a snake bites you, and also the drink. No problem at all, it's lovely to help. Actually, it's nice to have you here this evening because I think one of the charity gigs I did help pay for the minibus that brought you here. Nice to see that money wasn't wasted. Oh, bless a little half. Why are you making of the rest of the show? Are you just enjoying the spangly things? I tell you what's embarrassing, getting your cock stuck in the flies of another man's trousers. Could you move around a bit? I think you're encouraging the others. What's your name, man? Am I better ask? Gemma, hello Gemma. Is there any chance you could just pop the Chinese love balls out for a minute? You seem to be teetering on the edge of orgasm at all times. I've seen it in films, I know. What do you do Gemma? I don't have a cheerleading coach. You're a cheerleading coach. The easiest job in the world. I think if I'm not mistaken there's a new name for cheerleading coach though, isn't there? Don't we call it grooming now? So who do they cheerlead for? Um, well, have a squad call the fury gem? You have a squad call the what? The fury gem. The fury gem? Is that a term for menstruation? Sorry. There's a cheerleading squad called the fury gem. You're right, love now, I've got the fury gem. And you teach people to cheerlead? Yes, like stunting, like don't love me. These are grown adults. No, I've got, um, 20, 80s, 10 to 16. 10 to 16? Yeah. And you get them to... Well, it's not that I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. And you get them to... Well, it's not just a compound and sharing a bottle. I'm pretty sure it is. I'm no expert. I know there's a lot of sharing. There's more sharing than you would imagine. Has anyone else got any cheerleading DVDs? I'm something of a connoisseur. I have a collection. And mainly they like to get sudsie. Let's move this along. But lovely to meet you with your hilarious laugh. It's infectious. I like it. Thanks very much for coming. Thanks. And thanks very much for cheerlead. And thank you for helping our young people go. It's valuable work you do. I like it when ladies get tattoos. Have any ladies in here got tattoos? What have you got? A vent. A what? A vent. A vent. I think that may be the crudest term I've ever heard for a vagina. I've got a vent. Well, if you're particularly gassy, I suppose. Whereabouts is this vent? On your arm. On your arm. You've got a vent. You have, by all accounts, got some sort of vent. Fucking go-girl. Nothing says feminine like air conditioning equipment. Nothing says I'm hot like I need a fucking vent. That's how hot I fucking am. Does anyone got one on the small of their back? What have you got? Football symbol. A football symbol. What, sorry? Yes, I was. Oh, look. A football symbol. What is it? Gaelic football. It's Gaelic football. Yes. I wish football. Right, no, I know what Gaelic football is. How come you've got that there? Did you do the whole team and you've got a bonus? Is that, I don't know. It's just, it's always struck me. It's a lovely place to get a tattoo because it's discreet. When you ask a lot of ladies why they get a tattoo, they say, I've got one there because it's just for me and my partner. Or partners. But my question is, if he's looking at that, he's already having a good time. The last thing he needs is more visual stimulus. What you've basically got on your lower back is a target. Having said that, I really liked tattoos there, so I'm trying to convince my girlfriend to get one. I wanted to either get, if you can read this, you're fucking me. Or now wash your hands. I'd like to get a tattoo. I'm thinking about getting one just there, just across there. Just above the speedo, just above the banana hammock. Saying caution choking hazard. Age is 16 and up. Make and tame nuts. Are you all drinking this evening, ladies and gentlemen? Are you drinking? Quite a few. I like drinking. I prefer being drunk than getting drunk. I'm not very keen on beer and wine, but I like the interesting things you order when you're drunk. The drinks that no one ever order sober. Aftershock is a prime example. You know that weird pink fluid. No one's ever ordered that. So the designated driver has never walked into a bar. I'm thought, well, I can have one drink, can't I? They've got beer, they've got wine, they've got spirits. No. I'll have a pipette of aftershock, please. The same with the flaming zambuka, no one's ever ordered one of those sober. You have. You've ordered a flaming zambuka sober. It's your drink. You order flaming zambokas. The clue as to what you shouldn't order one, madam. He's the fact it's on fire. It's the equivalent of walking into a kitchen going on a bit first, eh? As a glass and a tap. And then spying out the corner of your eye, a gas hob. The only reason I could possibly think of to order a flaming zambuka when sober is if you meet a girl and she's something just a little bit special. Yeah. Maybe you've been out on tour three days. You've established she's beautiful, she's intelligent, she's funny. You think you might be in love with her. She might be the one, but she's got a bit of a problem with facial hair on the top lip. That can be an awkward thing to bring up. Much better, I think. Take her out for a drink. Two flaming zambokas, please. No, no, no, they're both for you. You know, are you drinking flaming zambokas as well? Whereabouts in front? Oh, of course, sorry, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry, I was just asking kind of a London audience to you drink flaming zambokas when sober. If I'd thought there were people in from Newcastle, I would have said what do you like to drink to get you in the mood for a fight? So what you down here on the marble, what are you up to? So we sent you an email saying if you wanted to go out for drinks in Newcastle, we'd show you the best sites. The best sites in Newcastle? I imagine the one where you go. Size isn't important, it's what you do with it. Would you agree with that, ladies? No, no, no. There's a lady over there that likes a big cock and she doesn't care who knows it. Sorry, it's quite possible you just whispered that and they picked up an echo. I've just always thought that such a f***ing-hearted expression. Size isn't important, it's what you do with it. Well, I was planning to pop it in your mouth and you've a giant of how's that? Is that going to be a total waste of time? I'm not my own mum thought I was gay. When I was 19, my mum was convinced I was gay. It's very difficult to convince your mum you're not gay. So we got a camp called where I was fucked. But I'm what's referred to as a gay-friendly act. You know? I'm a gay-friendly act. I was asked last November to judge Mr. Gay UK. I said it would be my pleasure, he's against nature and against God and he's going to hell. I think it's okay to tell that, Joe, because it's almost impossible to offend a homosexual man. You know, because let's face it, they're doing that for fun. If your idea of a good time is a cock and you're asked, what do you care? We've all thought about gay-sex, haven't we? You've thought about gay-sex, haven't you, sir? No. You haven't thought about gay-sex. You haven't thought about gay-sex. You just let him there and fucked him. Well, I'm, I honestly, sir, you're bravery. I thought about gay-sex, I thought, oh, my cock will get covered in poo. You're sniggering. What's your name? Long Vady, who? Move along. What are you saying, Vicky? Dance for me monkey boy. Is he your fella? What do you mean? Is either your fella or he isn't? Is he, is he your fella? Yeah. Sorry, she's saying yes. And you're saying no and you're just look, you've gone really red and you look really embarrassed. They're fuck buddies. Oh! I see what, how very molten. How very 2005, so you're not going out with each other but you are fuck buddies. That is fantastic. Can we just all take a moment to congratulate that man there? He's a lot of work has gone into that. A lot of work has gone into that. He's had to buy a cosmopolitan for a couple of years. Sorry? And they'll know that you were dead with a little hussey. The great thing about that is that he's convinced you that yeah, we don't need a relationship. It's so, it's so old fashioned. I should be able to sleep with whoever I want to sleep with. And so should you as long as it's just me when I say. Yeah, there'll be a lot of jokes. It's not every day I get to talk to a slag. Come on. Now... I don't know where the mark is until I overstepped it. That's mine. You just did. That is juvenile. That, sorry, for those of you that didn't see that, it'll be on the DVD. Available at all good car boots. Vicki's response to that. Yeah, she's been called a slag at a show. That's not good in anyone's book and I apologise for that unreservedly. But did you really need to do that? God bless you. Let's do some improv, ladies and gentlemen. All I need is suggestions from you. Right, I need a historical figure. Nelson. Oliver Crocknotti. Yeah, very much a mixed ability group this evening. Oliver Cromwell, Noddy. Mother Teresa. God bless her. Mother Teresa, amazing woman. Wasn't she very generous with her time? And all the hope you do look at her and think, yeah, a little bit of moisturiser wouldn't have fucking killed you. So I'm all for helping the poor, but just oil of Ula, take the edge off that. Fuck me, it's like a saddlebag. She looks like my balls. I'm joking, my balls are in significantly better care than Mother Teresa's face. I friend of mine quite recently, a couple of months ago, got proper old school flashed. Guy in a Mac at Darsk in a park, one of those. Sorry, I've added that. I don't... I don't know if you did that. You would though, wouldn't you give it a bit of cockslapp? You probably treat it to the windmill, wouldn't you? Who you own? Anyway, she got proper old school flashed and she shouted, rape. I thought, don't give it my ideas. Don't workshop with your fucking lunatic. Has anyone in here been flashed? Go on, what happened, Madam Teresa? Funny story or is it distressing? In a club. In a club and someone flashed you in the club. Are you sure you didn't go off with a man in a club? I was kissing him, I don't... I ended his hip and then he flashed me. Go on, what happened? Tell me the story. Middle of the dance floor and he was throwing some shapes. And one of his was... So to get rid of the guy, your friend told him you were lesbians. That's how these two started, but then... They liked it, so they stuck with it. Did that work? She said we don't like cock. So someone flat, someone got his cock at in the middle of the dance floor in a club. And you went, oh no, sorry, we're lesbians. You could've just told him to fuck off, you're incredibly polite. I'll make up an excuse so he doesn't feel bad. I don't want the flash to feel rejected. How nice are you? Any other ultimate sexual fancies? A Viking helmet. A Viking helmet? What have you got to vaginas? I don't know if anyone's got this. There are lots of couples in this evening. How many couples do we have? By show of hands. How many do we have by shouting out? Hundreds, brilliant. Does anyone have this arrangement in their relationship? It's becoming ever more common now for couples to have an arrangement whereby they're totally faithful to each other. But they've got to clause whereby if one of them was to meet a certain celebrity, they would be allowed to stray. Has anyone got that going on in their relationship? Who have you gone? You. I noticed that you're sitting next to a lady. You're going to do what when you go home? She's going to kill you? Right. Or strapped on the fuck you certainly. You want all the other? Anyone else got one? You've got one. Who have you got? Jim Carey. All right. He might be up for it. I do his boyfriend got? Anything I'm not bothers? What? Sorry? Anything good looking? What bit of a change? Yeah, lovely. Only about British men's ultimate sexual fantasy. And it surprised me, the result of it surprised me. It was a proper server. They asked 3000 men their opinion. I'd like to do a little straw poll in here this evening because the result of this, I was shocked. Ultimate sexual fantasy is anyone got one they wouldn't mind admitting to. Jessica Arba. Jessica Arba, it's a specific person that you would like to bone. Well, I happen to know Jessica Arba does an awful lot of work for charity. And any other ultimate sexual fantasy? No, I'm right. My girlfriend. Well, maybe we're good double teamer. My girlfriend is your ultimate sexual fantasy. Yes, people see my girlfriend and they see me and they say she's only going out with you because you're famous. And I say, I am famous. What's your point? Is that your girlfriend? That's your girlfriend? I'm not going to swap if that's OK. Can I just clarify, you are a beautiful lady, no disrespect to you. Where he heckled, I had to put him down. And the only way to get to him was through you. I like the way as well. I suggest your girlfriend wasn't good looking up and you applauded. Yeah, you'll be using those hands later on when you. I tell you why there's no women's boxing the way in. The fight would happen then and there. Have you all seen the new male Gibson film? The Passion of the Christ. It's upset and awful lot of Christians. They're up in arms about it. He's made a film about the life of Christ. But he's tacked on this silly Hollywood ending where the hero comes back at the end. Does she love the little baby Jesus? Does she love the little baby Jesus or not? Is it a wee or a pooh? Should we time her? So, is a bit embarrassing, isn't it? You know that disclaimer they put at the end of films. You know the one that says the characters in the events in this film are purely fictitious. Any alleged of real characters in events is purely coincidental. Do they really need that on Lord of the Rings? Is anyone watching that thinking this is a brilliant documentary? I might think about going to New Zealand on my holidays. But wait, no, I don't want it ruined by Sarah Mann, he's all calming. Your hair. What, I'm just saying. I like a spy skills as much as the next man. It's a nose. I can't help noticing that you've got a tattoo on your... What's your boob, isn't it? Really? It sort of draws the eye. What is that, exactly? It's a rose. As if boobs aren't fun enough as they are. She's thought, I'll brighten these things up. No fellers going to like these. What are guys like? They're like flowers, don't they? Yeah, I'll get a picture of a flower. Did you not think what do you like? What kind of thing? You look like sort of bloated like cars and guns and tanks. Get a nice tattoo of a tank on your tip. Lovely. He could be, you know, and going all, is that a Sherman? Because flower is, unless he's secretly gay, and I'll be honest, there's a lot of earrings and spiky hair. Good, fine. Did you think that she got bladder problems? Maybe some sort of yeast infection, I'm not. We'll ask her when she comes back. I just hope she hasn't got any vaginal defects. It's a lovely word, though, isn't it, vaginal? Oh, clearly not. Right, let's try some root stuff, see what we get along. Lady Wind. Quee thing. Fanny Farts. The expulsion of air from the Vajay J during sexual intercourse. A f***ing grunt. There are two main responses when a queefe occurs. Some couples, it doesn't matter how gnarly or squalchy the noise. They deny the queefe. Do you do anything? No, I didn't hear anything. And they move on. Some couples, it's a funny little noise, they have a little giggle, they move on. Not a problem. I like to go a third way. I like to pretend the vagina is talking to me. What's that? There's a boy trapped down a well. I like to think of myself as the vagina whisperer. What happened? Do you get in the phone call? Is it a scotch lady getting a phone call? I imagine the drugs are arriving any moment. All right. You switched it off and it rang anyway. Well, I'm not buying that f***ing story. Don't worry, it's okay. It's only a phone. Don't feel bad. It's a late alarm to come and see me. Or come and see me in our f***ing late. You're not the one I booked for the intervalier. Do you not the most common crime is in Wales? No. Hang on, I've got to ask someone about her fufu. It's a long time for a pee, you're all right. You're fine. You're sure? Is that better? Bless you. Sorry, I'm just talking to your friend about being from Wales. Do you know the most common crime is in Wales? Have a guess. Well, guess. Cheap shagging. Well, that's rather insulting, isn't it? And to add insult to injury, you're wrong. It's not cheap shagging. It's actually ram-raiding. LAUGHTER The second most common crime is having sex with a minor. If anyone's offended, just look for the other meaning. You'll be fine. A very common male fan has to have two women at the same time. Want to cook, want to clean? Easy there, I'm joking. They want to f*** them. My girlfriend wants a diamond ring. And the only reason I know that is, it's pretty much all she f***ing talks about. Let's face facts. Anywhere my girlfriend's getting a diamond ring is if the vajazzler slips. I don't really understand the vajazzle. I mean, I know what a vajazzle is. I know what it is. They whip away all the hair from your fufu and then they de-montae it. I say, there, I imagine you get some pretty sick and glitter and have a crack yourself. Have a sparkly crack yourself. You're welcome. I just don't know who that's for. I've never met a man who said to me, ah, I love the gyners. But I wish they'd been more juggie. If you more sparkles wouldn't go, I miss. I want a glamour plus. A showbiz entrance. Has anyone had a vajazzle? She had, what motif did you go for, Madam? You had a heart because you were embarrassed to ask for... You were embarrassed to ask for something spectacular. You were all in with someone putting glitter on your family, but you were... I don't know how to ask for anything embarrassing. How adorable. And was it for a special occasion or was it just... No, I just thought, why not? You thought, why not? Or, apparently, a fucking reason's basic hygiene. Your boyfriend could chip a tooth. And it was definitely a problem of the jazzle, not a Liverpool vajazzle, which is just a euphemism for herpes. I didn't always use to do this for a living. I used to work for an oil company. It was the same sort of thing, it's telling lies to strangers. That was a bit more awkward. That was much more... Yeah, don't worry about Nigeria. That'll be fine. When I did used to work for a living, I was always very jealous of the women that I worked with because women have the best excuse for a day off sick. I love a day off sick. Marvelous. Do they very nice and come think? And women have the best excuse. The best excuse as we all know is women's problems. And the reason women's problems is the best excuse is because women's problems is the end of a conversation. Why didn't you come in yesterday? Women's problems. I like to think if I was the boss, things would be slightly different. Women's problems? Tits all funny. Which is it, maybe I could have a look. What's your name, Madam? What's your name? Any? It's not the telly. I can see you. What's your name? Camilla. Camilla, what do you do, Camilla? It depends on the guy. I'm only messing about... ...just you look all dressed up for this sort of show. This kind of filth. Maybe he told you we're going to go and see a theatre show in the West End of London, you want fucking brilliant. You probably didn't even say fucking. You probably won't. Marvelous. The West End of London, a theatre show. This will be a bit of class, say he's finally... ...and then you... this and you're going for a fucksack. You thought they're taking a, how do you two know each other? That's your mum. Well, you don't even look like... You look as if you could be sisters. You don't look young, she looks fucking old. You're going to stop going. You're going to stop going. I can't help myself with some sort of... I love the fact you've just turned around to go, Gershie. I've got a question for the ladies. All women I know have got a very clear line. On one side of the line, things they're happy, confident, comfortable and enjoy doing sexually... ...with a loving partner on the other side of the line. Things they've been asked to do that they've said, no. What I would like to know, ladies, is what have you been asked to do that you've said, no. I don't mean like reverse park or wash-up. Where do you draw the line? Is really my mask. And what have you been asked to do that you said, no. You look confused. Did you not realise you could turn shit down? You're just hearing how. You draw the line at Ainal. What, sorry? Yeah, totally. But, but on his birthday, yeah? Man up, lady. That's where you draw the line. Okay, any advance on that, any other weirder things? A threesome. What kind of threesome was it, madam? Was it two guys and you or a prop one? Got one, what kind of threesome was it? Two women? I think, see, I think that. On the surface, that sounds misogynistic, doesn't it? It's out of his gun. I need two women to satisfy me because I'm such a man. I don't think that's what it's about. I think he was thinking of you. He was thinking, wouldn't it be lovely if after love-making, she had someone to talk to? Thinking of you? I'm obviously not. I'm going to take a photo of you, lady, for the last time to forget you. You know, it's a big deal for me, recording a DVD. I thought I'd take a little photo. Yeah, go on, wants. She likes you watching her pee. So, sorry. That is a question I get asked that every show. It's weird that you would ask that. So, because she likes a lot of people to watch her pee. Is that your thing? You like people to watch you pee? Well, clearly, yes. He didn't say that for no reason, did he? Do you remember earlier when you said he was a pido for making you dress up as a schoolgirl? I think it might be payback time. But surely you could just dress her as a schoolgirl and have a deal with her, right? That's fine. That plays into your whole pido fantasy. Everyone's happy. Apart from anyone with any sort of sense of taste and decency. We're frankly horrified by you, too. What's your name, sir? Sam, I said, what, sorry? Southwell. Yeah, definitely, I need a surname for this. I'm not in charge of the register. Don't worry about that. So, what is it about being watched pee that you enjoy? Well, just tell us. We're all interested in it. What do you do? So, what is it like? We're in class of war. We'll find out. I was just saying, if you live with someone, you should be uncomfortable enough and it's anything relevant. Yeah! I'm all for that matter, yes. Once you've been with someone, there's a level of intimacy that suggests that you would be able to pee in front of them or maybe shoot them in their chest. But some people aren't like us, baby. Some people don't think in the way. They're closed, mind it. They've got a sense of, I don't know, appropriate occasion. It's alright, we're not taping this, but oh no, we are. Lovely golden showers. Interesting little fact for you, obsessive Star Trek fans are known as... Virgins. Sorry. Are you a big Star Trek fan? How old are you? Do you mind me asking? You seem like... What, sorry? Twenty. Right. So definitely not a virgin in Glasgow. What, what do you do for a living? You're a secretary. Nice. Is it 1950 already? What? Alright, you seem a bit chippy. Oh, it is Glasgow, sorry. I'd love to chat more, but I'm at work. Yeah, this will cheer you up. Oh, and you've gone for that, nice. What a lady. There's something I don't understand about a woman's jeep spot. I can't quite put my finger on it. I can drive a woman... Well done. That's it, home there, has it? Touched a nerve, so to speak. No, very apt. I can drive a woman wild with my tongue. Would you like me to demonstrate? Pay attention to all the actions happening here, young man. Drive a woman wild with your tongue. Have you palm-weight? Eight-and-all sex is overrated, it's fucking shit. Can't help it's like buggery. I tried it with my girlfriend, she was bored to tears. Is everyone that's going to get it? Let's move along. We've been together now for 12 years, me and my girlfriend. So to keep things fresh in the bedroom, we do a little bit of role play. She pretends to be a nurse, and I pretend I'm still attracted to her. That's divided the room, is it? There's people that thought that was funny, and then there are unattractive women. Some girls like to have the lights off for sex to happen. They're like, all the lights to be out before they have sex. And they've got a name. They're called fuckily mantas. I've never had a complaint about that joke. I've never had a woman come up to me after the show. Excuse me, I'm a fuckily mantar. How do you think I feel? Hungry? I think the next thing for me career-wise, ladies and gentlemen, when we're doing some sort of interview show where I talk to people, you know, this kind of set up. Couple of chairs, you face off against each other. Parkinson, Jonathan Ross Graham, those kind of shows. That'd be great to get, but you can't just start doing that on TV, like day one, that'd be tricky. So what I thought we'd do on this tour is practice. Get someone out of the audience every night with an interesting job or a claim to fame, an interview them, and get a bit of practice with the interviewing. So to that end, does anyone have an interesting job or a claim to fame? Oh, go at your hands, go on straight up. What do you do? You were on TV in Poland. I will take that to mean you work in the adult film business. So you've been on Polish TV, okay, well that is a claim to fame well done, you? And, and Polish radio? Well, finally. That's fucking sealed the deal. Blumkey. What's up, what's up, Blumkey? I think, if I'm not mistaken, she just said, it's when you give a gun a blowjob while he's having a shit. I mean, I'm sorry Madam, a guy asked you to do that. You know what though? I admire that guy. Because that's what made this country great. That's what made civilization great. Daring to dream. There's an optimistic man. Oh, I'm having a shit. I've had loads of shit. It's pretty boring. What about this whole area's free? It's all going on back here. Ah, at what point in the relationship did he ask for that? The ins. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Not a bad way to end a relationship. Things aren't going well, you're not getting on. I'll see if she'll suck me off while I'm having a shit. Because if she says yes, I think she loves you. Does anyone have any questions this evening? Anything you'd like to know? Yes. If you, if I wasn't a comedian, if I couldn't be a comedian, many people would say I can't be. There is a school of thought that says, what the fuck is he doing? But, going, if I couldn't be a comedian, at the same as you, I would dress up as Amalie. And wonder the streets looking for adventure. It's a good look. I'm loving that. But what do you do? You were a student. Where are you studying in London? Canterbury. Oh, never mind. Maybe if you'd worked a little bit harder for your A-levels. Canterbury, you say Canterbury, but why here is clearing? Yeah, there's no shame in that. That's fine. Any other thoughts? Oh, gone. You've got one. What's the best thing? The time we fucked. Any other interesting jumps? What's your name? Caroline. Caroline, what do you do, Caroline? You work in TV. What do you do in TV? You work in Watery? You work on Holby City. Well done, I love it. I love what you've done with Holby City. I think the fucking genius move with Holby City recently was casting Hugh Laurie and changing the location to America. I've done you. Any other claims to fame in the room and any other exciting? You're a what? You're a paleontologist in Birmingham. In case any dinosaurs, is dinosaur bones, yes? Yes. And you look at those. Not just dinosaurs. What have you got another part time job in Asda? What else do you look at? Different fossils. Wow. I'm sure that's a brilliant, wonderful scientific thing to do. But I did a project on dinosaurs when I was six and I loved it. I was very excited and I did lots of pictures and I stuck them in and I did a whole project on dinosaurs and I loved them. And then what I did, and this is an interesting note to you, I grew up. I do. I'm still doing my dinosaur book. I like it. What's it? I'll indulge you. What's your favourite dinosaur? A Velociraptor. Because of Jurassic Park. Oh, you might as well have said Barney. Oh, up. Be the thing if I was going to. Or right. Or right. The other phrase that seems to come up a lot in Birmingham is, it's fucking shit here. Or right. It's fucking shit here. Any other phrases for Birmingham or another? What was that? That was just all vowels. What was it? A Yawal, right? A Yawal. Have you had a stroke? I said I shouldn't really joke about strokes if I ever stroke. I'll be laughing out on the other side of me face. I've got a question for you ladies and gentlemen. Does anyone in this room believe in the supernatural? Ghosts and spirits and the like? Quite a lot of you. It's actually easy to tell if your house is haunted. It isn't. Grow up. It's actually being cynical. But that's this job being a stand-up comedian and I think makes you a bit of a cynic. Has anyone in here actually seen a ghost? Well come on, what did you see, man? Tell us the story. There was no one there. Cool, what did you see? I'm not, I make you nervous. You've seen the undead. And I make you nervous. Doesn't really show me in a good light. I said, come on. Where were you when you saw the apparition? You were in a friend's house. Right. Her stepfather was want to. I think I may have cracked this case already. There's a stepfather involved. Was there ectoplasm? What happened? Were you upstairs? You read his son's bedroom. Of course you were, love. Go on. He had died. You should have mentioned that sooner. And then you started seeing weird shit. I'm loving this. There's a special name for people that have seen ghosts. I'm just a friend of it. All the best with your future. Quite an in-depth story. I'll leave it at that stepfather did something terrible. I used recoded that memory. Hi, I'm Jimmy Carr. The guy you just saw in that video. Thanks for watching it. Because somehow I get money from that. I don't know how. Probably it filters through some sort of advert that you watched before you watched the video. Anyway, thanks for watching it. And somehow that benefits me. And hopefully I'll see you at a live show at some point further down the sunny road. Good luck.
Start making some noise right now for the one and only. Right in the morning, everybody! Oh, we got the squad together. Fucking Jews are in the building! I'm already having sort of a weird day because I had to put my girls cat down today. I didn't have to, she was just out of town so I saw an opportunity. Fun cat jokes, I get to start it. Is it a cat crowd? Are we not a cat crowd? Well, there's a lot of articles, they're like, then you stop testing makeup on animals and the malleys kind of like who gives a shit, right? But I didn't know they were torturing the ant. I thought they were just putting the mascara on the cats. I'm betraying a cat in a makeup chair. You know how much mascara till this cat looks like a whore? We made whiskers look fuckable. Is that not a system? I'm betraying a scientist, he's putting the mascara, gets a boner, he goes, that's an amount right there, that's the recipe. Send that off to L'Oreal. I would love to wear makeup. I wore makeup one time when my girl was all like, oh you can't do black face, it's racist. I'm not gonna be a white bill cosby for Halloween. I dress up like Bill every year. I'm not gonna stop now just because he's innocent. All of the good opinions start right now. I know, right? I know you can't just say, you know, China, but anymore, right? Is China person? I know, I know the thing. Why are you not supposed to say woman, it's little man? I know, I'm on. They tell you, you know, they tell you the thing is girls are great men are bad, but they go trans, great again, it's simple. Yeah. So I have a friend, this girl from right now is actually transitioning from a girl to a fatter girl. That's too sensitive topics. Trans fat joke. Wait, it's not so little more sensitive in North America though, right? It's kind of like, you know what? Don't ask a girl or way. Like, I took a plane in Ecuador. They way you before you get on the plane. Like, you're a piece of luggage. They're asking girls, they're like, how much you weigh girls? Like, I don't know, 130 in the guy's like, 145! Girls are like, I don't want to go to Ecuador anymore. I mean, like, if dudes before you get on the plane, they're like, all right, boys, dick sizes, on the table. But a ruler in a jeweler's loop. 12 and a half, someone just got upgraded. And the trans stuff, you know, you got to talk about the trans stuff that's the only way to get pressed, but... It's the system. It's the new system. We gotta tell you how to do it. Jews used to run the media. Not anymore. They caught, caught, slip and Jews. I don't know, there's a lot of articles. They're like, you know, if you have sex with a trans person, there's still a penis, you suck the dick. There's nothing gay about that. And you're like, I don't maybe, you know? Or maybe it'll be one of those things in 20 years where like, yeah, we were off on that. Yeah, I got carried it. Remember all those dicks that you suck? And we promised you how straight it was? Psych! You're there with coming your mouth? Like, but you promised! You're telling me this is gay now? What the? That's a bullshit! I guess a lot of people are sort of getting in trouble since, you know, everyone became the volunteer HR department of the internet. You can really only get people fired from their like cool Hollywood jobs. You're not going to get fired from his like construction worker job in Staten Island with a tweet. Well, you come to the foreman, you're like, we did some research and turns out Cody tweeted something racist to 2001. And the foreman's just like, yeah, we're all racist. If you could get off this construction site, you homo. We're kind of in the process of scamming a homeowner, so... That's my homeless guys can do whatever the fuck they want! They're jacking off and put you gonna report them to the bureau? I would the guys are jacking off, calling girls, cons. I would love if afterward they took off their fake homeless beard and costume, goes back to his job as a banker, just blowing off steam! It's cracked in the case that anyone have the fuck they want. Yeah, fuck you bitch! Good session, good session! The dow's down. No, but I moved here from Canada, so I am an immigrant. I wouldn't expect you guys to understand my struggles as an immigrant, but... I will say if you're gonna immigrate somewhere, I recommend you do a white skin no accent, for sure the move. I see these other people, they're like, I moved to country, I go, what are you fucking stupid? A simile brother? Came here to steal these podcasting jobs. I'm from Toronto, though, which is like a city. I don't know if you guys have been to small town, Canada, like you talked to girls, they sound like hockey players, are you familiar? You have red sex with a Canadian girl, they call you buddy the whole time. And she goes, oh fucking pop it in there, bud! Pass it in! She gives you a head, you got chewing tobacco on your dick. You guys are familiar with all this? You put a girl down, she just goes, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh frick! One of the time back there boys. Stands up and gives a post game interview. Yeah, just give it 110 out there on the bedroom, trying to get the dick in the hole and... People in America hate America though, right? Well, like half the country does, the other half loves it too much probably, but... I remember when I moved here, everyone was like, why would you move to America? What are you crazy? Americans are like, spoil rich kids a little bit, where everyone from every country is like, we want to come to your house, you have a pool and a trampoline and you're like, you don't get it, my dad's a Nazi! Which I didn't really believe, everyone was like, oh there's all these Nazis here, which I didn't believe till they started locking up all the Jews, right? Epstein got locked up. Weinstein got locked up. Anthony Weeters behind bars. Who the fuck's next Adam Sandler? Not on my watch. You're gonna fucking lock up the Sandman? This is the best way to describe America. Half the country really loves gay people and half the country really loves troops. Those are the two sides. Those are the right? Half of America's like, I fucking wish I was gay or were my kids to be gay? But yeah, and the other half's like, I fucking suck a troop's dick, nothing gay about that! There's a Patriots cock in your mouth. Dick stuck for America! I don't even know this, but a lot of the gay clubs in New York don't let veterans into the club just because they have a dress code and they're homeless, which makes it difficult. Found out which one this guy is, huh? Hades Gays this guy. Probably one thing that I was wrong about with New York though is that, so on the internet every girl would be like, you know, I get a cat called a hundred times a day, people are calling me hot. And then you'd see some of the girls and you're like, okay, right? Is a hundred times a day for you? Does he amount? And I moved, you're like, it might be fucking 200 times a day. These guys are girls that be coming by bed in a stretch or nine guys are like the pussy ain't dead? Like, creative with their heckles here too. I heard a one guy, he looked at her, and he goes, girl, you got a nice right titty and a left titty. There's gotta be like all school New Yorkers where that's their cute story of how they met. Grandma, how'd you and grandpa meet? And the grandma was just like, I was walking through a dark alley. Your grandfather and nine of his boys were there and they looked at me and yelled, girl, tell me how that ass do bitch. You didn't want to give it a ball at once, but then your grandfather told me both my tittys look nice. Crazy shit dudes are doing for the pooping thing, huh? I guess kind of most stuff, like I do stuff for good. Like, I have a backboard on my bed, that's not for me. I already have a backboard, it's called a wall. And we put a second wall in front of our wall because girls are needy. Even Donald Trump wasn't like, I need two walls. Do you know how much guys do stuff for girls? Look at every other country where the girls aren't allowed to speak. The guys just wear pajamas all day long. Pajamas sandals to a wedding! Playoff beards all year round. Not even cricket playoffs. Yeah, yeah, what are you gonna do? The girls just like, shave your beard. The guys just like, hope people, ho, ho, ho, ho, you know what I'm looking for. Translation, you just bought three more years and not drive in bitch. That is pretty wild though, hey? Telling your girls you can't do stuff and then blaming on God. Your girls like, we want to drive! Why can't we drive? You're like, he's weird. I don't know, you know. You put it in the book and that's what the situation is. We can't do that here, you know? You're fucking your girls. I need you to come to a DJ event with the eye to my friends and you're like, I'll run it by him but I don't... Doesn't sound like something he began to do personally. He come back, he must have been in a mood because he wants you to do the laundry. That's what he prefer. He was very clear on that. He was an exact word. He was mysterious. I'm not religious personally, I'm not gonna worship some dude, I'm not gay. While people are always like, oh, you should worship him and I'm like, yeah, maybe put some tits on him. I'll consider it. Jewish is kind of the funnest religion, right? Just because your Bible is really wishy-washy how to get into heaven. You just have to sort of lawyer your way in. No, in a bad way, it's just got the best loopholes. Like, sir, right? Yeah, you know, like the Orthodox Jews that aren't supposed to touch electricity but then they just hire everyone to turn all their shit on for them. As if God's like, hey, you're not supposed to, oh, well played. Two heavens for you. Catholics do have their loopholes though, right? Like Catholics will be like, no sex before marriage and then certain Catholics will be like, what if we fucking the ass, that's cool, right? Yeah, you're like, probably. That's probably the system. You get to heaven, God's like, you can't get in yet sex before marriage. Here's the photo and you're all cocky like, Assuming on that photo, God. God's like, that's an ass fuck. Get the hell in here. Get in here. Not gonna have his back door. I would say when I moved to America, it was probably like 90% of the internet was about Donald Trump and then 10% was like, someone with a disability doing like an inspirational thing. You know, people cheer him for it. Like, you know, that's a good part. Like a guy in a wheelchair that like climbed up a hill, right? Like a woman playing chess, like overclocked adversity. You know, I don't even think, if I'm being honest, I would say on average, men are dumber. They're just better up mad. Is that fair? She, people are looking at, okay, sorry. I just said this. Average is when you add them up and then divide. It's gone, I'm irrelevant to the joke, whatever. I think we just pretend we're not dumb differently. Like, dudes will be like, I'm street smart, which means fucking recorded. Street smart is like, I didn't finish high school, but I'll get you an eight-ball a crack at 2pm. Street smarts. And girls will be like, I'm emotionally intelligent, which means a basket of problems. Run from this woman. Who thinks she invented a new type of intelligence, which is just her crying? Calling you ballin' her eyes out from work. My intelligence is acting up again. Dumbest person you know every time's a dude. That's just, I was hanging out with my buddy, we were hanging out and he goes, you know, I was thinking about it. I do everything better when I'm high. I drive better high, I think better high, I write better. And I'm like, well, yeah, you're a drug addict. Like, that's how that works. If my barber is a heroin addict, I don't want today to be the day that he gets off of the stuff. Don't really make heroin the secret ingredient for a good cut. I feel like even as I'm saying that, there's some guys in this crowd looking at me like, no, I actually do drive better high though. And I'm like, alright, let me ask you a question. If you go on a plane and the pilot came out big, like, yeah, are you like, that's gonna be a safe flight. Yeah, I feel like, feeling confident. This guy's ripping bombs. I'm like, this is a fucking purple haze right here. Oh, I can see all these people here. This kind of fucked up. You guys are tripping me out. Your pilot's going back through the Bob Marley beads to the cockpit. Yeah, this is your pilot speaking. You ever just look up in this guy and think, well, just specs a dust. What really happened in 9-11? Yeah, you don't want your pilot to ramp on about steel beams, do you? Yeah, I don't think dudes are so great. You know, right now there's some guy on a Dayton girls about crypto and, you know, his co-fit theory. You know, the situation is. But the good news ladies is that men commit suicide out of three times higher rate because the future's female. So that's the good news. That's the future. What? Do you don't think that's what it is? What do you think? Do you think the God's just killing off the sad boys to make more pussy for the rest of us? Two chicks predict the way a lawn tended. That's where you go. Well, no, why do men commit? Do you think the men are more depressed or they're just better following through on their plans? What do you guys think? Well dudes, you're on a little extreme. It's like, I'm going to kill myself. When you go take a day. Girls is more like, you know what? That's it. I'm killing myself. Like, you guys hear him about to... Two flinstown vitamins? Yeah. Instagram story, good bye, cruel world. You know what I honestly think? And this is a positive to girls. I think girls are just better rationalizing a bad situation. That's why, you know, they'll be with some dude like 85 years old DJ from Brooklyn, like, you know, fucking, this is here. You know, one more mixtape we got this, you know. I have a friend. She's a girl. She got in a car accident. She comes back, she goes, you know what guys? I think I needed to go through that. What? You needed to go through what? The red light? How are you possibly trying to make this positive? Girls will be going to jail for life like part of a woman's journey, you know. You're like, you murdered your children. It's like, well, yeah, I needed to focus on me. You heard of it? Well, you hear a lot, you know, people talk a lot about the wage gap. But you never really hear people talk about the red hair gap. And I don't think you guys know this, but people with red hair make less money than people with a red hair. Do you know that? Yeah, that's true. I know what you guys are all thinking. Like, it's probably the jobs they take. Like, there's less money. You're being a carnival operator, backyard wrestler. Or biting the heads off chickens at the state fair. I'm allowed to do these jokes because I have some reds in my beard, so I identify as part of the community. Yeah, I'm sort of like the Elizabeth Warren of the red hair community. Drop of ginger. My ginger doll is all. I don't weird thing though recently though. A girl came up and she goes, hey, I have a compliment for you. I like your hair. It's so wacky. I go, yeah, I don't know. Fackies a compliment. What you guys think is wacky a compliment? Like, if I came up to a girl tonight and I'm like, yo, you have the wackiest tits. Wacky tits. All right, stop. Don't give me start on that wacky vagina. Wait, you guys don't know who wacky is vagina? You never seen this? You take the girls pants off. There's a mini golfing windmill in front of the vagina. You have to time your strokes just right to get. And if you do manage to get your dick it unlocks some other shit. Two gnomes jump out with riddles. One of us is lying. One of us is telling the truth. Wacky vagina. But I would never say that too because I'm not mean. Well, that's it is contrary because dudes aren't me. Like, girls not to say like the real hurtful shit. You know, guys are like, you're stupid and girls are like, yeah, well, your brother's the hot one. Oh, real? Zero to a hundo. I was watching a couple arguments and a bar and the guy goes, you're a fucking bitch. This and that and the girl looks at him. She goes, my last boyfriend made three times as much money as you all. Like fuck. Real shame that hurts feeling. I didn't even know what to do. He was just like, okay. Well, you know, I'm trying, Jennifer. Get to go home. That's not how you heard girls feelings by calling her a bitch. What you need to do is break her down slowly with little comments, but her physical appearance. If you want me that guy, you know, just little shit. Like, what your eyes always that far apart? Like, just a little comment. You're in there. Well, recently, my girl was like, oh, I don't even think I'm hot. Six months ago, she thought she was gorgeous. So that's progress I've made. You guys don't have to do, I'll give you an example. Okay, we can talk about hot chicks obviously because there's none here, right? And, um... Well, there obviously is, but I'm just trying to lower the girl's self-esteem a bit for the boys. Boy, boy, boy. My goal is for you to be leaving with your girl tonight in the car. She's like, I've been thinking, I don't even deserve you. You're like, that comedian. Looking it up for the fellas. My relatable dude material. Girls, you wouldn't get earmuffs. You won't even understand it either way, but they, every guy in this room has been there, right? We're having sex with our girl and she's like deeper, but we are to give her the full one and a half inches fella. Oh, what? Dude shit! What? Dude shit! Yeah, right? She's all like harder and what do we say? Yeah, you would want a harder, right? Yeah, and what does our girl say? No, get your dick's harder. You've been finger-splinting a soft penis into my vagina. Dude shit! Dude shit! You've been pinched! You're looking at me, like that's never happened. You know, your girl's like you're making me wet, but you've been peeing in her fella. Fell off! You've been pinched, dude shit! Gloss it! She's been all girly, right? Like, look me in the eyes, right? And we gotta be like, I'm not taking my VR goggles off. For you or anybody? Foo-chit! Classic, we've all been there, right? You're having sex with your girl, but you're not enjoying it because we're gay. BLEEEEEEEES! BLEEEEEEEES! That was a good one. Pretty sick, yeah? You guys have been following this whole COVID-19 thing? Um... Well, it is kind of annoying, right? Like, every day Fell-chees on the news, and it's just so hard not to come. He's like, I want to give you an injection. We're like, I've been waiting, I fucking... So fucking hot, the Fell-che. What have you saw this? But you guys, do you remember there were these rabbis that said they thought the coronavirus vaccine was making people gay? Yeah, which is a pretty funny way to come out of the closet, right? Your wife comes home, you're blowing it, dude. Like, the fucking vaccine, baby! Your beef is a Bill Gates! That's legal here, right? Gay marriage? I was like, what, two years ago? You guys finally... No, is that not the most American thing ever? The 2015 gay marriage was legal by 2016 Americans were already yelling at other countries that haven't done it yet. Americans are like the person who gets sober and shows up to the party. Like, you're all fucking degenerates! You're a day ago! No, I have a... I have really good gay, though. I can actually tell us someone's gay. What I do is I suck your dick, and if I taste poo on it, I know. I report it to the authorities. They say, Saudi Arabia, we got one. No, no, my brother's gay. No one cares of your gay. Like, my brother's gay and he came with a closet. He thought my dad would care. My dad just gave him a hug and whispered in his ear. So, everyone's family deals with it differently. No, but he wasn't the gay pride parade. I mean, my family all went there to boo him. Have you guys been to the gay pride parade? It's the funnest parade. It's literally the only parade where a grown man can helicopter his dick in front of crowd of people and everyone cheers for it. This is progress! I did that of the Thanksgiving parade and I got such a different reaction. Possibly because my dick was erect. But, other parades could learn from that. Like, there's titties out. I went to the cancer march. Zero titties. This is not that kind of parade. You guys always think the worst of me, huh? Okay, you know what? I agree that we just crossed the line and... But, all jokes aside, I didn't want any money to the cancer march. I told them cure cancer. I told them the gay pride parade to help them cure gay. I said... I said, here's $20. I hope you guys find a cure for this whole thing. And they said, we're trying to spread this. I said, what the heck excuse me? I'll be taking that back. Being gay would rule though, right? They have the most sex, which that's pro. If you actually think about it, like, that kind of proves once and for all that guys were hornyer than girls, I think, right? When you leave the boys to their own devices, they... They're gonna get down, right? But I don't know, ladies, it's 2022. Clap if you think sometimes girls could be just as horny as guys. Yeah. No, I don't really think so, but I just want everyone to know where the hoser is at. So... Thirsty... Thirsty... Do what you will with that information. No, it's true. It's gay people have the most sex, straight people have the second most, then lesbians have the least sex. That's zero sex because you need a penis for sex. And... You know, I don't even think that's true, but like, I'm just stupid. This, honestly, I'm dumb. If you guys tell me why when two girls eat each other out, they call it sex. I had a girl out in high school and told everyone I fucked her, it became Ryan the liar for... I mean, Tyler's semester. To me, it feels like a double standard. She just got it. She's like, you killed the cat? The cat, okay. Girls are a little demanding during sex right now though. They'll be like, you know, oh, I want an erect penis. You know what? I want your dad to stop filming. Girls will be like, girls say they're almost about to come, like your black friend says he's almost at your house. He is not left, so... Did black guys like it? Okay. There's nothing that makes white people more uncomfortable than race jokes. You guys better be on my team. White people aren't really in the good books right now, huh? Not really a fan favorite? Which I get? White people are kind of extra. There's two annoying types of white people. There's the white people, they're like, white people are the worst. We should fucking die and... These are killer babies. They won't even let my dog be trans, like, you know, this fucking type, right? But then there are still white people that are like, actually white people are the best. Let me show you some statistics and you're like, I don't want that even to do it this either. Can anyone be normal? Can people be normal in this country? Is that a positive... I'm the first one. I hate white people. I actually have a group of whites against whites. There's no blacks allowed, obviously. But... To be in 30 white people, we get together once a week and yell at each other. You're the problem, Chad. You're the problem, Ryan! What are you an Italian? Well, allow it. I don't know. People think it's so different. Are you like Middle Eastern or something? Indian? Well, yeah. What? Why is that so fucking weird? She thought a Middle Eastern was Indian. What a fucking idiot! That's like, what do you... What do you... What do you Greek? I'm Italian. You moron! From somewhere over there. I don't know. You got something going on, right? Greek or some shit? Egyptian. Egyptian. That's nice. What did she say? I'm Greek. I mean, can you believe this motherfucker right now? Where I go, what do you Greek or something? And he goes, nah, Egyptian. And his girl goes, yeah, he's half Greek, half Egyptian. Do you hate me? Well, I don't even know this, but India has the highest levels of domestic violence. Yeah, but before you judge, you fucks, talk about her people. You might also want to know that India has the highest levels of their wives misbehaving. So it's sort of a chicken and egg situation. Asian girls like me, at least, though, just historically. Yeah, I don't know what it is. I'll be like, hey, and they'll be like, oh, I got you, you know. Yeah, and I'm going to be like, all right, back in the trunk. I mean, you know what? You know what? Try this again tomorrow, I guess. If you want to join the others in the basement. Asians are crushing it. This is how sick Asians are. There's a lady in my gym that runs with her hands in the air on the treadmill. That's just how she does it. Yeah, any other race. You'd be like, look at this psychopath, right? Asian lady, you're like, what does she know? No. No. Not all Asians, though. I guess Filipinos aren't crushing it does, but yeah, you know, just unfortunately Filipinos are going to be in the cages with white people. 20 years. Just singing white people's slave songs. Never made it as a wise man! Don't waste your time, I mean you... Caucasian spirituals, that's her. Well, we got to pretend that stereotypes aren't true, even though they for sure are. But... Well, even like, okay, I'll tell you, even like the girls we date, I used to live with a house with a small Jewish dude and a big black guy, right? And like, if a girl came to the door for one of them, like we all knew exactly which one of those two... This woman was there to see. Like, you see a girl come in like basketball jerseys, like, you know, track pants, hoop earrings. We're not like, maybe it's here for David Steinberg, that's probably... It's probably your name. Yeah, maybe if she wants to get the earrings appraised. Even like, family shit, like where I grew up in Toronto, like if you tell a black guy, like a fuck your mom, it's very like, what the fuck you do? Right, you know, you tell me, I fucked your mom, I'm like, oh shit, Brenda's getting dick, huh? Can I use this against her? You guys might not know this, but because of like hip hop and it'd be a mainstream and stuff, like every white guy, like a little bit, kind of uses a black guy voice during sex. It just became the industry standard. Oh, what? Oh, you, these guys aren't awful. You're not a little bit, you're not like, yeah, what's up girl, you know? Like a little. Yeah, you know what it is. You're getting the head, you're saying white guy shit, picked up, you know what I mean? Capacapa coming, you can't fuck it. Don't work. You got a smooth black guy shit. I got four haircuts this week, what's up? Yeah, I got an uncle that's three years younger than me girl, you know what's up? Cool guy shit. What's the alternative white guy shit? Like, I'm gonna shoot this pussy up like a school. We're not hot? Okay, I agree, school shootings are bad. But men do it because girls like the bad boy. And it's unfortunate that you put these kids in this position. Why no, girls say they want like kind of an emotional guy. They're like, oh, I want guys to cry, but then when I start bawling my eyes out because my arms heard from carrying the groceries, that's not what you meant apparently. I feel like we just don't know what we want. Like, girls say they want an emotional guy. Part of the way the dudes are like, you know, I want a girl that wants to fuck all the time. And then you have that and you're like, this is hell on earth. You're trying to sleep on a Tuesday night and your girls like, I'm ready for round 15. And you're like, I don't have any more blood left. I can't be choking you while criminal minds is on in the background. The SVU theme song's playing. Bum bum. You want a normal girl that's like that sometimes. Not you can't go anywhere. You're at a baptism. She's like, fuck me on the baby. It's too much. Driving home. It's like, let me give you a road ahead. It's like, you're driving. This out of control. My parents are in the back seat with the baby from the baptism. We had to kidnap, but it's evidence now. You want normal relationship sex. Two or three times a week and one of you's doing it against your will. That's... That's an adult system. And no condoms either. So I'm on the pull-out method. You guys know what that is? You're going to pull a mother. So pull-out method is when you come in your girl, pull out of her driveway, leave town, start a new life in America. Well, that's a thing. Girls don't want to hear dudes' problems so we don't tell you. But, you know, here's an example. Here's a fucking sick thing about being a girl. You could change your image till you're like 85 years old. You know, maybe I'm cowgirl today. Maybe I'm rockin' roll. Dude, when you turn 25, that's how you look till you die. That's the fucking... If you want to wear like a new hat, you need to start prepping that months in advance. Well, like you guys here, can I take your stuff? You guys know what I look like, right? Okay, give me your glasses. But, you guys know what I look like. Imagine a fucking eye-come-out tonight for the first time. And I'm like, what's up? We doing comedy? Uh... It's uh... It's uh, boys' rule. You know what it is. Yeah, you know what the fuck, guys? We're in a hat now? You can't do that. Dude, I'm a buddy. You got an earring at 25. We haven't let him hear the end of it still. That's it, you fucking... Does you know this guy had to go to the mall? Go to Claire's? Sit next to some six-year-old girl. What are you gonna get it? I'm getting a sapphire. I think he's gonna hurt. Her dad's there. Like, can you not talk to my daughter, please? Is that a... Possibility? Here's another thing that girls wouldn't know. I remember my ex, she goes, you don't know what it's like to be a woman and walk alone at night and feel unsafe. And I'm like, dude, every guy's felt unsafe. But you're right, you would never know that, because we would never fucking tell you that. What? No guy's walking home through a dark alley, calling his girl like, babe, I'm spooked. Can you Uber me a night light? Dude, you can be getting beat up. You're like, actually, things are going better never-of. Those thugs are unsafe, because I'm a weapon, so... But I know, listen, I'm a tall guy, so if I'm walking alone behind a girl at night, I'll try to take a fake phone call and say some real pussy-ass shit to let her know I'm not a threat. Yeah, I'll be like, you know, lean it down, I'm such a queen, like let her know. She's in the presence of a non-threatening man. Does Craig want to fuck my wife? Well, that's between Craig and my wife. If you're doing it on my bed, just don't touch the Fauci bubbleheads. She robs me. I have a body, he's been with the same girl his whole life, it's kind of cute. But the thing is, all of his references with women is like this one girl. So we're hanging out the other day and he goes, isn't that kind of weird that sometimes when you're having sex with your girl, they shit a little bit and we're like, what the fuck? That is just your girl. But I do love the idea of him, like walking to the laundry mat with shitty sheets like, women, right boys? Anyone here into some weird sex ship before we go? She's fucking ramped up to tell you right now. She's like, what I like to do is in the morning, fuck a half-greek half Egyptian. And at night I fuck a full Egyptian. This is the weirdest thing I've ever had though. So this is, you know, here's a guy who's dating this girl on Tron. And she goes, listen, my finger in sex is I want you to treat me like I'm a 10-year-old and pretend that I'm 10. And I'm like, if you're going to be 10, I have to be 10 too. We have to both be 10. Because your fetish can't be that I'm a pedophile. Like, well, you're like, I'm 10 and I'm like, and I'm 55. Yeah, I don't know what worked for me. And also, by the way, we're in a condo with like thin walls, right? Yeah, she'll be like, you know, yeah, I just finished grade six, come fuck me. And I'm like, yo, keep it down. We have neighbors. They're going to bust down the door with the cops. Like, that's the guy and I'm like, no, she's 25 and they're like, but she identifies as 10. I'm all about her. I'm in the law. All right, you guys are the best. Thank you very much. I'm very, very much appreciated. And thank you to anyone who shared a video and told a friend who listened to podcasts. It's been very, very cool. Peace!
I got to do some international shows this year. I performed in Japan for the first time, which was amazing. I mean, I wasn't in Japan just for stand-up. I was also modeling. I wish that wasn't that funny. But Japan, the Japanese are just, they're better of being human. Can we admit that? They're more polite. They're better at design. The Japanese toilet? Are you familiar with the Japanese toilet? The Japanese took the most disgusting experience of human existence and fixed it. The Japanese toilet washes you, dries you, does your taxes. And that is in a Tokyo airport bathroom. You leave a Japanese public restroom cleaner than when you walked in. You leave an American public restroom with PTSD. It's good to be here in New York. I love this city. I, uh, it's great city. I have lived here 10 years. I am originally from Indiana. And I know what most of you are thinking. Indiana, mafia. The fact of the matter is, where I grew up, there was something very similar to the mafia, 4-H. You're a mess. It's never kind of pride where I'm from. You know, it's not like, we're from New York, what tough? We're from Texas. We like things big. It's more like, we're from Indiana and we're going to move. I'm going to have a year. Been a crazy year for me, crazy year. I don't know if you know in April, it was discovered my wife had a brain tumor. I'm not even making this up. It was removed. She's great. Everything's good. Thank you. I didn't remove it. I was in the other room, soiling myself. But the tumor is gone, along with my ability to ever win another argument. It's not like I was winning a lot before, but now I'm retired. And luckily, my wife's not the time to bring it up. Well, once she did, she was like, you know, I did have brain surgery. And I couldn't be like, yeah, that was like a month ago. It's time to move on. What about my seasonal allergies? We all have our cross to bear. It was crazy. You know, the surgeon told me the tumor was the size of a pair, which is scary, but also confusing. I was like, did he go to med school or a farmer's market? But tumors are often compared to fruit. A pair, a lemon, a great fruit, interesting fact, worst tumor, great fruit. Worst fruit, great fruit. LAUGHTER When you think about a great fruit looks more like a tumor than a fruit, I must feel sorry for great fruit. Yeah, we can't win. Well, ready, the worst fruit. Now we're compared to the worst tumor. Well, at least we help old people poop. That is the worst impression of a great fruit ever. People with glasses here, I trust people with glasses, don't you? It's like, well, that's kin. This guy's glasses. But if you're wearing your glasses like this, get away from him. Did you ever take directions from something that looks like this? LAUGHTER Where you got to go? 44th Street. Well, why don't we take my spaceship? I have to pick up Santa Claus anyway. LAUGHTER The only advantage of wearing glasses is you can do that dramatic removal. You ever see that? My God. LAUGHTER Holy mother of God. I can't see a thing. I am absolutely blind with that face. It's probably why I wear a... You ever notice when people are thinking in movies they're always chewing on the end of their glasses? If we give the alien a cord, you know what they're really thinking? It's taste like wax. I mean, sharing a meal with someone that's intimacy. That's why it was called the last supper and not the last meeting. Jesus was trying to get 12 other guys together. You know, there had to be food there. You know, like, you know, Jesus was like, tomorrow night I want to get everyone together. You know, there was one apostle like, Is there going to be food there? LAUGHTER Yes, there will be food. Are we talking appetizers around you? It'll be a supper. So casual, I can wear a robe. You can wear a robe. I'll wear a robe if you wear a robe. Jesus, he was in good shape, right? Jesus was an amazing shape, especially considering he could multiply bread whenever he wanted. Just like, boom, pretzel bread. You know? The Bible doesn't really specify what type of bread it was. Imagine it was pretzel bread, right? He's like, boom, pretzel bread, boom, garlic knots. Like, if right now I multiply garlic knots up here, you guys will be like, maybe he's God. I know religion jokes make some people uncomfortable, especially the ones going to hell. You ever get a phone call? That's annoying, right? You better be calling to tell me your hands are chopped off. It's like, I just wanted to hear your voice, Daddy. Buy my CD, right? I'm mostly healthy. I worked out today. I know I don't need to. When I'm home in New York City, I work out at the Chinatown YMCA. And I realize when people hear the Chinatown YMCA, they think, oh, that's not like a serious place to work out. And it's not. It's not at all. It's mostly little kids learning how to swim and really old Chinese people with their parents. I didn't even know you could live to that age. But I tell you, watching a 90-year-old on an elliptical really inspires me to die in my 70s. It looks like a machine is eating someone's grandma. But I love my Y. You know, it's different from a normal health club. There's never moments when you think, oh, my gosh. Look at how much weight that guy's lifting. It's more like, oh, my gosh, that guy's smoking on a treadmill and dress pants. It's very business casual. Sure, my Y doesn't have some of the amenities, but it also doesn't have the normal health club distractions. I don't have to deal with loud music or people that are in shape. I walk around my Y, and I'm like, you know what? I'm doing OK. Maybe I should teach a class. I welcome to advanced elliptical. It doesn't matter if you don't have workout clothes on. We're not going to be raising our heart rate. So let's step on, pick a show, and think about what we're going to eat. OK. Who's having a burger? Huh? Let's practice eating frosts. I'm ignored at my Y. I'm ignored at all health clubs. Like when I walk into a fitness area, even in a hotel, people always look at me like, I didn't know they serve food here. The only people that approach me are personal trainers. They're like, you looking for a personal trainer? No. You should be. So I've gone to the point if I'm approached by a personal trainer. I just act like they're hitting on me. They're like, hey, how you doing? I'm married. I don't think you understand. I understand perfectly. You want to get with me. But I'm taken. So you can look, but no touching. I love watching movies. You have a random movie that was released a while ago, and you enjoy it, but there's kind of that awkwardness because you can't talk about it with anyone. Like, hey, I just saw he... He saw that six years ago. I want to talk about it now. No loser. You ever talk about a movie with someone that read the book? They're always so kind of said. Yeah, the book was much better than I would have been. Oh, really? Would I enjoy it about the movie? No reading. Well, he took two hours, and then I could take a nap. I'm too lazy. You ever read an article, and at the bottom, it says, continued on page six? Like, not for me. I'm done. Why don't you stop bossing me around? Then I finally get to page six. I can't even remember what I was reading. You ever read the ending to a different article? How Gore is running from a waterfall? You ever read a book that changed your life? Meaning either. I don't have the attention. But every now and then I'll read a book. I'll be so proud of myself. I'll try and squeeze it into conversation. People say, hey, Jim, I read a book. 250 pages. That's great. What was it about? No idea. It took me two years. You ever buy a book and not read it? You feel almost guilty having it on a bookshelf, don't you? People were like, hey, how is that book? I haven't read it. Did you just buy it? I've had it since high school. Well, can I borrow it? No. I do enjoy traveling to other countries, seeing how different, but essentially similar we all are. Like, the UK is not that different from the US. If anything, you go over there, and it seems like British people are trying to be different from Americans. They're like, oh, you drive on the right side of the road. Then we're going to drive on the left side of the road. Oh, you call your mother, mom? Then we're going to call her mum. Oh, you call that a cookie, then we're not going to the dentist. I know that's cheap. I didn't notice something when I was over there. British people, they don't say the before hospital. You ever notice that? They're like, hospital? I was feeling not good, so I went to hospital. Whenever they would do that, I'd say, stop there. That's wrong and weird. Are you trying to sound like a polite caveman? And I had a friend from London. He was like, what makes you think you're doing it properly? And I go, because I'm American, and we invented the English language. It was a pet peeve of mine, so I did some research. You know why British people don't say that before hospital? Because they're dex. I know that sounds harsh, but admitted, British people always talk to Americans like we just walked into their jewelry store with two full bags of garbage. Man, I love you. Are you lost? Obviously, I love the breads. And I would never do those jokes there. I have been lucky enough to perform in the UK a couple times. And one time I was walking through Piccadilly Circus, which for the record is a horrible circus. There's no animals. And no, I was walking through Piccadilly Circus, and I saw they had an M&M store. And I looked at that M&M store. It just made me think of all the things the British have given the Americans. Our language shakes beer with a magna card. And I looked at the M&M store, and I thought, now we're even. When I looked at the M&M store, I wasn't even embarrassed to be American. I was just shamed to be human. Because as anyone at any point in their life thought, when are they going to open an M&M store? Sure, I can buy M&M's absolutely anywhere. But I like to buy and bulk in a pro M&M environment.
Yeah, y'all see them in a lot of fucking movies. This month, fuckers, blowing up, blowing up, blowing up. Recently from DC, living in New York, living in late everywhere, this month, fuckers bad. Giving up for my boy, Dave Shepard. Hey, damn, man. Back on the jam again. What's up, y'all? Feeling good? I feel delicious tonight. Man, check this out. I was counting my money today. And then all of a sudden, you have to do this, fellas, you're like, count my, you feel good, and you just want to call up my old girlfriend. Just like that. I'm going to say, you know what? I'm going to say, you feel good. I'm going to say, you feel good. I'm going to say, you feel good. I'm going to say, you feel good. Call up my old girlfriend. Just a glotin' shit. I call up my girl. I got all nervous in my stomach. Just like I used to when I called her. I went scared of her. Sir punk ass mother. Every time I called the house a mother answer the phone. Mean as shit. Hit out. I put on my best phone manners. I'm high. How are you? May I speak to Shirley, please? Who is? Oh, this is David Chappelle. Yeah. Hold on. Motherfucker. Shirley! Call up my old, you little slut. What? Oh, hello? Yes? Shirley's taking a shit. She'll call you back. Click. Oh, my goodness. There are four white people in the audience tonight. I've never seen someone like you. Hey, how you doing? I know you're all my feel uncomfortable right now. You know, only white people here. But you're not in any of that a- What? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? It's all right. They know you were me, so it's an anger fucker. Racist remarks, boys. I don't feel uncomfortable being in my- That's like a small, small taste or was like to be a black person. Like, I know you've been here tonight just tripping like, damn. Keep calling each other nigger. Wow. I don't know why the black people called each other. They may as black people. How many black people in this audience tonight would be angry if they were called a nigger by anyone other than a black person? By round of applause. You see, I used to be just like, yo, I used to get mad. But let me answer your question. Who decided the word nigger would make black people mad for the rest of history? How did they come up to that? Did they have like a big meeting back in the 1600s? Order! Order! We need to figure out a name. To call those black people with fan over there in Africa. The floors now open for suggestions. Baba. Why don't we call them winners? Blaners, winners. I don't know. Why don't you use it in a sentence for me? All right. Get off my goddamn porch, you winner! No, I'm sorry, I don't like it. Remember, gentlemen, they have those big penises. We don't want a flat or a mud, try to offend them. Keep a die-ranking, Tarah. Ezekiel. Ezekiel, get it on. Why don't we call them no-gooders? No-gooders. No-gooders. Let me try. Get off my porch. You know-gooders. I'm sorry. Doesn't quite blow off Matung correctly. No, no, no, no. Tell me the syllables. Ah, Ebenezer. Ebenezer, I don't like it. Why don't we call them winners for short? The whole meet and win craze. Wickers, wickers, wickers, wickers, wickers, order! Order! Let me try it out in a sentence first. Get off my porch. You nigger! Sounds beautiful. Oh, the possibilities up against the wall nigger! Pick that cotton nigger. This cab don't go to Harlem because we don't trust figures. I don't trust figures. Some deep shit, right? People always think racism is one side. Some people have little racist attitudes towards white people too. I don't know, man. I'm gonna tell you the truth when I was little. I used to think all white people were happy. Just to be white. I thought you all sit around fucking hell, you're white. Taxi, eh! Just check them. Boom, get out. Thank you. Get out. Dase a pair. See you. Give another round of applause. You have a good time listening to us niggers? That motherfucker, uh, clever ass, funny ass shit. Now, now it's time to say goodbye to all my nigger friends and bring up the hidden nigger and child you paid a bills. It's some different man. You wanna say something different? Thanks for coming out. God bless. Good night.
