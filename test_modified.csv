So they took him off to get the scan, and his parents and I sat around talking.

"My dad just sent this to me in a CHAIN letter with a GIF.  A woman brought a very  limp duck into a veterinary surgeon.  As she laid  her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his  stethoscope and listened to the  bird's chest.   After a moment or two, the vet  shook his head and sadly said,  I'm sorry, your  duck, Cuddles, has passed away.    The  distressed woman wailed,  Are you sure.    Yes, I am  sure.  Your duck is dead,  replied  the vet.    How can you be so sure.   she  protested.   I mean you haven't done any testing on  him or anything.  He might just be in a coma or  something.    The vet rolled his eyes, turned  around and left the room.  He returned a few minutes  later with a black Labrador Retriever.  As the  duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood  on his hind legs, put his front paws on the  examination table and sniffed the duck from top to  bottom.  He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes  and shook his head.   The vet patted the dog on  the head and took it out of the room.  A few minutes  later he returned with a cat.  The cat jumped on the  table and also delicately sniffed the bird from  head to foot.  The cat sat back on  its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly  and strolled out of the room.   The vet looked  at the woman and said,  I'm sorry, but as I said,  this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead  duck.    The vet turned to his computer terminal,  hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed  to the woman.  The duck's owner, still in shock,  took the bill.   $150.   she cried,  $150 just to  tell me my duck is dead.    The vet shrugged,   I'm sorry.  If you had just taken my word for it,  the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab  Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.    EDIT: OMG YOU GUYS I HAD TO GO TO A FUNERAL, SORRY I TOOK TOO LONG TO GIVE YOU YOUR FREAKIN' GIF.

"The only joke my dad ever told me.  My dad was not a joke teller.   He was funny anecdote kind of guy, and he'd get a laugh by telling you a true story of some crazy thing he did -- usually from his time in the service or a fishing/hunting trip gone awry.   In all the years I knew my dad, I only recall him ever telling one clearly identifiable joke with a set-up and punchline.   It's joke about racism, and my dad told it to me when I -- at age 10 -- asked him  Dad, what's racism.    We were watching TV and someone on the screen had said something about racism, and I didn't really know what that meant.   He got really quiet, poured himself a glass of wine, lit a cigarette, smoked it for a bit, and then finally said  I'll tell you a joke about racism.    Then he told me the joke, and that was it.   Here's my dad's joke about racism:  Four men, a white lawyer, a white doctor, a white scientist and a black engineer, board a plane flying for Chicago from Seattle, but get laid over in Spokane due to a malfunction.  While they're waiting they get to talking, and it turns out one of the white guys is a scientist who studies differences between the races.   One of the other white guys asks him if its true that white people are smarter than black people.   The scientist says there is only one way to answer that and proposes an experiment.  He'll ask everyone a question, and the quality of the answers will demonstrate the intelligence of the different races.   The two white guys look to the black guy, and he shrugs.     So the scientist turns to the white lawyer and asks  What was the greatest disaster in human history.    The lawyer thinks about it for a minute, then says  The sinking of the Titantic.    The scientist nods, saying  A very good answer.    He turns to the white doctor and says  Roughly how many people died on the Titantic.    The doctor thinks about this for a minute, and finally hesitantly answers  About two thousand people.    The scientists nods,  Very close, and an excellent answer.  Now it's time to ask our black friend his question.  Sir, would you please *name* the victims And that's what racism is"

"A man is auditioning for a role in an opera production the local opera company is putting on.  He's been practicing for this role for months.  He goes down to the opera house on the day of the audition, only to find he's come down with a sore throat and can't hit his notes anymore.  In a panic, he asks one of the directors if they can postpone his audition.    I'm sorry,  says the director,  but we can't delay an audition for just one performer.  That would set a bad precedent.  Instead, I'll let you in on a little opera house secret.   The director pours the man a cup of warm, smelly liquid.   Drink this.  It's a special tea to help your throat.  The recipe has been passed down for decades in this opera company, and I guarantee it will make you able to sing again.    The man wrinkles up his nose and takes a swig.   *Euch. * This is.  awful.  What's in this tea anyways.     Well, it's a secret herbal tea blend made with.  well.  fish broth.   The director replies.   Tuna, specifically.  We've found it helps soothe the throat better than any other fish we've tried.    Sure enough the man is able to sing again.  He hits all his notes and gives an exemplary performance.   At the end of the auditions, he finds the director that gave him the tea.   So.  what did you think.  Did I get the part or not.   He asks.    I'm sorry,  said the director,  you performed well, but we've decided to give the part to someone else That's OK,  the man says,  I'm just really grateful for the Opera-Tuna-Tea"

"There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath.    After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere.  The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there.  The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple.  From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.   Many years passed by like that.   At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.   With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:  -	Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon.  - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude.  However, the priest was curious.  He asked:  -	Son, why do you need this half of a lemon.  - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.   A week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard.  The man said:  -	Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon.  - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request.  Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon.  Placed it in the stranger’s hand and immediately he asked:  -	Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon.  - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him.  He wasn’t in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted.  He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio.  It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday.  The priest didn’t even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon.  He received these words from the man:  -	Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.   -	Don’t mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for.  - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind.  They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river.  The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side.  The priest didn’t follow because he couldn’t swim.  He was annoyed when he got home.  He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km’s away.  He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again.  On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:  -	Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon.  - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:  -	Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it.  - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following.  Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him.  He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail.  They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine.  The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground.  He was cursing everything as he walked back home.  The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely.  The priest didn’t care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting.  On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock.  In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance.  The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up.  In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.   -	Priest, please be good.  - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:  -	Son, why do you need it for God’s sake.  - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him.  They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up.  The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine.  The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine.  Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across.  There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages.  The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow.  He was furious but he went home.  He spent every day at the village’s locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock.  On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man.  He was there on time.   -	Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon.   -	There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger’s arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:  -	But what do you need it for.  - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest’s hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind.  Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest’s face.  Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools.  In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open.  Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest’s fierce and triumphant look.  The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:  -	Son.  You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks.  I’m very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it.   -	All right, priest .  - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone The priest was good, and never told anyone"

"President John Tyler may have been the father of the Dad Joke **Some Background Info**  On March 4, 1841, William Henry Harrison became the 9th President of the United States, with John Tyler as his VP.   Exactly one month later, Harrison died, leaving Tyler as the 10th President of the United States.  Tyler was elected as a Whig, but chose many Democrats to work in his administration, and often made decisions in the Democratic favor.   This made the Whig party angry, and while the Democrats liked some of his actions, they didn't *love* him.   At the end of his presidency, the Whigs were not going to support reelection efforts, and the democrats just liked other people more.   This earned him the nickname,  The President Without A Party.      **The Dad Joke**   At the very end of his presidency, Mrs.  First Lady wanted to have celebration.   She invited lots of people over, and they all had a good time on Tyler's lawn.   Tyler stood on his balcony, looking over all the people have a joyous time when he announced, ** Never again can anybody say that I was a president without a party ** and giggled his way into retirement"
