    "transcript": " New York is baffling in that it's a city that prides itself on being an absolute shithole. It's like there's nothing good here and people are proud of that. They're happy. Oh, it's overpriced and it's overpopulated and it stinks like piss. And comics, comics film specials here and they all open with a joke about, yeah, they spend $8,000 a month for nine square feet and you go, why don't you fucking leave here? Why do people stay here? But unfortunately this is where comedy works, where people are the most miserable. They'd rather be filming a special on a beach in Costa Rica at a tiki bar right now, but they don't need comedians. They're already smiling. They're already happy, naturally. So that's why I'm doing this special here because it's the last fucking place I want to be. I'm going to be smoking through this whole set because that's one of the loopholes in the law. They keep in the smoking beds. They keep, if it's part of a theatrical production, a loophole in the law because they don't want to fuck up some faggy Tennessee Williams production and ruin the integrity of the show. So they leave this fucking loophole open for me. If the cigarette bothers you because you're envious, vote next time. How about that? Vote, yeah, every now and then. Figure out what the fuck's going on in your community. You know, you don't vote. You got shit to do. Leave it to old people with breathing problems who will never come here. This whole fucking generation is so unbelievably sad. If you're just getting to, like, party in age, you're fucked. There's nothing going on in this country anymore. It's done. Last call. It's just a suck generation. It's the most boring fucking generation in the history of people. It's all dumbed down and watered. When's the last time you heard stories about rock and roll bands, chucking TVs out of hotel windows, or any of that shit that used to be fun? There was fun in the world. Some of this is going to make me sound like a grumpy old fuck, and I am. But I have just caused. As people get older, the older you get, the more bitchy you get. Because that's just naturally. The more you've done shit, the more jaded you get. But I think we're going to be the first generation of old people. As soon as someone gets old, they complain about the new kids and, oh, these kids today, look, they're crazy. It's always that the new, it used to be always that the new generation was too deviant. These kids are out of control. They're crazy. They're amoral. Look at what they're doing. In our day, if we wanted fun, we just went to a barn dance. And we didn't even finger fuck to it. We were like 35 years older. But these kids today, it was always that the new generation was over the top. And we're going to be the first generation of elderly people complaining, but in the opposite fashion, where we're going, look at these kids today. These half-faggots. We used to do crack off of titty dancers and shit. It was, no one going to hurt. We had a lot of fun. We got some good stories and herpes out of the deal. It was a fucking good time. Herblisters bring me back. These pussies, they drink a red bowl for some pep and they prefer if you went on the patio for a cigarette. The closest they come to a fist fight is on a message board somewhere. You looking at my girl? I'm going to delete you from my MySpace friend. You've got some block user in your future, faggot. They're about to start piss testing for adrenaline in the workplace. That's how sad this country's getting. Now, you're shaking your urine in front of you. Is that yours, Donny? It looks a little cloudy. Have you been having fun on the weekend? Are we not enough fun for you here at the Verizon Wireless Family? You need to seek it elsewhere? I don't think you're a team player. That's why I love hearing people go, oh, that town, that's like 20 years behind the times. That looking place. Book me there. I had fun 20 years ago. I could still smoke indoors. Ecstasy is still pure, uncut and readily available? Oh, shit. What cavemen they must be. You know, drugs that are even popular anymore. All the dummy drugs, all the drugs that make you more boring, all the mood stabilizer, anti-depressant. Everyone's got some mental disorder they've been diagnosed with and they take a fucking pill. They push them on me all the time. I get ruined so many relationships because I think all the time. Sorry. Oh, geez. It's ADD. No, it's not ADD. I'm thinking. I'm thinking about a lot of stuff. It's not ADD. Yeah, I stutter a lot and I fuck stuff up. But that's because I'm always thinking, well, you're not listening to me. Because I'm thinking about something that's more interesting than you. I'm trying to build a perfect utopian society in my head. And what are you talking to me about? Bowling or what? And I do. I have a head that won't shut the fuck up. So where do your ideas come from? Do you have a head like that? Do you have the brain that just won't shut the fuck up all the time? You learn to work with it. Do you ever try to do this? I tried this in July in Tucson, Arizona and failed miserably. Do you ever try to sleep sober? Do you ever try to do that? It's completely impossible. I tried. I got a meeting at 6.30 in the morning. I got a flight to LA for a meeting. So I'm trying to be responsible. And I'm just laying there in the hotel. There's no people or conversation, no distractions, sober, and no television. Just your head on a pillow. 1 AM, 2 AM. Well, because that's when the carnival kicks in the hide here. You're almost 40 years old, you fucking loser. How long are you going to do this? How long are you just going to get drunk and amuse shitheads for a living? Well, there must be something that rhymes with orange. Orange, smarange, orange. As fucking music is playing in there and it always sucks. We didn't start to fire. Shut the fuck up! I'm going to bed. Three more hours. I'm going to sleep. My ex-wife is in there. You never took me to the botanical garden. It was always about you. You fucking megalomaniac. You never cared. I was dying of loneliness. It was always about the world. Shut the fuck up! You're going to sleep. I am not taking fucking medication for it. That's also where the ideas come from. I'll just pour some alcohol on that when it happens and try to even it out. You'll work with your prom. Everyone's taking pills just because they're afraid of standing out. I was terrified when my doctor told me that I had a unique and interesting personality trait. But then he told me about New Zoloth or Brozac. And I'd just take three pills a day and I'd blend into this fucking horrible inbred corporate landscape. But I don't care. They'll legalize any drug so long as that drug keeps you producing. That's all they give a shit about is production. You're kicking out enough boxes at the plant? Well, go. Whatever keeps you doing that keeps you vaguely content sitting in a cubicle. Go ahead. FDA approved. I have a job where I alphabetize insurance forms 45 hours a week and I noticed I couldn't concentrate so well on my job. So my doctor put me on Adderall and now I can just breeze through my work day. I don't even notice that my empty life is being pissed away underneath fluorescent tubes. I have no highs or lows. I have no good stories. I've just, but I'm getting a lot of stuff done. I'm probably the most boring person I know, but look at me. Produce, I just go ABCDEFGHIJKMV. You ever gonna take a pill for that? You're not concentrating because that's fucking boring and that's a natural reaction to boring. Don't concentrate. Find another way. You're gonna make a living. You have bills to pay. Buy less shit and find some fuck. Suck a dick. You're gonna pay bills. Suck a dick. I'm talking to you in particular. Because you're close. Whatever. Spin around the brass pole a few times. Whatever. Say you saw the Virgin Mary in a grilled cheese sandwich and sell that shit on eBay. There's a grift in the system. There's always a scam. You don't have to do it just because your guidance counselor told you you'd excel at it. Fuck them over. This country is so bereft of imagination anymore. So fucking those pills probably have a lot to do with it. I was a real slut when I was a younger girl. I slept with a lot of guys and it's not something that I'm proud of. But I'm in therapy now and my therapist put me on well butrin and effector and she explained to me through our sessions. The reason I was so promiscuous, I come from a military family. So I didn't have a stable male role model in my life. I have a low self esteem because I'm a little bit chunky and I try to compensate for that by having sex with a lot of different men. Maybe you just like the cock. Is that possible? Is that possible? That's why you slept around. You like that fucking purple meat hammer. There's a wailing in and out of your untrimmed winter ready New York sludge pot. That's fantastic. Take some cock. There's nothing wrong with it. Free fun. That's what it's there for. Don't take a pill. Take the cock. It's there for that. Maybe your clitoris is there for a reason. Huh, huh. Clit's there to attract pork sausage. It's one equal right. You'll never get it. You'll have every equal right in the world and you'll... Women, not you specifically. Don't get over yourself. I'm talking women will never have the same equal right as men do to just... You can't sling pussy without shame attached. You'll be Hillary Clinton's and you'll get equal pay but you want to go fuck like this guy fucks on a weekend. He gets high fives. You get whore. Whore. They have to keep some shame involved. I won't pick on you just because you're in the front. It doesn't matter. But I'm making a point and I know it sounds base or course but the reason that you can't do that as women... Pussy really is the main motivating factor in all of humankind. It really is. It's what gets shit built. I'm not a good for pussy. This is a flaw in the system. No clout for it. Saying that's the main... They know that as a catalyst and that's why religion and government have to control supply and demand of pussy. And they do that by heaping shame upon you. Should you want to give away more than the federally allocated recommended daily allowance of pussy? Oh, she wants to suck more than one dick. Whore. Shun your natural instinct whore. Or nothing will get built. They know that. It comes down to production. It really does. They have to keep that pussy like a dangling carrot. Something that's hard to get so he keeps running on the treadmill, building up more shit, sending out more boxes to the dollar store, pointless shit that no one needs. That's why cocaine is illegal. It makes pussy too easy to get. They can't have it. They're not having it. And pussy were suddenly easy to get. If it were simple for human beings to just relate on a regular level, if he could just lay down a big fat rail on the first date and you gack it up, ten minutes later your suckin' is taking a dirty urinal. You're lovin' every second of it. Yeah, no inhibition. If it were that easy, then you wouldn't have to spend 60 hours working in a factory and saving up your overtime checks so one day you can afford a spoiler for your Honda that's gonna attract a girl's attention. And then after a lengthy courting process and you meet the parents and sign the contract, maybe then one year on your birthday she'll suck your dick in a broom cloud. Eh, if you ain't got whore, should've done the bump. It's fuckin' awful, innit? This is gonna make sure you're produced. Bust, bust shit you don't need. Come on, diamonds and fuckin' flowers. At least black people do when they were slaves. You remain clueless. Yeah, same enough. Fuckin' get a lot of work done. Hard work is fine if it's a work of passion, but just to work hard to buy shit to impress people, you're a fuckin' loser. An empty vessel. Hard work, if it's hard work that you do for free, hard work if it's a work of passion, you're working at learning how to play the acoustic guitar, you're trying to find my prostate when we're on ecstasy or something. That's a work of passion. Sure, go, dig in, root around. You know, this is a work of awful. You worked hard to get where you are, no I didn't. I drank, smoked and did drugs to get where I'm at. I'm not glorifying shit. I ain't trying to build it up, but it really is responsible for where I am. I've never tried very hard. I'm here because drugs expanded my imagination and made me think outside of your reality. And cigarettes gave me the patience to sit and write those thoughts down in a comedy-friendly format that you could understand. And the alcohol gives me the courage to stand up here in front of you, judgemental pricks, and do it with a quarter million dollars worth of cameras in your face. I didn't fucking work hard for this show. I am ill-prepared. There are people here from the first show, and you know, wow, that's a lot of different material. Yeah, just membered. Right? I didn't want to try hard for this show because I didn't want to send the wrong message to the kids who might be watching at home. I'll fucking work hard. Tell me you die at the end, did anyone tell you? Sorry. That's the alcohol. But it makes me funnier. That's why I'm drinking. Ironically, I'm drinking to be more professional because I'm funnier when I'm drunk. I really am. 17 years. I have AA friends that I've had for lifelong friends that all of them have had to eventually cave in and admit that I'm funny when I'm drunk. I fucking kill them. It's like they have to deny their own religion to admit it. They're like, alright, alright, you fucking... That was a good show. I know you're fucking ripped, but... Doug, you have a serious problem, and you make jokes about it, that's how you deal with it. But I've been in the program for a long time. If you ever want someone to talk to you, don't quit tonight, though. We have tickets for the late show. But, yeah, we've seen you sober. It's a stuttering, awkward wreck with no self-confidence. But tomorrow, you'll be like, talk to me. I'm up at 6 a.m. Fuck you. It's fucking horrifying. Have an AA guy tell you to your face, and he's supposed to be the know-it-all, and he tells you that your career is dependent on your disease. Kind of a scary proposition. It's like having your psychiatrist tell you that not only are the voices in your head real, but they're accurate as well. So I shouldn't kill the babysitter? I'm afraid so. I'm pouring more funny down my head. Pipe down. Jesus died for your sins. I'm doing it for your mere entertainment dollar. That's far more admirable. Jesus never made you laugh. Never once. He never worked all week. You can stack and pants at the Banana Republic or whatever you do and rush home on Friday night and dressed up to rummage through the Bible to see what crazy antics your slapstick savior was up to this week. We never made you laugh. He was a mythical, boring, unfunny fuck, and I love you more. Now watch me jack off. That's not even a regular tagline. Kind of detracts from the whole purpose of this joke. But the... Why would you... I don't even understand the connection. Dive for your sins. What is... He died for your sins. How does one affect the other? I hit myself in the foot with a shovel for your mortgage. I don't understand the... And if there is a correlation, why would you do that? Why would you die for someone's sins? Your sins are the only interesting thing about you dreary, bleak motherfuckers. Your sins are what make you fantastic. That's what keeps us great and exciting and fun. That's what makes you alive, man. You should wear your sins on your sleeve. You should be trying to top your sins on a daily basis. When you go to work in the morning, the first thing out of your mouth tomorrow morning at work should be the dirtiest shit you did tonight because that's what people want to hear. It makes you, ah... Right? You tell me a story. Hypothetically, you tell me a story about what a good Christian kid you are and how that good book has filled you with some effervescent, loving light of Jesus that shines out of every pore in your squash. You're walking on sunshine because of the Lord. At the same time, you keep the story going real loud. At the same time, you tell me a story about that one time you kick-fucked a girl with cerebral palsy. And we'll see who draws a crowd. Even you're on Mick Blee's slapstick. Jesus on a stick and have to walk away from you right now. Oh, that's very nice. I pray for you, too, but I really want to hear this. Start over! You did what? Was he into it? Oh, my God. What kind of industrial lubricant do you... I can't believe I died for these stories. These stories are fascinating. That's fucking silly. If you're Christian, you get cheesed off of the Jesus. I got Jew-hating stuff to follow it, so... I mean, you are a shithead, but I can make you feel like you're not the only shithead. Fuck, big blistering junk of Jew-hating coming right your way right now. I wrote this bunch of Jew-hating stuff. I didn't intend to. I was over in Scotland. Every year in August in Edinburgh, Scotland, they have the Fringe Festival. It's the biggest arts festival in the world. It's a whole month long, and I'm there in August, and some jackass writer for the London Times, he's writing a story about antisemitism at the Fringe, and they had found a review of mine from earlier in the festival, this antisemitic guy, and where I had been quoted out of context, like, oh, just a string of blurbs. He says shocking things like, blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah, blah. One of the things I had said that he quoted was, I hate the Jews, which sounds antisemitic. So all of a sudden, I get thrown into his little piece of literature, and I had said it. I had said it, yeah, without question, but I had said it like in a happy, fun-loving, Jew-hating way. There's no animosity. It wasn't even a bit of mine. It was just some aside when I was rambling about fucking Mel Gibson was in the news at that time, and I'm rambling about him being called antisemitic, going, why is he getting so much press? He's an actor. Who gives a fuck what he thinks? I need press. I hate the Jews. Give me press. And ironically, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang on the door. It's a fucking funny story. If you know me, if you guys have known me for a while, I've been doing this 17 years, and I could fill three CDs worth of just the Christian bashing alone. I've done over my career. I've done Mormon bashing and Muslim bashing. I'll do more Scientology bashing once I have a stronger legal team. But it wasn't until this phone call that I realized I've never done any Jew bashing in my whole career, all the religion bashing I've done. I never fuck with the Jews. I'm like, why? How did they ever escape? And they do. In religion bashing, Jews never get fucked with, because A, they don't have the aggressive recruiting policies that other religions do. They don't have billboards every 30 feet. Be a Jew or burning hell. Jew God is watching you. They're not banging on your fucking door with pamphlets. I want to talk to you about Judaism. So they don't get shit for that. They don't get shit because they have that holocaust sympathy they can surf on for another 15 years until the last survivor dies, or until history channel goes out of business. And the Jews, to their credit, they don't have the history of atrocities that other religions have. Because they fucking lost all the time. Sorry. But they're not like the Muslims and Catholics. I've heard so many comics doing bits about this new pope. Oh, isn't it scary this new pope used to be a Nazi? Not when you look at that track record side by side. The Nazis versus the Catholic Church. The Nazis only lasted a dozen years and they got their ass handed to them in a high hat. Catholic Church has a far more prosperous and prestigious record of murder and torture and tyranny and oppression and nonsense. Not to mention the kid fucking. And they're still around and more popular than ever. I'd be far more afraid to hear someone go, you know that new Nazi? He used to be a pope. No shit? I'm fucking out of here. That guy's dangerous. So fuck the Jews. That's what I'm saying. I guess... Fuck the Jews. I'm sorry. I never said it over the course of my career, but fuck the Jews. Just for being a religion at all, you're as complicit as the rest in the retardation of human intellectual progress. Fuck you too. Fuck you. My brother's a Jew. My brother's a Jew and I fucking fuck him too. I hate his guts for it. I'm like, I hate hate level, but fuck what do you think? He converted. Because the only humorless cunt in his life that would ever fuck him twice, he had to cave in and marry her. Because he's afraid to die alone, but he doesn't mind settling for less. And now they're together in a passionless swamp of a relationship. And they teach their kids that shit. See, the parents wouldn't have him if he wasn't converted to Judaism, because they're racist. And there's another reason to fuck the Jews. I don't like racist. Fuck you too, Jew. You're not good enough if you're not a Jew. Fuck you. Mostly I hate the Jews because they're wicked annoying. Can we agree on that? Really, they're wicked annoying. Of all the religions I've been around, the Jews have a tendency to throw their Judaism into whatever conversation you're having. Any topic, whatever the subject. Whoa, that's funny, because I'm a Jew. Oh, I'm a typical Jewish mother. And I think grew up Jewish. Well, my Jew family, I'm Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew. That's all I got to say. Jew, Jew. What are you saying, Jew? Why do you keep saying Jew? I'm at an airport bar with you. I have to talk to you. But can you stop reminding me that you're irrational in every third sentence? It's like people who are really into their astrological sign and they have to pitch that into whatever conversation you're having to define themselves. That's funny, I'm a Virgo. Here's my Virgo coming out again. You're going to have to excuse me. I'm a bit of a perfectionist. It's because I'm a Virgo. No, it's because you're a douchebag and you've been busting my balls all day. It has nothing to do with your astrological sign or some alignment of the stars. It's because you're a shithead and it's time for you to take individual responsibility for who you are. Don't act like if your parents had fucked a month earlier, you'd be feeding me chili dogs and letting shit slide. You're an asshole. Be who you are. I'm a Jew. We naturally carry a lot of guilt. It's a Jewish thing. No, it's a you thing. You that fucking did that chair. That's nothing to do with you. If you have guilt, maybe you're a weak of character. Maybe you're fucking guilty of something. I don't know. Maybe you just stole that bottle of Jager out of my freezer. But it has nothing to do with some ancient tribe of blah, blah, blah. That's not attached to your DNA. By the same logic, we all come from apes. But I don't throw ape in every conversation. Use ape to define myself. Use ape as an excuse to defecate in my thumbless mitt and then hurl it at you. I'm sorry. Did I just splatter you with wet feces? I'm sorry. I have a very rich ape upbringing, a strong ape heritage. I'm an ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape. I'm really worthless as an individual. Anybody who defines themselves solely on their race or their religion or their nationality, if that's the first thing out of your mouth, what are you all about? If that's the first thing on your MySpace page, well I'm an Irish American boy. You got nothing else. Community college and something else. But you use that fucking trivia because you got nothing to say. Useless. Yeah. I'm kind of out of shit. Not in this set. I mean I have some stuff I put on paper but in the long term I think I'm out of shit. Fucking cannibalizing my own. 17 years. What else do you have to say? If I die soon, don't ever say I died too young. Every time an artist dies young, I've only got nine more days before I'm 40, if I still have that three in front of my number, maybe they'll say I died young. If I have the four, died early perhaps. Died not as late as he could have. But every time an artist dies young, Kurt Cobain or whatever, there's always the people, it's so sad. He had so much more to give. How do you know? Maybe he was out of shit. I don't know, he's done. He got all the money, he did all the drugs, he fucked all your holes and that's the American dream. And when you're done with that you go, oh that's why they call it a dream, it's bullshit. I'm still empty. And he cashed out. Maybe, how do you know what any artist had left? How do you know if Jimi Hendrix hadn't had died? He wouldn't have wound up doing Super Bowl half time duets with Elton John right now. Rocket man. You're going, this is tragic. Why didn't that guy die? He was my hero. I don't want to see this. He's fucking pathetic. How do you know if Lenny Bruce hadn't had died, he wouldn't have wound up taking over Andy Rooney's spot at the end of 60 minutes. Just some crusty old cunt with wiry eyebrows bitching about ATM fees and a cluttered desk. Well you know, maybe he's out of shit. But back to nationalism. Nationalism does nothing but teach you how to hate people that you never met and all of a sudden you take pride in accomplishments you had no part in whatsoever and you brag about. Yeah. They get married and you go fuck the French. Fuck the French. If we hadn't saved their ass in two world wars, they'd be speaking German right now. You go, oh was that us? That was us? Was that me and you Tommy? We saved the French? Jesus. I know I blacked out a little bit after that fourth shot of Jäger mice their last time but I don't remember. I know we went through to Wendy's drive-thru we were going to get one of them fresh set of sandwiches it looked so alluring on the commercial but then we ordered it and realized we had no money and we had to ditch out before the second window. There's douchebags in line behind us with the bass music probably got our order and we laughed about that but I don't remember saving the French. I went through the last ten calls on my cell phone and there's nothing incoming or outgoing to the French looking for muscle on a project. I checked my pants there's no mud stains on the knees from where we were garroting crouts in the trenches at Verdun. I think we didn't do anything but watch sports bloopers while we got hammered I think we should shut the fuck up. It's silly. All that stuff tradition and heritage as dead people's baggage quit carrying it. Did you make it up? No. It's passed on to me. Pass it back. Every immigration argument that you hear they never come from a well how does it affect you personally? Well you know these immigrants they come to our country they burden our tax system what they do is they come here and they get in our education system and our health care and I'm going to pay the tax my taxes have to pay them. Well what the fuck are you doing to me? Every time you have a kid every time you have a kid because it's American I should pull up a Shays lounge and wave a flag while 15 of those things come out of you. Oh I can't wait to pay for these they're American. I have a vasectomy and an abortion on my record but I can't wait for all your fucking fat headed midwestern kids to come out of here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Quiet, boys! Get up. Come on on. Come on. Who are you playing the same time? in a town, Bisbee, Arizona, a little town. I can go out any day and watch Border Patrol arresting these guys by the dozen, 11 at a time, out of a Dodge Omni, like a clown car with plastic cuffs. And you're right, they don't speak the language, and they probably have no education. They don't have fucking shoes at the time. Barefoot and tattered castaway, like Gilligan's Island Shorts. They're like a dirty t-shirt and a dehydrated and wandering a desert for four days. And if that guy is as qualified for your job as you are, you're a fucking loser of such epic, humiliating proportions. I would be ashamed to have anyone find out that guy took my job. He doesn't speak English. Did they do your job training in pantomime, shithead? Oh, see, coming in. Point, point. I see point, point. Crank, crank, crank, crank. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're out of here, mullet head. Hey, guys, I'm qualified. Fucking asshole, you should have tried harder. Nobody bitches about immigrants taking their job if that person has skills of any level. You know, you're a fucking brain surgeon sitting around the Beverly Hills Hotel Lounge. You know what really chaps my ass, Barry? Scandinavian fellas are coming over, taking all our good neurosurgery positions. The Norwegians specifically. I say we down ourselves a bottle of Jack Daniels and go stop us a Ouija ass, the first Ouija we see. Jump out of that Explorer and pound him. Fucking immigrants. All started with that Einstein. Once they brought him over from Germany and we didn't have any good genius jobs, it was a trickle down effect. Steel engine job. Hate, hate, hate. Fear, fear, fear. Hate, hate, hate. Fear, go on, they're taking your jobs. Terrorism, you're trying to blow up your Ford Focus specifically. You need some fucking... Where's my Purell? I touched the doorknob. There's a new fever or flu. It's a big, faggot, silver, responsible, boring, dull, hand sanitizer generation and I can't get the germs up. He fastened up, I'm afraid. Fucking faggot. I try to qualify. I use faggot too liberally, but I use it as a word of weakness. I attach no sexuality to the word and if you're gay and you're in here and you're offended, I'll be at the door on the way out and I'll suck your dick just to show where I'm at no offense. I'm not gonna get wicked into it and like yank on your balls like you're coked up and that's the only way you can come. I'll just pinch you with two fingers and... But just to show that I mean no disrespect because it's too strong of a word to let go. Faggot is a good word. So you know, I got a little sore on my lip right there to match the one that broke out on my dick from this dress. Yeah, well you know what? I was a player, not a fucking spectator in this life, honey. You look at herpes like a skateboarder looks at a skim me when you play along. Ain't that big a fucking deal? And I ain't that indie anymore. I'm an old man and I'll give a shit. Anyway, let's move on. I was trying to segue into kid fucking but segue is gone. Let's just jump right in, shall we? Internet predators. Yeah, they're very popular all over the television. They fucking catch a predator in my space. Oh fuck yeah. I don't know because I was a kid at one point. I don't remember about it in this picture. But I remember we didn't have the internet but to avoid predators, our parents would go hey son, don't talk to strangers. Some of them might try to fuck you. And you go, oh thanks, thanks. Thanks for that heads up. And then you just went about your day. Does that not work for the internet now? You don't have to parent anymore? Oh the internet. Like they have some crazy way of getting around that don't talk to strangers? If you're a parent and you're in here, I know you don't want to hear this. You'll argue with me and you'll say that I'm twisting the facts. I'm wrong but this is the truth. That probably, a huge probability, when I say probably astronomical odds, Vegas odds, statistical probability, probably nobody wants to fuck your kid. I know you don't want to hear it. You want to think that child is so ultra fuckable that all the pedophiles, they're jockeying for position right now down at the seesaws, waiting for him to come out of first period. Wait for it. Not that chunky kid, the old meal kid. That's why we're all here. High five, high five. If you wanted your kid to get fucked, just to prove to your neighbors and your gated community that your kid's hotter than their kid and you sent your kid out as bait and you put him in a Catholic school girl's skirt with no underpants, and you made him hop on a pogo stick to school. So his little pink fleshy hind quarters shown so temptingly towards traffic, he would still probably graduate school, having never been pooned. And then what an asshole you'd look like trying to brag around a gated community at the next cocktail mixer. It's just by the grace of God that no one ever fucked him. It's only because of my hypervigilance in the work of my congressman getting more laws passed on the internet that he never got fucked. If I were a parent, I would prefer that pedophiles be on the internet. There's no more pedophiles in the world than there ever have been. They act like the internet is creating pedophiles where there were none. If I were a parent, if you exist anyway, stay on the internet. Stay jacking off in your basement in South Carolina, as opposed to the old-fashioned way where they actually went down to your schoolyard. They did laps around a playground and Smarties on a fishing line trying to fly fish little Junior into the Oldsmobile. He'd be gone on the internet. Just don't fuck the kid. That's what it's about, right? Just don't fuck the kid. That's all you should worry about. But that's not what... The attorney general, he says, his number one focus is to stop the kid fucking. But he doesn't... he wants to go after the internet. He's not going after the guy with the kid and the camera. He just wants to... they use that fear mongering to get more government control in your life, more legislation, more... Oh, no, I don't want to have to be responsible for my own kid. You take care of it, Mr. Government. And if I get tired of it, I'll just vote for the other party. And that'll make a difference. Let's off it, uh... Child pornography. Rampants on the internet. Have you seen it? Attorney General, oh, we need to stop this. Child pornography is rampant on the internet. We need more government involvement. I've never seen child pornography on the internet, but I've seen every other type of thievian grotesque, sometimes stimulating, always clever, every other type of pornography that two eyeballs can absorb. You get in a one good fruitless coquianc where you're all gacked up on blow and you're just beaten off till the band plays because hookers won't answer their phone at this hour. You know it's not gonna work. It ain't gonna finish it. This is a cold, dead eraser in your hand right now. Wake up, you're punching a face. You fucking wake up. Talk to me. Wake when we bought this shit. You're waking up now. And you just start clicking on random porn links and you got pop-ups everywhere and that chick looks hot. Click on that and you go everywhere. You keep seeing shit. It's never when it's advertised. 18-year-old amateur hot co-ed action and you click on it and it's some fucking bondage enema porn. Some fucking amputee porn. I see what, prego, popper, fucking lactating momo, all that flat top fucker. They all sound like funny shit. They all exist. They should have made fun of midget porn. It's funny to say, but it's out there. It's like the comic relief porn I look at after I just jacked off to something hugely uncomfortable. And I go, let's go look at midget porn and laugh. Someone's into this. You gay-tard. But it's all out there. All this shit. Never saw someone fuck a kid. I've seen three old queers. Go to my website. On the forum on my website. They have a thread called the tsunami of Pune where all these guys just post the most disturbing pictures to fuck with everyone else. Three old queers. Three old guys in their 70s. They look like any kind of, you know, fez wearing fucking Shriners, but now they're all naked. One's sucking the other one's dick and the other two are making out very passionately, which is more disturbing than even the blow job as the other two silver-haired, like, ah, seen that? Never seen the child boy. I've seen cock fingering on the internet. I've seen cock fingering. I've seen it several times randomly surfing porn. Digit in the male urethra. Objects in the male urethra. I've seen cock fingering. I've seen it several times. Yet I've still never managed to see someone fuck a child randomly. So if child pornography is rampant on the internet, cock fingering is probably occurring in this room as we speak. I have no children. If I had children, once people have kids, they get all fucking weak and they have that genetic defect that makes them want to protect but make other people like the government do it for them. I don't have a child. Maybe I'd feel differently if I did. Well, once you have kids, I don't know. I know I've had an abortion with my wife and it's been five years probably now. I just want to say still a great decision. Every Roe v. Wade anti-abortion rally that comes out, they'll find some fucking cry and come from a trail of park and put her behind a podium and pat her back so she gets attention and you go, have you regretted this day? I had an abortion because I was in a lot of trouble and I wish I had that baby back about us. We don't agree on much my wife and I, but we agree that was the best decision we ever made. Still five-year anniversary. Glad we fucking killed the baby. Five years later, still glad. Still happy. No guilt, no regret. I have a lot of regrets about how I handled the relationships but the baby never brought up. Just say it. In case you ever come to that point, we'll all regret it that way. We haven't. You don't hear that side of the story. I'll show you. I got this anti-abortion flyer. They were sticking them under. Everyone's a windshield wiper in the parking lot in this place in Texas. It had a picture of a dead fetus on the front. You know how the pro-life folk are so fond of the dead fetus photo? They get a picture of an aborted fetus and they run home and they blow it up large on a placard and they bring it down to their protest rally and they shove it in your face at 9.30 in the morning. Look at that. Look at that. This is what abortion does right there. Don't you turn away. This is abortion. You're like, I'm just going to the ATM. I'm not going in this place. Clear the sidewalk. The helium hung over. Barbed anyway. But they do that. The idea is that that picture is supposed to be so disturbing and so disgusting that it will single-handedly change your whole view of the abortion issue as though live childbirth were really pretty to look at. When that living monster is actually ripping out of you, it's all covered in blood and mucus and sputums flying everywhere and they're fucking screaming. You're fucking screaming. Everybody's screaming. Your husband's vomiting through a surgical mask while trying to maintain a comforting eye contact. This is wrong. It's a pretty big eye contact. And now your snatch and asshole have all been torn into one big open septic manhole. Look at it. Don't you turn away. Oh, yeah. You put a picture of that under my windshield wiper. I'll frame it and put it over the piano. That's adorable. It's a little sweetheart. But this little peaceful, freeze-dried, aborted fella laying all night time on a comfy pillow next to a ruler. He's disgusting. Oh, shame be that. Like I said, I've had an abortion. I've been party to an abortion. So, and we don't know what became of it. When we had an abortion, we just shuffled out the front door. We didn't tag its ear or keep in touch, track it on a GPS system. We didn't have the pen pals. No, we're fucking left. So if I see a picture of an aborted fetus, there's a party that's got to wonder a little bit. Hey. Steve, anything? Really like the at all. Come on. There's a little bit. I think he's got my scowl. I mean... Have you had an abortion? It really makes the whole idea, the whole concept of heaven a lot more disconcerting if you've had an abortion. But as a rational or a logical, as that idea is, it's depressing to think about if there were a heaven and you fought through the white light and got up to the pearly gates, that would be the first dead relative waiting for you there, all angry and pinch-faced. Oh, Nuku's here. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it took you time, didn't you? Looks like you were having a lot of fun down there. You know, they took pictures of me. They took pictures of me. They'd be next to a ruler for Christ's sake. Would you know my name? Should I... Should I get the flyer? He's got the dead fetus on the front. On the back of the thing, it's got the whole pro-life propaganda screed. At the bottom, the guy who prints these things for a living, for fun or profit or whatever his motivation is, he puts his name and phone number at the bottom in case you want to order more. And I'm drunk with a phone. And the guy answers his phone. It's not even a business. There's no... It's a dude in rural Wisconsin answering his phone in the bedroom. And I want to fuck with him, but I want to be original. You don't want to just be drunk and trying to throw logic at this problem. You're just going to waste cell phone minutes. That's like trying to kick water uphill. You ain't going to win. So what I did is I came at him and I attacked him from the more conservative angle where I accused him of being the worst type of child pornographer on this planet. This is sick! I can't believe what I'm looking at, sir. This is a child in this photograph. That's not a choice. That's a child. And for you to distribute photographs of naked children around my neighborhood, you're attracting the most deviant type of child predator on this planet. Right now, preterm necrophiliac child molesters are masturbating like frenzied apes in cages to your handiwork, sir. Don't you d-d-d-d-d-d-d me. You knew what you were doing. You could have photoshopped a bikini onto that little baby. You could have airbrushed a tasteful one piece, but you chose not to, because this is how you get your rocks off, and I hope you burn it out, blitz. I don't get here very often. I'm glad I had the opportunity again. So I can close strong and say, fuck the Yankees. I want to close with them. Fuck the Yankees. Fuck the Yankees. Fuck you, Andy. Fuck the Yankees. Fuck you and your Yankees. Fuck the Yankees. Yes. Fuck the Yankees for several reasons. You want to go through all of them. Fuck the Yankees, eh? They bought their team. Yes, they bought their team. They spent the most money they're supposed to win. Like, okay, not fuck... If you have money on the Yankees, different story. If you have money on any team, okay, go ahead and cheer for that team. You don't want to have stock in a company. You have an investment. You're cheering for that. But if you're just going to be some fucking blow-headed alcoholic, drinking overpriced beer in the stands, paying too much money for parking, and they're going to yell for a team, have some character, and pick it on their dog. If you're just yelling to yell, pick it on their dog. Why not? The Yankees are supposed to win. So for you to be a dildo, arrogant fan on top of that, that's like going to a casino and cheering for the house and being an asshole about it. Ew! Fucking zip up to the fucking Indian casino. Just set up shop right behind a blackjack table and go, oh, dealer busted your ass, bitch, huh? That's my fucking dealer. I chose that dealer. I got my dealer hat on. I spent food money for this hat. I'm hungry. What the fuck is that? Fuck the Yankees most, because they're the reason that you have to go outside to smoke cigarettes. And the reason that they just banned trans fat and food. They're telling you how to eat in this city, how to live your life, what you can do on your own property. They're just banned. They're trying to ban iPods and crosswalks. State Supreme Court in this state, 10 days ago, upheld a ban on dancing in nightclubs. Anybody know this? Nightclubs. Not fucking Utah, not Footloose. New York City. Tough guys, aren't you? You're fucking standing out like fucking bitches smoking outside. They tell you what you can put in your food, what you can eat, where to dance, where to walk. You can use your cell phone behind the wheel of a car with a tough motherfucker. Before you advertise how tough you are, you might want to go into the bathroom and do some of Bloomberg's cock smell out of your assholes because it seems to me that you are just little bitches to City Hall. And that's why I say fuck the Yankees too. Because the Yankees, what you were all rallying around and getting pumped up and badass about when you should have been down at City Hall, 60,000, and you're getting fucking amped up. Next time someone even mentions a smoking ban, there should have been 60,000 of you pricks, fucking booing and throwing batteries at the guy who suggested it. You distracted motherfuckers. I'm gonna go. See, outside smoking. I'm not stealing applause. This is where credit's rolled. It's kind of part of the thing. I'd rather be back there. Go sit down. I don't want this. It's not real. You're lying. I like you anyway. Fuck the Yankees. Just sit quietly. It'd be better credit to be honest. That'll be credit. That would be real for like 60% of my show. Alright, can I go round? Thank you so much."
