    "title": "Jim Jefferies  Rarely Seen Live Stand-up  Full Clip",
    "transcript": " Thank you. Thank you for coming to my show Alcoholicost. It's a big theatre man. I appreciate coming out people are watching this at home might know this is a f**k a Monday night so I appreciate how many people have come and I realized that in this economy tickets for things such as comedy shows aren't that cheap for men for women same price they've always f**king been. Women don't pay for things like this there's women in this room have no f**king idea how much a ticket for this show costs no f**king idea your husband came home said remember we're seeing Jim Jeffries you said who and now you're f**king here women don't pay basically women are a bunch of cunts to summarize women cunts see I don't have women even know that drinks cost money ugly chicks know if you know that drinks cost money you're a f**king ugly bitch but otherwise you're a good looking girl good luck to you see my my birthday is on Valentine's Day so even on my f**king birthday I'm buying some bitch dinner if I meet a nice girl and I'm in a restaurant and the check comes I put the credit card down and she's a nice girl she'll do the purse grab if I go no no no it's okay she's very quick to give up on that argument other arguments you can keep going for f**king years that one she's ever so gracious about this is why I think I like to be gay I think gay would be a good move for me I wouldn't enjoy the sex I'd have to get through the sex I would have a cock in my mouth with tears streaming down my face and as the jizz hit the back of my throat I'd be thinking of my happy place but it'd be worthwhile just so I could split the occasional bill that's why gay guys are happy and that's why lesbians are f**king miserable because they have to hang out with women all day it must be f**king horrible they must just be sitting there at dinner going I'm not gonna pay for this bitch I've just worn my best plaid shirt and shaved my head she better treat me like a princess now if there's any lesbians in the room and I assume there's not because laughter is not your thing but if there is I'd like to apologize for that last joke but if you hate men so much stop trying to look like them you never see a Jew dressed as a Nazi I did a joke in America I said lesbians have no sense of humour and they're not fine or whatever and these two lesbians stood up and stormed out of the room as if to prove my point they're just not fun people gay guys are fun I don't care how homophobic you are if you're holding a dinner party and a gay guy shows up you get a little bit excited oh yeah you're like oh f**king a gay guy I'll strap yourself in love hey I've got a live one right if you're holding a dinner party and lesbian shows up you're just like ah f**k me all I wanted to do was relax and play picture nary she's drawing something political you can't even point lesbians out and they're so f**king obvious it's so obvious you can't point them out if if you saw like f**king if I see like two lesbians in the audience they go excuse me you lesbians they'll be like what the f**k what what do you what do you mean by that right but if I see two gay guys in the audience they go excuse me you gay guys they'll go guilty because gay guys f**king love being gay the word gay comes from happy they like f**king men in the arse so much they've called it happy I I have been a heterosexual my whole life I would not call the experience happy I would call it a struggle at best I'll tell you another reason why it must be awesome to be a gay guy it must be wonderful to be in a relationship where if your partner's being a dickhead you can punch him in the head hasn't that got to give your relationship a whole new dimension I can't tell you the amount of arguments I've had with women that could have been sorted out quicker with a punch and why were the subject of domestic violence it's a horrible thing of course it is and now you ever met a woman who's like been married like four times she's like I guess I just choose the wrong type of man I've been married four times and all my husbands beat me and you're like all of them all four one two three f**king four they all beat you someone doesn't know when to shut the f**k up now do it because I'm a tolerant man I'll give anyone three but four you're a f**king button pusher that's a nice cheery way to start the show I do a lot of gigs when I lie I do some gigs out in Iraq and Afghanistan and stuff like that which if I was in an American crowd right now they go oh yeah but I'm not so I can be honest with you I do it for money and I the first time over there it's like I'm king of it the first time I go to a gig in Iraq they fly me and my manager in a passenger plane into Kuwait now it turns out that Kuwait is a regular country that anyone can visit then a military truck gets me and my manager and drives us over the border into Iraq and drops us off and we're standing in the middle of the desert of a war-torn country we can't see anything on the horizon and I turn to my manager and go good booking f**kface and then this helicopter comes in over the horizon and lands in front of us and the blades are still going and this soldier runs off and goes excuse me are you Jim Jeffries and I went what other white cunt were you looking for in the desert at this exact location then he hands me my bulletproof vest in my helmet he's obviously wearing his bulletproof vest in his helmet here's a camouflaged mine f**king blue and I said why do I have a blue vest in helmet he said that's so the enemy know you're a civilian I'm like does the enemy give a s**t that's my main concern because I've never been a sniper but every time I got off the helicopter I surrounded my soldiers protecting me if I was a sniper I'd be like the cut in blue looks important right so we got in this helicopter and we're sitting in this chopper that's what we call them in the chopper and I'm sitting here I've got two soldiers sitting next to me there my manager Brett's sitting there he's got two soldiers sitting next to him there's two soldiers in the cockpit there's a great big door open next to me there and there's another door open there and at that door there's a soldier with a great big gun on a hinge with bullets coming out of it like that thing that Chewbacca wears and we take off and off we go to Baghdad and as we hit the border of the city I hear a great big bang and these two small flares shoot up from the small wings of the helicopter followed by a trailer smoke and then the helicopter goes now the reason they do this is when they get over the danger area if there's a heat seeking missile it will be distracted by the flares and then the helicopter will fly out of range very clever now they never told me this was happening as far as I'm concerned the wings have just exploded and we're now plummeting to our death it is it's nice to know how you react under pressure because I reacted thusly by vomiting over my lovely blue vest ironically making it more camouflage than it was before and yelling out we're going down the two pilots the soldiers the gunner they all start pissing themselves laughing they're reaching through the high five at each other it turns out they've been waiting for this joke for months I'm cleaning vomit off myself going oh you got was a good one thank you for defending my freedom so I sit back down covered in vomit in the helicopter and so I'm trying to look out the door to try to unqueer myself I'm looking out over the ground over Baghdad by the way Baghdad beautiful city untouched and I look out in the ground and I see a little Arab fellow with a handgun shooting up at the helicopter just once again a freak out we've been fired on the gunner now is laughing so fucking hard he's laughing even harder than he's before he's laughing so hard he's killed over the guns is dangling out in the hinge and I'm like what's your fucking problem man and he's like Jim you're gonna have to calm down mate we're in a military helicopter with a bulletproof bottom that's a handgun we're so high up the bullets can't even reach us they just sort of go and then I jokingly said I bet our bullets can reach him and he went oh yeah and the little cunt died and and I was like I was just saying mate I didn't want to ruin anyone's day isn't that a fun story about a man dying it's funny though my limited time in a war zone I really you know I didn't see what all the bad stuff was they were very nice to me but this was kind of crazy to me because I don't know historically how we're going to talk about so you like my grandfather who fought during the Second World War for the Japs weirdly enough um no no for the Australians he killed a lot of Japanese hated him till he died love the food hate the people he used to say what a complex man I used to I used to love listening when I was a kid listening to him tell stories about killing Nazis there was always something exciting about it you know I I just don't know what I would tell my grandson about what's happened in history now I imagine I'll be 80 years old I'll be sitting in my chair and my grandson will be on the floor looking up at me adoringly and I'll go now there used to be these people called Arabs and they lived in the Middle East or as you call it the radiation zone in 2020 President Macaulay Culkin got really upset with the Arabs and he nuked them all but what Macaulay Culkin and the rest of the Americans hadn't realized was that China had slowly but surely become the superpower of the world so why the Americans were nuking the Arabs the Chinese nuked the Americans and that's where we have no Americans and no Arabs and then my grandson will look up at me and go you know what I like about that joke it has the feel of racism but you can't pick the exact moment like you know it is it's definitely racist so let's let's change subject quickly um how do blind people wipe their arses I know you're thinking the same as us but you're not thinking outside the box because wiping your arse is a very visual activity no one's ever just lent up wiped then dropped into the bowl you wipe your check there's a lot of poo there I'm gonna wipe again there's still a lot of poo it feels dry but there's still poo I think I left one up there I bet that's where the dog comes in handy oh no no no I'm not saying the dog licks the blind person's arse I'm saying these are very intelligent dogs they would have worked out some form of barking system so the blind guy would have the dog like sit in front of him woof woof woof woof and they they'd probably work out some special morse kodi bark for when there's blood in the poo no it's because they've already been through a rough time they're blind no need for arse cancer no no that blood always means arse cancer I I suffer from hemorrhoids I've done since I was uh 22 years old and it's very young age to get hemorrhoids but there's a lot of blood involved if you've never had one there's a lot of blood involved in a bad hemorrhoid I've had toilet bowls that look like abortions no I'm not it's not good and the first time when you're 22 when you get one your brain goes to arse cancer you're like oh I got arse cancer because no one ever tells you about hemorrhoids when you're young your dad never sits you down and goes when you get a bit older you'll be pushing a poo a little bit hard and a small portion of your arse hole will fall out now it's nothing to be alarmed about it's just part of becoming a man so the first time I got a hemorrhoid I didn't tell anyone because I thought I was dying obviously and I go to my doctor the same doctor I've had my whole life and he makes me I go I got I got arse cancer and he makes me makes me bend over a chair and then he gets a rubber glove on he sort of prods around my arse a little bit and he goes oh you've just got hemorrhoids there and I said I thought that only happens to old people and pregnant women and he went and you so so I live in America now and I uh people get so entertained by that but where else am I gonna put them we'll put that away for continuity in case they cut the jokes up differently there we go that's a bit of because I know there's people who are sitting home going that beer went like that then it went like that then it went like that fucking nerds so I live in America it's it's fucking blows my mind I live in America now I I come from Australia and everything I never thought I'd sort of go this far with my career or anything and and I find myself now I'm out there auditioning for major movies and shit man and I still feel retarded every time I go in there now the first time I went for an audition I'd been in LA for like a couple of days and my and my agency sent me to this audition and I went along and I met this girl in the corridor called Carla and I was really nervous and she could tell I was nervous and she sort of calmed me down and we had a little bit of a chat and she was really cute and we flirted together and stuff and then I read read the little bit and then I went home and then I got a call the later on that afternoon going they loved you you're gonna come back for a callbacks I'm like excellent that's good so I go back for a callback and when you do callbacks often they have you reading with another person so I'm in the room reading with this girl and it's the same girl from the corridor it's Carla right and we're sort of flirting and they're like and so we're reading we have great on-screen chemistry and all type of stuff then after the audition I said Carla do you have any taxi cab numbers I've got to get to me next audition she said where are you trying to get to and I went Santa Monica and she said that's where I'm going I'll give you a lift now please note at this stage of the story I didn't ask for the lift we go down to the car she gets in she unwinds me window she looks out and goes Jim what's your full name and I went Jim Jeffries and she went wait there then she called her mum up and said hi mum it's Carla I just met a very nice boy at the audition today and I'm going to give him a lift but in case I get raped or murdered his name's Jim Jeffries so if you don't hear from me an hour assume something bad has happened and call the cops get in Jim so I get in we got like a 15 mile drive I say fucking nothing for the first five miles I just look forward then eventually I turn to her and go you've just made this rape really awkward she fucking freaks out she slams her foot on the brakes she skids off the highway she starts slapping at me I'm grabbing a wrist now I feel kind of rapy and I didn't want to and it's like you offer the lift I didn't ask for the fucking lift you seem more concerned in solving this crime than preventing it so I raped her a teacher a lesson because how else would she learn now let's let's get a little bit deeper I uh I I suffer from depression I have done my whole life I've been suicidal on and off for the last sort of 10 years and it's uh it's something that I sort of deal with on a day-to-day basis and I uh I'm on anti depressives um but on the box it says they don't work if you drink so I'm not on anti depressives um but whenever I get depressed or down I always feel like a selfish asshole for doing it because it's really a childish act to be depressed um do you realize that we're here in the first world countries Canada America Australia Britain not Scotland Wales no you know these major countries they're all the good ones um do you know we have a higher rate of suicide than the people of Africa let's let's let's just think about that for a second right the people in Africa one in four of them are dying from AIDS they're sitting in a grass fucking hut in their own shit they walk five miles to get water with a fucking jug on their head yet they're happier than you you're sitting at home with a fucking pantry full of food watching fucking x-factor or 700 channels go I'm not happy and do you want to know why you're not happy because we were brought up on dreams and even when I said that you're all silent because all of you are going you better not fuck with my dreams you think dreams are wonderful don't you you think dreams are the great thing on earth you gotta have dreams you know what happens with dreams they don't happen you fucking you know what dreams are like in Africa don't die today don't die today don't die today that's a real fucking dream now I'm as guilty as you man when I was it when I was a young comic all I wanted to do is get on stage for five minutes and make people laugh and then I thought fuck that man they better pay me and then they started paying me and I went I'm better than these countries I better be a headline act became a headline act then I went to the Edinburgh Festival did the fucking act and then I went all right I better do it go over to America when I was in America I recorded my DVD in America and then I was like yeah that's too fucking right now I want to be a movie star and you know what I'm not a movie star I want to kill myself that's retarded I have gone further than a man of my looks or intellect should ever fucking go and at this fucking moment I'm in a sold-out theater in fucking London in the west end this would be a dream of mine as a child and you know what I'm gonna do tonight cry myself to sleep because I was taught to dream because you never complete your dreams you do complete them but then what you do you put another one on and then another one on and then when you die you'll be on the deathbed going my dream is to see my grandkids again then they don't come then you die fucking miserable you're never gonna complete all of them no one's ever gone I got no more dreams left I'm fucking done so I'm not gonna dream anymore fuck that I'm gonna make little tiny achievable dreams that I can achieve like for instance I was drunk last night so my dream for this evening is not to shit myself on stage now it might happen it might not happen but if it does happen I'll wash myself off and start again because I'm a dreamer but it's not our fault this is bread into us this is in our psyche you can't fix things that have been said to you as a child like when we were at school we had school teachers stand in front of every single one of us and go if you work hard and you put your mind to it you can achieve anything you know what that was that was a fucking lie you can't achieve anything nobody can don't put that pressure on yourself everybody in the world has limitations no matter how hard I think about no matter how hard I practice never being the NBA because I'm a fat white guy not a tall black guy like do you remember that fat fucking dumb ugly kid who couldn't fucking get you catch a ball you know those kids are like like if he was like one IQ smaller you get benefits but he's just he's just on the border of retardation right you know that kid was told he could achieve anything right you know what they should have done with that kid they could have got it oh hey Kevin you're fat prick dig a fucking hole you dumb cunt all right you fucked that up as well but no one else wants to do it so you got the gig big boy and while I'm at it if you're a dumb ugly cunt and your wife or your husband's a dumb ugly cunt guess what your fucking kids are your kids are dumb ugly cunts just like fucking you except they're fucking super concentrate dumb ugly cunts because they come from both of you into a bottleneck of fucking retardation but you still think they're the greatest things out of you go to their soccer games kick the ball John you're doing a good job he's getting better you should fucking lock that thing up but it doesn't matter if you're an idiot and you're stupid and you can't fucking catch a ball and everything in your life is retarded because you know you'll always be welcome with God God loves the stupid and the fucking this is the thing about people who believe in God they're idiots there's no there's no dancing around it you're a borderline fucking mentalist you're an you're an idiot you're like a 13 year old kid who still believes in Santa I'm still gonna get you oh fuck you you know it's it I don't hate people who believe in God I don't hate them right but I just don't want to talk to them I don't want to be around them it's like how I don't hate them mentally insane right but the mentally insane and religious people are the same fucking bag if I'm if I'm staying at a bar chatting to either of them eventually I'll walk away going okay see do you know I live in America so I have to deal with this all fucking day okay 85% of Americans believe in God that's mental here in Britain it's like 36% in Australia it's 27% in I think in Canada it's like in the 60s and in Russia no one do you want to know why because it's fucking cold no one believes in God so all the Russians they don't get to go to heaven because they were born in the wrong country born in the wrong country you don't get to go to heaven Americans born the right country hey you get to go to heaven you're born in the right place because God's very particular about where you're born right so half of you fucking cunts get to go to heaven because you're British and a few Australians get to go and then the Americans all get to go and most of the Canadians get to fucking go and then there's those dumb cunts in those musi countries hey they don't even believe in the right God they're fucking dead they're not going and what about those dumb asian fucks hey with that fuck cunt putter they don't get to go to heaven because they're made up a god that doesn't exist and then there's the Indians with the fucking monkey elephant guy what is wrong with them they must be retarded they're believing in the wrong God not us though we were born in the right country because God selects countries that's why they always say God bless America because the world's billions of years old and America's 250 years old and that's when God decided to choose a team do you know there's a web page called ask God where children can write questions to God and then through the power of the internet God will answer them I'm a bit dubious but no so the most asked question and asked God is were the kangaroos in the ark so children could ask any question in the world but a child's mind works like this they go I like kangaroos I think the ark story is bullshit so shazam and the answer to that question is although there are no mention of kangaroos in the bible it does state that there was two of each animal so you can be assured that there were kangaroos in the ark now why is there no mention of kangaroos in the bible could it be that when the bible was written Australia hadn't been found therefore no mention of kangaroos but didn't God create kangaroos isn't the bible written through the hand of man through the voice of God why wouldn't he mention the kangaroos they're such an exciting animal it seems to me that they only seem to mention things in the bible that are within a five mile radius of the guy writing it like if I was God at the end of the bible I would have lent in and gone ohy tell him it's round because uh didn't know the world was round if I can build it didn't know it was round now I just like uh religious people I didn't say I don't just we'll go back now the thing is what I hate about Christians is they start sentences like this as a Christian you can't start a sentence like that and explain to me that your rest of your sentence has any more meaning than the beginning of the sentence it means bullshit that's a little fucking get out of jail free card shit you do right because I can't get in court and start a sentence like this as an atheist I didn't rape her didn't rape her she was she was giving me a lift and now when I started this show my first routine was about how lesbians were fat ugly useless with no sense of humor and you couldn't applaud more then I killed an Arab man from a fucking helicopter just shot him dead then I said that there's no christ that christians are bullshit and there is no god and that's the moment when half the audience chose to be offended was that the fucking moment that got you how very christian of you towards the muslims and the lesbians next time start your sentences with well as a hypocrite now I'll tell you this last thing about you think you're a good person because you have christian values do you want to know what christian values are christian values are a load of shit what are christian values the 10 commandments what are the 10 commandments very sensible rules to live your life by but you know what's a lot of shit about them the fact that you had to have them written down the fact you couldn't figure out internally not to kill people don't steal really you should just know these these should be internal in you the bible is too wordy all the stories are too worthy the 10 commandments are a lot of shit you don't need all these things the bible should be one sheet of paper and on that sheet of paper it should say try not to be a cunt and if you do that every day you'll be a good person we're trying to sell this show to the americans I don't like our chances so let's do something we can all enjoy sometimes when I'm fucking a chick I go to fuck them again in the morning and they'll say something like this no when we fucked last night it was a little bit dry and now I'm sore now to any woman who said something similar to this may I say your problem my job was to get an erection your job was to get your whole wet didn't you get your whole wet we both had things to do see if I don't get an erection during sex I'm called impotent but a dry hole is the same as a flaccid penis a dry hole is an impotent hole and you're not a complete woman and you should be ashamed to yourself but women don't take responsibility for the dry hole if I go to fuck a chick tonight and I get too drunk which I will and I go to fuck a chick and I don't get an erection she'll go back to friends and go oh I went to fuck that Jim Jeffries he couldn't get an erection but if I go to fuck a chick and she doesn't get wet she'll go back to her friends and go I fucked him Jeffries he didn't even get me wet do you see the problem there I'm in charge of everything it's like I used to fuck this chick for a while I stopped fucking her she sent me a text well you know I just stopped calling her you know just ignored her and she'd sent me a text message a month later that went oh by the way you never made me come and I was like really you think you're the one who makes me come do you want to know who makes me come I make me come all the horrible thoughts I have in my fucking head makes me come you have very little to do with it you're just a container I shoot it into but let's go back to the dry cunts there are women in the room who are thinking maybe I wouldn't be dry if there was a bit of foreplay let's explain foreplay foreplay is what we do to each other to get each other ready for sex if I have an erection that means I'm ready for sex and I'm all foreplayed out now the foreplay that's necessary for a woman goes like this you've got to start by kissing them women love kissing men don't give a shit about kissing we kiss you because we like you and let's be honest we spoil you men don't give a fuck about kissing used to like kissing when we're in our early teens then someone sucked our dick and then what's this kissing thing why am I kissing this person why would I ride in the swings I've already been to Disneyland but we kiss you because we like you and we're a charitable bunch then you start kissing down the neck now the whole time you're doing this you're working downwards towards the cunt now you know you're going to the cunt she knows you're going to the cunt everybody knows you're going to the cunt but for some unknown reason you have to act like you're not going to the cunt and that you're enjoying the journey of this creature women you've got to give them a journey men don't give a shit about a journey if a man's driving from point a to point b we fill the tank we get on the motorway we make good time right where women you've got to give them a fucking journey you gotta take them by the water or antiquing or some shit so you think is women read so many magazines about how to send your man wild and how to titillate your man and all these 25 steps to do all these side of fucking bullshit or get a feather involve food in the relationship this is all bullshit play with these nipples these things are fucking dead they're dead to me these mean nothing you could cut these off and donate them to some poor african child without nipples i wouldn't give a fuck this is what we want you to do fucking suck our cock and cup our balls and when you're sucking our cock look like you're in a bit of pain because we enjoy it if you look uncomfortable anyway but back to the lady you keep kissing down now you're at the tits now tits are a mixed bag some tits you gotta be firm with some tits you gotta be soft with some tits you can bite the nipple some tits stay in and go in the nipple tits are like golf you play the course you're on you keep kissing down now you're at the cunt but even when you get to the cunt you have to act like you're not at the cunt you have to act like you've stumbled upon the cunt by accident so you'll be kissing like a dimply bit of thigh here and the cunt's there and you have to sort of almost oh hello i was visiting dimply thigh i forgot you lived down here i'm going no always a pleasure never a joy do you mind if i pop in then you then you lick the whole general cunt area then there's a bit at the top of the cunt if you lick that they seem to enjoy it this all takes between 10 and 40 minutes and and she might be wet and that's the foreplay that's necessary for a woman now the foreplay that's necessary for a man we just need to see you naked maybe you need kisses caresses compliments and licks when all we need is you maybe we take our relationship seriously so wasn't that a romantic joke that involved the word cunt 15 days all right we have to keep moving the show because i need to have a piss now because i've been drinking too much i always get nervous before things like this and i so i got hammered in the dressing room this is the show's called alcoholics and this um because i'm planning because to me that means the death of alcohol because i'm planning to stop drinking after this adenba festival i'm not you know i'm not promising um but i'd like to this might be the last dvd i record where i'm drunk so the next dvd is gonna suck balls but i think it's a cause of show aga holocaust and now because i live in america that some jewish people have gotten offended and i'm like no it's not like i'm at the holocaust getting people drunk it's just a funny word i tell you what though i did a i did a gig in poland and when i was out there because i did a corporate gig out in poland i went out to out switch see a lot of you uneducated people thought i was in germany didn't you out switch is in poland and i went out there and apart from the concentration campy bit in the corner the rest of it's delightful it's a beautiful little village it's i reckon their tourism board needs to get together and go okay we have a bit of a bad rap has anyone gotten the ideas hans give it to me yep that's true we do have the biggest tower of secondhand shoes in the world i don't i don't know i don't know if that's a keeper but ride it down yo hon even though that's a scandinavian name uh-huh uh-huh pizza festival you say as we cook 400 pizzas at once this bit won't be in the dvd it's a funny joke though i i like living in britain because my um my obvious uh alcohol problem um isn't a problem here before i came on stage here my manager the last thing he said to me was do you need another drink that would never happen in america when i recorded my special in america they employed someone to stand by the bar to make sure i didn't get wasted because americans they don't really drink like you people drink like they think they do but they're very into like drinking games which you people don't even have drinking games right whenever like i'm out drinking in america always meets like like college boy he'll come to me and go he did every plate beer pong and i went like what's beer pong where you gotta get a ping pong ball you gotta throw it in the cup if you don't get in the cup then you gotta chuck your beer and i'm like well let me just get this straight i'm trying to get drunk and you're putting an activity in front of me that may impede me from getting to my beverage i said they have a drinking game in england do you want to know what it's called drinking and this is how it's played what you do is you have a drink then you get another drink you have a drink have a drink have a drink have a drink have a drink have a drink have a drink you do this as fast as you can and if you get so drunk that your friend has to drive you home then you fucking win how many more do you reckon there is behind there there's a dwarf behind there mixing me a cocktail i am fucking drunk now i all right i'm going to tell you a story this story is very long the first three minutes of this story are very depressing just hitching up my pants firstly minutes of this story very depressing but there is a moment where this story takes flight and you have to hang in there with me until this moment and trust me that the story is going to get good i grew up at number three taramara street at number five was my two best childhood friends andrew and daniel conner daniel was born with a disease called muscular dystrophy if you don't know muscular dystrophy is a horrible disease that wastes away your muscles it's the same as leukaryx disease i'm not a neuro disease except you're born with it you get diagnosed when you're about six years old when you're walking right they put you on crutches by the time you're 10 you're in a wheelchair by the time you're 20 you're in a completely vegetated state most people die before their 25th birthday dan's lived to be 33 years old still alive and kicking let me rephrase that still alive he's actually died seven times in his life and been resuscitated seven and i once asked him i said dan what happens after you die and he said nothing so good luck with your religion and your faith uh i'll take an actual statistic now his family had since moved to melbourne i had moved to the great britain i went to do the melbourne comedy festival this is about a year ago i hadn't seen him in all that time his brother andrew came to see my show and then andrew took me to see dan and i went in to see him and i've never seen anyone live this long with this disease and he's laying on a bed his eyelids are a muscle that he can't keep open anymore and they're just he's just squinting through these little things and he has a breathing mask on him to keep his lungs working because the lungs are a muscle that he can't keep pumping he has a heart monitoring machine in case he flat lines in the middle of the night and someone has to resuscitate him and as soon as i walked in and saw this guy that he used to run around with as a child i burst into tears there's nothing worse you can give anyone in this world than pity you know i went in the corridor i felt like a right prick and i was fucking wiping my eyes off and i went back in and i sat with dan his brother andrew went off to work i mean dan chatted for a while 20 minutes into the conversation dan says to me jim i'm 32 years old i've never been with a woman will you take me to a prostitute and that's where the story picks up later because i went fuck yeah and he remember don't tell my brother he wouldn't understand i said that's where you're wrong i've known your brother my entire life trust me he will understand and against dan's will when andrew came home from work i pulled andrew aside said andrew look here's the deal dan's asked me to take him to a prostitute i'm gonna do it whether you like it or not but i think his brother you should come along and help out and andrew went we're not doing it and i went why and he went it'll kill him and i went he's gonna die soon anyway this is a good way for him to go like sure we'll have to answer a few questions and he said we're not doing it and i said why and he goes because mum doesn't like you already and i went your mum's never liked me that's why i'm the right guy to kill your brother and he said all right we'll do it but he can't have full sex full sex will kill him he can only have a blowjob and i thought that was fairly reasonable so we went back in and saw dan he was where we left him and we said dan here's the deal i know you told me not to tell you brother but i told you brother me and him are both going to take you to the knock shop tomorrow mate but you can't have full sex you can only have a blowjob and dan went i want full sex and his brother andrew went dan you're in no position to argue with anyone ever then dan reluctantly agreed now prostitution in australia is legal so i spent the rest of the afternoon going through the phone book trying to find a brothel with wheelchair access best afternoon ever eventually i found one the biggest brothel in the southern hemis for the daily planet or as the austrians call it four floors of halls it's a 24-hour brothel because australia is a go-ahead country so we decided we were going to go early in the morning like really like 6 a.m we wanted to go when and the place was quiet and we weren't going to cause a scene so we wake him up at 6 o'clock in the morning it's hard to tell if he's awake and we get him in his chair now he hasn't got your bog-standard fucking wheelchair he's got one of those big sort of silver looking things with their truck tires on it i think the model's called a hawking and even though his muscles don't work they get sourced this thing can move him from side to side and back to front and even into a full bed so we get him in the chair then we order a taxi and then it's not like you have black cabs out there it's like a normal car but they've modified the back to go higher and they drive him up through the boot and they strap him in there and he sits up high with windows all around him like a big retarded pope or as the catholics would say the pope and we drive off to the brothel now when we get to the brothel it takes 10 minutes to get him off the taxi i see this is my window of opportunity so while they're getting him off the taxi i run into the brothel now there's two ways that brothels work either the prostitutes will stand in a row in their lingerie and you just pick the one that you want or they'll stand around in a bar in evening gowns and high heels and you walk up to the one that you like to look of chat to her for a bit act like you've got some type of connection with an eastern european woman then take her upstairs and fuck her if you need your life to be this delusional this is one of these situations so why they're getting down out of the cab i run into the brothel and go everyone quickly gather around i haven't got much time and these 14 bemused hookers shuffle over and i went look here's the deal i have a severely disabled friend with me if you're not up for it speak now or forever hold your peace and one of them went how bad is he and i went pretty fucking bad and 10 of them said they wouldn't do it and i said well i respect that but can you please go and hide because i don't want him to be rejected by hookers and these 10 girls shuffle away in their evening gowns and their high heels we've got a rear falling out of them i i am now left with four girls the best looking one by my stays dan wills in looking like jabber the heart breathing like Darth Vader two of the girls run away and i'm like are you fucking kidding you sluts i just asked you nicely so i'm now left with two girls the best looking ones there the other ones are fucking troll now out of respect for the ugly one i go to dan i go dan it's only two girls working today mate which one do you want and he said the one in the green dress now neither of them had a green dress i stand up and look at andrew and went what the fuck is all this about and andrew went oh yeah his eyes are fucked as well now it turns out that dan's colorblind it's not part of the condition it's just unfortunate so i sat with the hooker now i'm gonna pay for everything now the reason i'm gonna pay for everything is simple i told dan and andrew that i would pay for everything as long as i got to tell this story to hundreds of thousands of people in the future and they said of course you can jim but be respectful and change our names which sounds like the right thing to do now doesn't it now i haven't changed their names their names are andrew and daniel connor from st kelder melvin australia i would have liked to have changed their names it is the right thing to do but i look at it this way even if i changed their names and their parents started watching my comedy they'd be like my word doesn't randy and steve sound like our kids didn't jim grow up with a lot of people with muscular dystrophy so i sat there with the hooker and i said how much for the half hour and she said 180 and i said i'll give you 250 because i realized this is a specialty thing you're doing and she goes i got one question for you and i said shoot and she went is he mentally retarded and i went oh yeah that's what i do i find mentally retarded people and take them to prostitutes i'll be masturbating in the corner he doesn't even know he's here and she went okay then but if there's two of you will know he's not mentally retarded it's his choice to come here there's a good chance he'll die and she went what am i meant to do with him and i went i don't know i've never been a hooker but i'm thinking give him a bit of a show dance around a bit rub your tits in his face then suck him off but don't sit on him or fuck him it'll kill him so we go after the room which thank god was on the first floor and me and andrew look at dan like two proud parents watching our child go to school for the first time and then we leave and as we proceed to leave a pat andrew in the back and i said andrew you've been a good brother today he said thanks mate and then we had a hug and then we had that moment after a hug that Australian men have where we go i get out of it what's wrong with you and then i said hey andrew how does dan get his clothes off and andrew went fuck and we went back in andrew looks him up and down he turns to me and goes look he's very fragile i know how he likes to be picked up i'll lift him up you take his pants off andrew gets behind lifts him up by his armpits like i couldn't have figured out their magical hold i'm on my knees taking dan's tracksuit pants off he always wore tracksuit pants never got into fashion and as i'm taking his tracksuit pants off what many of you are wondering is can dan get norection and the answer is yes even though none of the muscles in his body work the cock is not a muscle the cock is a bit of skin that fills with blood if he gets aroused up here blood rush to there now what nobody knew about this 32 year old virgin is that dan's packin heat i'm talking nine and a half inches of disabled misery this cock's so fucking big i think that's why the rest of his muscles didn't work i take the pants off this thing springs up and hits me in the mouth and the hooker goes let's do the light let's explain the light when they legalize prostitution in Australia they didn't legalize it in all forms for instance you cannot get a street walking hooker you're not going to prostitute to your hotel room you can only go to a brothel in a safe environment where they have security for the girls in case a man shows up being drunk and dickhead or whatever and also it's safer for the people who go to brothels because the girls get tested for stds every month so arguably you're better off in Australia fucking a prostitute than picking up a girl in a bar but i'm not going to have that conversation again oh my you try explaining that to a girlfriend it's a fucking minefield but also they make it safer for the girls if you're a guy who goes to a prostitute you have to undergo the light let's explain the light it's very simple it sounds like what it is you put your cock under a very bright light and they look around the shaft to see if there's anything untoward then they get a magnifying glass out go through your pubes to make sure nothing's running around it's not a big deal i've been rejected heaps of time now the chair's here there's a bed here there's a hot tub there the lights over there now we try to get the chair past the bed in the hot tub but we can't get it through so me and andrew walk over the hook and we're whispering because we don't want Dan to hear we're like um we can't do the light thing and she goes if you don't do the light i'm not doing it and me and andrew went come on he's a virgin what's the worst that can happen and she whispered actually i'm more concerned about its cleanliness and then his brother andrew said loudly and proudly i washed it before we came out now you may think you're a good brother good sister good mother good daughter whatever the fuck you think you are in this world but you're nothing until you've washed your disabled brother's cock to take him to a prostitute that is love ladies and gentlemen tangible fucking love so we looked at dan everyone agreed it was time to go so we looked at dan me and andrew looked at him and went we're going now mate if you've got anything you want to say to us say it now because uh we're we're we're gonna leave right and this is what dan did and so me and andrew went back down to the bar and we hanged out with the hookers there's like 10 of them sort of mulling around yeah we're standing there we don't know what dan's up to but we're standing around the bar with all the hookers and then five guys from london walk into the bar who are obviously out of their fucking skulls on coke now if you've never taken a lot of coke then i've if anyone's gotten easier if you've never taken a coke you know when like five or six guys get together and take coke on like a Tuesday there comes a point in about six in the morning when we go well you better call up some chicks uh maybe and you call up ex-girlfriends like bring some friends bring some friends and i don't know what you're expecting so basically these i think it was a wednesday we did this and i think these guys have been on coke or night and they've obviously gone oh okay let's go down the brothel go down the brothel be a funnel go down brother and i'm standing at the bar chatting with all the hookers and these five guys from london walk in and one of them recognizes me and goes jim fucking jeffries jim fucking jeffries oh no you mate i know you the comedian the spaz approved guy spaz the comedian and i went hey how you doing man he goes hey jim jim jim jim jim jim want to learn a coke and i went yes and i went up to the i went up to the toilet and did a lot of coke and i come back out and obviously i've left andrew alone for too long and he was sort of panicking all by himself and i sort of walk in like what's wrong and he goes what if we've done the wrong thing here what if he's in there dying right now what if he stopped fucking breathing or what the fuck he's heart stopped what the fuck are we meant to do i said uh not a problem not a problem um i'll resuscitate him and he said do you know how to do that i said no i don't but how hard can it be push push blow blow i haven't embellished that in the slightest that's the exact thing i said to him push push blow blow then the prostitute walks back in the room he was with dan so i'm standing with the five coke fiends ten prostitutes she walks in the room it's like that moment in a movie where the needle on the record just sort of goes and everything stopped and she walked in and she said well it's over and me and andrew and unison went is he dead and her exact words were oh i didn't check that so me andrew the five coke fiends the ten hookers we all run to the room now he's not dead his chair's back in the upright position his cock is still sitting up majestically covered in jizz and spit but for a man who an hour ago couldn't lift his eyelids he was sitting there like this now you might be wondering why his eyelids are up like that let me explain something it wasn't through happiness tell you something about yourself i'm 33 years old i've been masturbating since i was 10 years old and in that time i have not missed a day every single day i masturbate haven't missed a fucking day every day i'm in a hotel room with a laptop way high up on my chest here so i don't have to look at the filth i'm doing to myself so i'm watching porn here and nine times out of 10 i hit the apple sign right and i do this every single fucking day yet i would be mortified if any one of you was to ever see me doing this i would want to fucking kill myself and i do this every single fucking day now imagine if you've never ejaculated through the power of yourself you've never had another person do it you're 32 years old and for the first time you've shot a lot of fucking stale jizz all over the fucking room and you're sitting there with your cock out and 15 strangers walks in and you do not possess the power to put your cock away can you see how that might be a bit unhinging so we had to get him dressed quickly but he's come everywhere and this time i look him up and down and i turn to andrew and said andrew i don't give a fuck how fragile he is i'm taking the top half this time and we lifted him up and we put his pants on and we proceeded to leave the brothel now as we left the brothel i turned to dan i said dan i paid for a story please tell me what happened and he said well she danced around a bit rubbed a tits in my face and sucked me off which is what i asked her to do it's so nice to be a disabled sex puppeteer but but even even nicer than that i used to have a preconceived notion on what i thought about people such as prostitutes man but i was wrong that woman treated him with dignity and respect and made him feel like a sexual being for the only time in his life you can't put a price on that all right well 180 is the exact the exact figure then we go up front and we go to called taxi and the taxi driver who drives there is still sitting out the front in his car and he winds his window down and looks out and goes i'll drive you home for free i just need to know what happened thank you very much ladies and gentlemen"
