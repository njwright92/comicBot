        "transcript": "<s> It s a good day for comedy . Well , thank you so much for coming . I have fantastic news . I ve recently become a mother . Thank you . Thank you . Well , then my step kids , so they just appeared . I mean , who knew ? You know , when you fall in love with someone , I fell in love with someone who s divorced , so I call them my little refugees . Because they ve come from a conflict zone . I ve got two girls . I was so happy when I found out I had girls . So I started making a list of girly names . And then Kevin said to me , they re 12 and 15 years old . You can t rename them . I said , babe , their children are not boats . He s so superstitious . Stepkids are like rescue animals . Just say the new name as you look them in the eye . They catch on , you know , and they ve learned even faster when you train them with food . Well , the other day we were all going to go out and it was my treat . And the eldest , she paused me aside and she went , die . You do remember my real name . It s Ellie . And I went , yeah , yeah . But you re my child now . And I want to go to Nando s with C3PO . The little one , she doesn t make up fast , so I called her Keith . I love those two little girls . I love them as much as any mother loves her children every Sunday and Tuesday afternoon . I help them with their homework . Like they say things to me like , were you alive in World War II ? And I say , yeah , I was a captain on the long boats . We raided many of Saxon village , but thankfully our warriors went to Valhalla . I have no idea what happened in World War II . And now neither did they . And isn t that what family is about just passing ignorance down ? Kevin s absolutely gorgeous . You may or may not know he s a comedian . And when we met at work , did anybody else here fall in love with someone at work ? Okay , let me broaden that . Anybody else fucked a work colleague . There we go , you see . Well , that s why they give you stationery cupboards and disabled toilets . That s why it s so much more risky working in schools . Good , aren t you ? That s good . He is also in the films , Mike heaven . Oh yeah . Okay , he was a body double for Ray finds in the Harry Potter films . Yes , you are looking at a woman who has shan t Voldemort in the back of a Nissan micro . Bucket less , I know . I mean , which is black cats wizards ginger pussies ? We live together in Chessington . </s> <s> And people say , Chessington , you live in Voldemort . Right , they ll have to cut that . There you go . Oh , Chessington . You live in Chessington , world of adventures with Voldemort . And they go , no , I live in Chessington . And they say , but there s nothing else there . And they go , oh yeah , I do live in a giant teapot . Next to some fucking monkeys . No , you can t . I don t live in a giant teapot . But we do live in a ghost house . Well , that s what we tell people because the previous owner died in the lounge . Oh yeah , we call it our ironically titled Living Room . Please don t panic , we have redecorated . And further cleanse it , we ve had sex in that room . Yes , there s been no spiritual retribution . I did think I found some ectoplasm , but it turned around , Kevin had just spun around a bit quick . I was like , baby , you ve expelled him almost on the curtains again . I m not scared of ghosts . I don t know why I m scared of funfairs , oddly enough . But they re supposed to be terrifying . That s why the rides have things like Terminator and Hellraiser and Jeff D N Biber on the side . And they ve always got names , haven t they , like , the organ cutter and the thigh , slicer and tongue . Yeah , I saw one called , I did see one called the organ collector . And on the side was a spray painted montage of a completely privatised nature . That s political , that was good , isn t it ? Yeah , I read . You see , I prefer living next to a theme park , not a fun fair , because at least with a theme park , you can take legal action . There s something goes wrong . I mean , as we discovered , with those poor people who got in that rollercoaster crash last year , didn t we ? I mean , bless them . You ve got to be this tall to ride . You might be this tall when it finishes . Thank you . But at least they could take legal action . That is what I am saying , right ? Yeah , I mean , you can t take legal action with a fun fair . If you go on a ride at a fun fair , you have silently agreed to be financially robbed and sexually assaulted . That is how I lost my virginity . I went to a fun fair when I was 15 , insurable . And I went on the waltzes and my hymen was bashed out by a very unforgiving safety bar . I do miss Sherbourne a lot , because that s why I m from a rich and an endorsement . </s> <s> And tonight , I miss the most , catching a train . When you catch a train in Dorset , it s an event . Your whole family comes with you to the train station and you all go half an hour early so you can get a seat in the calf so you can have a cake and talk about where you re going . And you get a Dorset cappuccino and that s an instant white coffee with squirty cream on the top . And then the people on the next table , they say , where are you going to ? And you go , oh , I m going to London . And they go , oh , Sarah went to London , you should meet up . And then the train pulls in and the entire town of Sherbourne gets on the platform and the mayor s there . And they have a meat raffle . You get on the train , you put your suitcase in and then it slowly leaves and your mom pretends to run alongside away . You can buy it s lovely and it s suddenly around in nature . And it s great . And you talk to each other and you say , where are you going ? I m going here , I m going there and it s so exciting . I have one train that comes from London to Chessington now . They like to cancel it a lot . I don t hear people talking on it often . The one time I heard it was a family and I thought , oh , yay ! And this is the conversation . Oh , God , why are you kids always looking at your phones ? Nanna , if you re not fucking shut up , I m going to fucking slap you . I was like , oh , did we have a nice day at Chabington World of Sunburn ? Please don t panic , because the parents got involved , you know , mainly to restrain Nanna . She was serious about that fight . I knew she was when she flipped her sovereign rings to the inside . She started that fight . She was shaking and punching . It was like my hammer dally in a floral night . I miss nature . I do . I miss it a lot . I have to get it all now from documentaries . Does anybody see much of the penguins ? Oh , it was beautiful . There s all these penguins . Sorry to give away the plot . And they start off at point A and they go to point B . I don t know the difference between the two points . I ll be honest . They re all just IC , but at point B they all have kids . So I m assuming the schools are better . And they say they march , but they don t . They re penguins . Their top speed is sort of like a primary school sports day . They can t go like that . </s> <s> That s how I m penguin . Or they re like teenagers . They sort of go , oh god , I can t believe I got to go through this fucking ice every fucking year . Every fucking year , couple . Eight the beer , not children . And Morgan Freeman narrates it . And what puzzles me is that not all of them make it . Like , but they film it . And there s like a blizzard in March of the penguins . And one penguin looks the wrong way for 10 seconds . He gets separated from everyone else . And the camera looks at the group . And Morgan Freeman says , these are the lucky ones . Because they will survive the winter . Pan s to the lone penguin . But one of the members has got separated from the tribe . And now he begins his lonely walk to death . And I m watching this thinking , we ll tell him . Put down the camera . Just run over to the penguin . Hello , they re over there . They don t . Do you know what they do ? They pan back to create a panoramic shot . So you can see how large Antarctica is . And how tiny this one little penguin is . God , I can t even find everybody now . Like just dropping off to suicide . And then they say , these penguins are endangered . Oh , I wonder why . I wonder why . Maybe it s because you send psychotics to film them . Like instead of spending all that money on hiring a film crew and hiring the planes to fly them out and hiring Morgan Freeman , if you want to help the penguins , why don t you just hire them a fucking bus ? Why don t you just hire a bus to pick up all the penguins at point A and then drive them safely to point B ? We could play them a film like Happy Feet . Like according to my research , we shouldn t even drive them to point B . I don t think it s very good for them . I think we should drive them to Madagascar . They seem to thrive there . I love that . I love the blue planet . That was great . I love that one because David Attenborough has to whisper more than normal . Because he goes to the bottom of the scene . It s a little submersible . And he goes , these animals are so deep under our oceans . They have never seen daylight . Let s switch on our headlights . And then he just beams 8 million candles into a squid that s got eyes the size of dinner plates . And then he just drives around blinding them all going , these animals are endangered . And now , likely poached . Who wouldn t want a piece of butter toast right now ? Like , do you know what I learned from the blue planet ? The bottom of the scene is really dull . It is . It s really , that s just nothing there . Right ? Like , if you ve got a fish in a tank , you ll put a castle in it , wouldn t you ? You just scared the fish will get bored . But on the bottom of the scene , they ve got nothing . Nothing . I mean , I know people say you shouldn t litter . </s> <s> But next time my car breaks , I m going to roll it into the sea . I m going to hope it reaches those little guys . Why you saw how nuts they went for the Titanic ? When they found that thing , they were fish all over it . They re like , don t take away our playground . Like , the next time my car breaks , I m going to put some dead animals in the trunk . I m going to boot that thing off and pierge . You know what ? I ve sent down a theme park and a restaurant . Blue Planet , great , frozen planet , also very good . The one thing that got me about the frozen planet , did you see the scene with the baby seal ? There s a little baby seal and you make it onto a piece of ice and the killer whale spend about 40 minutes chasing him and then they rip him to shreds . As I was watching this , the one thing I thought was , Sir David Attenborough has such a lovely voice . I hope if I m ever in a snuff film . That man narrates it . Just for my mother s sake , she likes to watch my work . My mother fantasises about my death . Yeah , that was the end of that sentence . Well , it s just if I don t call her quite frequently , whenever she picks up the phone , she goes , oh , so you re not dead . And I go , well , no mom , I ve been busy and then she ll tell me how she thought I died . She ll be like , I thought you ve been hit over the head by heroin junkies and you were rotting dead in a ditch . It s like , no , mommy , I m in London . There aren t any ditches . But the weird thing is , is that I always have a violent death and I always end up in a ditch . Like , that s her aspiration for me . And my favourite one , she once said , I thought you ve been hijacked , the sound she s down . Hijacked by human traffickers sold into the slave trade , they got bored of your whining . And you were rotting dead in a ditch somewhere . I like that because like a gang of human traffickers are going to look at my 30 something year old body and get that s got market value . Do you know what , Pete ? I don t know why we were ever bucking about in Portugal , nicking little blankets . Can I tell you something , the media coverage from that gig alone affected our bottom line . Our buyers have moved with the times , Pete . You know what , Sim right now ? Vintage . We want to get something that looks distressed . </s> <s> My dad now talks to me in rhyming slang , say , living London . But it s not real rhyming slang . It s slang he s made up . He said , do you want anything ? I ve got to go to Sodom . When you re going where ? You went Sodom , Sodom and Gamora , Marx and Spencer . That s not the rhyming slang for Marx . That s the town in the Bible that God destroyed . Well , they should have stuck to making trifle . Like , now because I ve spent some time away from my parents , I can really see how bonkers my mom is too . It s really great . Like I asked the very simple question , what s for dinner please ? And my mom literally went , well , it could be chicken , it could be beef , it could be fish , it could be peas . And then dad went , oh , it s Joayne . He went , Joayne , he was in the Westerns . Anybody ? Anybody ? That s what I said . Spaghetti . Spaghetti Western . He went , no , you stupid girl , lasagna . Mom s still dancing . It could be fish , it could be peas , it could be curry , it is lasagna . She tells my dad that men are flirting with her when they re not because she wants to keep him interested in on his toes . Like , we went to the football and she went , oh , Desmond , that player is looking at me . Desmond , that 22 year old player from France , the one with the noise bottom , he is looking right at me . And my dad responded to Sunny Man who s been married for 40 years , might respond with , what are you talking about now , you mad bitch ? Desmond , don t be silly , he s looking at me . I think he wants to take me in the corner . Maybe I should go over and play with his balls . Yeah , she s that man . I like , I asked her to teach me how to sew , but I didn t realize that when your bonkers , your teaching method is mystery and sarcasm . Like , I said , have I done this right ? And she went , well , I don t know , have you . Have I ? She went , don t be a slatter , read the pattern . I used to watch an advert on television , it was for Oxfam and it said , give a man a fish , your feed him for a day . Teach a man to fish , he will feed himself for a lifetime . I used to watch that advert thinking , no , if my mum s teaching him to fish , then you ve just got a really awkward conversation next to a river in Kenya . </s> <s> This is poor man , just going , Missy Spencer , I appreciate all of this equipment from the people of Oxfam , but you need to teach me how to use it . When the river is flowing , you better get going . Missy Spencer , perhaps we could talk about casting off . Desmond , he s waving his rudder at me . Desmond , he s really mean . It s going to get fishy in here , Desmond , Desmond . You re a bitch . I love living in London as well , because now I ve got international friends . Check me out , thank you , yes . I have a Russian friend and you have to forgive what she says , because she s Russian . She s not rude , she s Russian . Like , okay , you ve got Russian friends , good , you get that . Like , we were having a drink and she went , Diane , you need to lose weight . You are slim , but you are not Russian slim . I went , no , but I am English polite . And then she went , look , I am your friend , I help you . What do you need to do ? This is the name of the drug you are going to buy . This is the name of the pharmacy . Now , the pharmacy is Polish , they cannot take any credit cards , you need to take cash , and it is behind the back of the other shops . There is no sign . So , I m not just going to cut out toast . I m going straight to breaking bad on this one . And she went , oh Diane , you are beyond toast . And she went , okay , now when you take this drug , you will get non nutritional benefit from your food , so you might lose a little color . I don t know if you ve noticed , mate , I m ginger . My foundation shade is already magnolia . Like , there s only one reason any of you can see my face this evening , and that s because I ve colored bits of it in . If I don t color bits of my face in , there s nothing there . Like , if I talk to you , I m literally just white noise . That s it . And she went , you need to also buy sanitary towel or adult nape , because you will not be able to make the faces , so you ll lick shit from your asshole all the time . But this is very good leakage . So you cough , you lick shit , you laugh , you lick shit , you walk , you lick shit . You ll take this drug for six weeks . Six weeks , you re saying , you should wear , you ll take this drug for eight weeks . And then you ll be Russian slum . I was like , oh , what a miracle pill is this ? </s> <s> I said , whatever English person says when they get insulted , I went , aw , thanks . And I thought , I ve got no interest in doing this absolutely at all . And I thought , well , what will my other friends say ? Well , they re kind of like , oh my god , have you seen Diane ? She has pale , but she s like , she s super pale . Mate , that s not the problem . She stinks of shit . I went in a changing room with her . She s wearing a nappy . She looks like Gollum . Her hair s falling out , her teeth s falling out . Like , is this drug just polonium ? I think I ve seen the end result of Russian slum . That guy in the newspaper just lying at Amai on the cheerleading team yet . Like , yeah , stop booting . I assume the rest of the sentence was , the food in my mouth . Like , I don t know . So I just went , nah , I m fine . And she said , okay . But I have seen you least some matter of fine . You like treats , you like chocolates and biscuits . You re always eating treats . Treats , treats , treats , treats . You are lucky , you are a human . You d be a very fat dog . I said , mate , I ll be honest with you . This kind of conversation doesn t usually travel well in England . So I m going to tell it to a roomful of people . And she went , okay , well , fine . But make sure you ll tell the joke the right way round for once . So I said , okay , well , how would you tell this joke ? And so this time my friend would tell the joke . She went , okay . Tour women got in Tour Bar . One is Russian slum . The other is English slum . The Russian slum one , she met it s a very rich man . He bites her yacht and many blinks . The fat one dies alone in wet up sports . You see Diane , it s funny because it s true . I think people are a bit obsessed , aren t they ? Like , I went into a shop . I went into top shop to buy jeans , right ? And all of the jeans , all the styles of jeans were like slim , super slum , skinny , cling film . Like the only pair of jeans that had nothing to do with your size . Do you know what they called it ? Mom . Mom , I was like , have you ever at least got stepmom ? Something a little bit filthier for the weekends , maybe . And all of the clothes were ripped . That s what I couldn t understand . Like , the tops were ripped here and they had burn marks . And I just said to the assistant , everything s ripped . </s> <s> And she went , yeah , yeah . Well , you know Kanye West . Did he do this ? She went thought of , yeah . Well , he did a collection of anti dazz called users . And that s what we re taking off of . And it s all like Ritt and Burn and Post are croppily . I m sorry , it s what ? Oh , post are croppily . It s like the end of the world , yeah , the acropolis . And I was like , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . It looks very greasy . This is exactly how I imagined Athens looked right after the bailout . She gave me a pair of jeans and I think they were elasticated with cheese wire . Because they really cut in . And they cut in in the middle of my two hips . Because I ve got two hips . I ve got the one up there and the one down there in the No Man s Land in the middle . And they cut in because they were low rise . I had a muffin over the top and I had a muffin wrapped up for later . I had four muffins . I felt like I was on sale at Greg s . And the worst part was there was a rip in the front of these jeans . And my skin was rising out of the rip . I can only describe it , not that you would , but imagine if you farted in some cream . And I just looked awful and the woman went , yeah , yeah , definitely get them . And I was like , no , they re horrid . She went , yeah , but they re in . And I was like , yes , but I m not in them . I look like I ve been ridden over by the four horsemen of the Acropolis . I decided that that point I was going to try and learn to sew and make my own clothes . I watched the Great British Sewing Bee and that gave me inspiration . On the Great British Sewing Bee , they can make a top in two hours . I can t buy a top in two hours . I spend the first two hours trying to work out what size I am in each shop . Because none of them are the same . Like , I go into Marxist fences . I m a ten . I went into all saints . I m a 16 to 18 . I don t know what the fuck happened . All I did was walk 50 feet down my high street . And I didn t even have any treats . Because I m a good dog . Great British Sewing Bee , didn t it be watch it ? Okay , now you see there s like a few like , yeah , yeah , it was . . . </s> <s> The reason why I m not many people watched it was a little bit dull , little bit toy . I think they should remake that program in a country with no labour laws . I think it would be a much more exciting program . Wouldn t it , wouldn t you tune in for the Great Bangladesh Sewing Bee ? Well , in the Great British Sewing Bee you had eight people and they made a child s cape and then they had a bum . How British . Bit dull . In the Great Bangladesh Sewing Bee , there s two hundred people . They ve got to make the entire Chinom catalogue before the floor collapses . You watch that one , you , yeah . Much more exciting . So I was learning to sew . Can I tell you something ? I m so slow at sewing . I m so slow . I can t make anything in any reasonable amount of time . I m like those cyclists in France . Three days of blood , sweat and tears . I might get a jersey . I ll definitely get needle marks . Really ? I still wear my own clothes out . Like Kevin and I , we had a gig together in my favourite place . So I wore one of my own dresses . Can I tell you something ? When you make your own clothes , you don t know how to wash them . That labels missing . I thought I d made three dresses . I washed them . I d made one dress , one tunic , and a pile of rags that we now use for the painting . But I thought I ll wear the dress out , right ? So Kevin and I , we had a gig together in it . It was in my favourite garden , which is a garden on top of a skyscraper called the Walkie Talkie . It s beautiful . You get panoramic fuses of London . You ve never been , you know , do go . Because the other place you could get panoramic fuses of London , up the shard . Don t do it . I mean , like , they charge you 30 pounds . 30 pounds to go up the shard . What I can t get about that is that for a start it s called shard , which is like , it sounds like shard , which is when you fart and shake those l . So it s already an unpleasant sounding thing . But then to go up the shard , it s just , I mean , it s very quid . You could go up me shard . Like , I m sure I heard a prostitute in Wayman say that . But my favourite skyscraper is the Walkie Talkie . And I don t know if you ve heard the news story , but it s absolutely , it s concave and covered in glass . So the first time the sun hit it , it focused the sun s rays into a laser . And melted a car on the street . I love things being set on fire . I mean , I don t know why we pay 30 million pounds to keep trident . </s> <s> We ve got enough curved glass in London . All we have to do is add a couple of mirrors . We could set fire to the moon . But we had a gig up there . And so I thought , where am I in my own dress ? Because I m in my favourite park and I m with my favourite man , right ? Train to Ron Strike . So we were late and it was a torrential downpour . So we were there huddling in the rain and I said to Kevin , oh God , this can t get any worse . Who s this gig for ? Anyone ? Bankers ? Now that s very bad . Because when bankers are in a crowd , you know instantly , because as a woman , when you walk on stage , they will go , AAY , the strippers here ! Get your tits out ! So first thing they say , and I ve learnt over the years to say , yes , I am a lady on stage . There s not going to be any music . I m not going to take my clothes off , but I will try to entertain you . Just with this pair of lips . And that joke has a 50 50 chance of working , depending on how much cocaine they ve had . I mean , they say that 11 of banknotes are tainted with cocaine . I can tell you where the other 89 of the cocaine is . It s up there , fucking nostrils . If you take a banker , put him in a plastic bubble , give him a shake , you ve got a life size snow globe . That s all I m saying . So I was like , oh shit , this gig s just got worse . By the time we got there , we were super , super late . And I was really panicking , and when you do badly at a gig , you say you re going to die . And I said to Kevin , I m just going to die . It s going to be horrible , and I m going to die in my favourite place . I don t think the building likes bankers either , because that card that it sought fire to , it was a Jaguar in part in the financial district . I think it belonged to a banker . And that building just went , you ve gambled with people savings for too long . And just shot it with its solar powered death ray . It s literally the people s eco warrior . So I was like , I think I m going to die , Kevin . And he just went , no , it s going to be fine . Oh my god , because as we were drying , my homemade dress started to warp and rip and tear and come apart at the seams . </s> <s> And Kevin went , are you the Hulk ? You look like you re breaking out of your clothes . And I said , no , I can t help it . It s just what the fabric s doing . I m not that advanced . By the time we got up , I was in a foul mood . And he just went , they had calmed down . I went , no , I m going to fucking die in front of a bunch of bankers . And he went , look at this panoramic view . I went , oh , fuck the view , I m going to die . And you can t even bury me , because there are no ditches . And that s where I m heading in life . He went , sit down . He went , you fucking sit down . And he went , oh , there is no gig . And he reached into his pocket , pulled out a ring box , and got down on one knee . And I was like , oh , this is my favorite place . He s like , oh , this is the most beautiful moment of my life . And I m ruining it with my winy personality . And I just , he went , hey , I m Spencer , will you marry me ? I went , yes , I will . Can I just ask , there s no gig , right ? And he was like , yes , there s no gig . And I said , does that mean I m not going to get the money ? Okay , yeah , we won t talk about that . Thank you , yay ! Oh , it s so magic . I didn t get the money . We had a lovely meal , and then at the end , we walked back along to the train station , and we thought we got to Waterloo , and all the trains were stopped . And we said , well , we need to get home . And the man went , where do you live ? And I said , we live in Chessington . And he went , okay , well , how can I put it ? The guards are on strike . They happen for three days . All of these commuters are paying extra every single year for an ever decreasing service . There is a little odd lady on platform eight , who I m worried is starting to fossilise under the pressure of the eight undra commuters around her . I ll be honest with you , it s chaos and misery everywhere . And at a time like this , you two want to go to a theme park . I want to ride the monorail . We got married in May . Yeah , it was lovely . Do you , Diane Spencer , take he who shall not be named ? But we should probably should for legal reasons . I think that s progress , because we got married in a non religious ceremony . Isn t that good ? I mean , you think about it . I am over 30 and I am a ginger woman . </s> <s> In the 1600s , I d have been burnt as a witch . In 2016 , I can marry Voldemort . That s progress , isn t it ? I didn t make my own dress . I got my dress made wherever all gets their dress made , China . Yeah . It was made by Chinese children , because they have such little fingers . Oh , don t worry , I did my ethical research . My Chinese kids were free range . Oh , am I too dark ? Don t worry , the kids were there and people said , are they going to be bridesmaids ? And I was like , no , they re so young and so pretty . I don t want them on my aisle or my special day . I don t want the direct comparison . I don t want them to . We go up in height , it ll look like the decay of women . We let the kids do the cake . We bought them a lovely cake and some sugary flowers and some sugary glue . We went , go for it . And on the day , the cake looked lovely . And I said , girls , fantastic job on the cake . And then 3PO , Fassia s ever went , yes , well , we did have some problems . Because the flowers didn t stick on with the edible blue . Okay , baby , while they are cutting up the cake , do you want to tell me what you use ? Keith trips in , when you were in pulp and saw we use Daddy s glue gun . Okay , baby . And then she went , yeah , but people don t eat wetting cake . Do they ? No , darling , not ours , they don t . No . My dad did the speeches and he did a joke in the speech , which was really nice . Because he said , we know that , darling , is going to change her name . She s going to have two names now , one professionally , one privately . Reminds me of her great granny , Elsie . Before she got married , she was Elsie Love . Then she got married to a man called All Cock . We re all waiting for it . I m waiting for him to double barrel . Please don t tell me I m related to Elsie Love s All Cock , please . And then he went , in the morning , she went from All Cock to Ad Cock . The whole room just saw one . And I went , that was a great joke , dad . And he went , yeah , it is , isn t it ? It went down very well at Irvingeral . I said to my dad , look , I m sorry , I m probably not going to have any organic children . </s> <s> And he went , oh , that s fine . Do you know what , you shouldn t have kids ? You shouldn t , medically speaking . I thought , well , he went , well , let s start your life . I never told you this . There were complications . At the very start , 97 chance you could have died . No . And he went , mmm , but lucky for you , the condom added tear . Ah ! And then my mum comes in . We call you the Holy Conception ! I think they wanted it on my birthday , to have a good product failure . I am , I do wonder about having children of my own , but I m not totally keen on it . I do wonder if the stepkits will come and visit me in the future , though . Do you know what I mean ? Like , heaven forbid something happens to Kevin . And then I m by myself . When their adults , will they come and see me ? Will I get a return on my investment ? Or will they go and hang out with their biological mother ? I wondered this once , because I saw an advert on the train for age UK . I had a little odd lady sat by herself , and it went , Marge is alone this Christmas . And I looked at Marge , and I thought , it s Marge s stepmom . It s this where I m heading , turkey dinner for one , and a later life modeling career . And then I looked at Marge , and I thought , she knew her , she looks really miserable . She looks like the kind of relative who makes you drive , so you can t drink . She looks like the kind of relative who just turns up and drinks all of your good wine , and never brings you a bottle . The kind of relative who just criticises the way you ve cooked everything , and then won t switch the teleophimist s marble , and then start saying racist things . She knew what I mean . I thought , I bet she s still got family , but I bet she s ruined a lot of Christmases . Fuck you , Marge . Hey , up , you fucking rot . I think these people have frunked on , we know that woman . That s your auntie , something like that . I could tell you no song one . My favourite mother in icon is Katie Price . I think she s great . Did you see that bit on loose women , where they were talking about bullying , and she had her son Harvey ? Okay , for those of you who haven t seen it , it was amazing . Because like , they re sat there , and Katie , they re talking about internet trolls . And Katie says , Harvey , what do we say to people ? I m Katie Price . </s> <s> What do we say to people Harvey , who are rude to Harvey on the internet , and Harvey sat there and he went , hello . And he s saying , oh , pop it . And then Katie went , no Harvey , I m Katie Price . No Harvey , what do we say Harvey ? When people are rude to Harvey , and then Harvey went , hello , you come . On live television . No one knew what to do , like , Piss Morgan nearly sobered up . It was amazing . But you all just go , ugh . And this one went , yes , well , we can see that this is a very serious topic . And then Katie said this . Harvey , Harvey , and the way she said it , you knew the rest of the sentence was , that s the word we use at home . And that s how I knew she s a brilliant mom . You know , every time somebody is there , she just defends him . And I love that . We already love Katie Price , me and the stepkids . Because we watched her program signed by Katie Price . Don t you see that ? Yeah , now you see , trying to find somebody who s seen that , it s like trying to find a fucking leprechaun . Katie Price , trying , Katie Price , interviewed people to be the next her . Yeah . It was described on IMDB as , no anything about this show , be the first to add the port , like , no one understood it . And she would interview people and she would set them challenges . One of my favorites was she made them send out a perfume . And they had to design it . And she had her perfume and she described it . It was all pink and night time in there with a wig . And she went , right , my perfume s called Dreams . That s cause , Un Katie Price , I m a dream . You could tell someone was off camera going . She went , right , everything s pink , that s because I m a girl , the perfume s for girls . Un Katie Price . She then actually went , the photos taken at night , that s because Dreams happen at night . Un Katie Price , like , I just think she s underutilised . Nevermind , so David Attenborough , I want Katie Price to narrate the frozen planet . The baby seals made it onto the ice . He s gonna die , that s killer whales are massive . Why are we dragging this out ? Un Katie Price . I wanted her to do the Olympics . I would have enjoyed it more . Like , we sat there , me and the kids just doing Katie Price narrates the Olympics . I mean , she wouldn t know anybody . </s> <s> Like , when you watch the Olympics , they always know who each person is and they have a fun little fact about them . Like , oh , this is Matarbe , he s a Pisces , he loves custard . But she wouldn t have known it , she d just been there again . Right , it s the men s 100 metres . Don t know him , don t know him , don t know him . And the baby with him , don t know him . That s his same bowl . Un Katie Price . I just like , that s why I love her . And I know she defended Harvey . I know the second that he got bullied , I know that she went . They re all Katz Harvey . Un Katie Price . Yeah , Un Katie Price . Now , you re Harvey Harvey . Un Katie Price . Un Katie Price . No , they can t see you re Harvey . They can t feel good . Yeah . She s better than my mate Lisa . My mate Lisa s horrible . She s got two children , she s got a beautiful little baby boy and a four year old girl called Satan . Oh , you know her . I went around to visit them , at least they were the beautiful little baby boy . And she stands up and she went , I m going to put him down . And I went , oh , don t , he s my favourite out of the two of them . I m going to put him to bed . You watch Sarah . I was like , oh , that s how it s pronounced . So me and Satan are sat there . And Satan is colouring on anything that s not the paper . So with all her mums , Jimmy , whatever . She s just scribbled on everything . And then she just throws down her crayon and goes , I want to go to the toilet ! I know . Okay , now I m a step parent . We don t absorb energy , we just pass it on . Like the Tai Chi of parenting . It s quite useful . Like if a child does something wrong , when someone comes up to you and goes , you re a little girl , just smash over my flower pots , you re allowed to go , whoa ! Here s the number of the woman you want to talk to . I d be careful , she s a little snappy . I want to go to the toilet ! So we went , okay , Lisa , Sarah wants to go to the toilet . Should we wait a minute ? Missy yells back , we ll take her to the toilet . So we walked to the bathroom and we stood at the door . There you go . And she went , I want to do a poo ! You may . But she didn t move . I was like , you re not a tube of toothpaste . I can t squeeze it out for you , pop it . </s> <s> And then she went , you have to hold my hand . Lisa ! I was like , just Lisa doing . Please , don t get me wrong . I ve never had a baby . But how long does it take to put a baby in a bed ? Surely you re done . And she went , yeah , I know . Hold her hand , would you ? Have you ever held a stranger s hand when they re taking a dump ? And your sober ? And they are staring at you like it s your fault . Like , I don t know what Lisa is feeding the child , but clearly it burns . Because the child made his own noises . She was going , hee hee ! Hee hee ! And she wouldn t stop staring at me . I was like , why do we have to make eye contact ? And I looked away and I can see a mirror . And I see her still staring at the back of my skull . And she s going , hee hee ! And then the smell hit me . And I was just like , oh , oh , oh ! Are you on slimming pills ? What are you eating ? Lisa is a fibber . That s why I don t like her . I do like her , but I don t . When she gave birth to the baby boy , that was the troublesome one . The second one , which is unusual , right ? And I went to see her afterwards . And she was there lying in hospital just holding herself and she went , I m going to fucking kill him . I went , who are you going to kill ? She went , my husband . I m going to kill him . I used to have three holes . Now I ve got one home . I ve been torn into just one wind sock . She said , my twerns on the floor . Twent is a dorset term . It s the bit of you between your funny and your bumble . Because if it twirt there , you d be in trouble . Lisa s in trouble . She went , my twent s on the floor . She went , promise me . She grabs me . She said , promise me you won t do this to yourself . And I m like , oh , I m promise . I m promise . A week later , we re in a pub . And there s all of us around . This couple of girly mates they re thinking about , giving birth , thinking about having kids . And they say to Lisa , what is it like to give birth ? And Lisa s there , make up done , hair done , glass of white orange . She went , well , I was in labor for 10 hours . But it was the most beautiful moment of my life . I said , you fucking liar . Tell them the rest . Come on , tell them what you told me . Tell them the thing about all your holes . Start telling them that . And she went , hmm . And I was like , yeah , that s why you had the all the trouble . </s> <s> If you re as tight lit down there as you are up there . And I wonder , poor little bastard , I had to claw his way out . Open your handbag , get out your twirt . I know that s where you keep it . I have the next one comes out of her mouth , lying little fibber . I really do . I have the next baby when it gets made , it goes , I can t go down there . I ll just fall out . And I hope it just climbs up her inside . She spends 10 hours going , ugh . Because then when we re at the bar a week later , she will not be able to lie . Because they ll sit there and they ll go , oh , what was it like ? What was it like giving birth ? Should I have a baby and little athlete there going , whoa . Open the labor for 10 hours . But you know , it was the most beautiful moment of my life . It s beautiful . This is the end of my life . She said , you should have your own children . I said , I can t , I have problems . I meant Satan . She went , we can fix your problems . We ve got IVF and I went , no , I can t . I have two households . Yeah , I don t have a funny . Two households . Don t tell Kevin , he eats out of one of them . She said to me , she said , you should have your own kids . And I said , no . And then she went , oh well , you ve got great practice . You know , because you ve got the stepkids , wonderful practice for when you have real kids . Oh , yeah , who cares , our 3PO and Kees Turnow . Do you know what , no , they re mine . Because one day , right , Chloe , that s Kees real name . So I do remember . Chloe s guinea pig died and they came round and Kevin had a gig , so he waved him off . And then I said , what do you want to do ? And Chloe went , oh , I forgot to tell dad . And then Ellie went , oh , is it still in your bag ? I reached down and Chloe pulls out a little plastic container with a dead guinea pig in it . I don t know how he died . I think he died running . He s like this . She went , that s pumpkin . And I went , oh , I m sorry . And she went , can we have a funeral ? And I said , of course we can . She went , I want to bury him in the garden . And then she went , um , can we do what you told us the Vikings do ? You want to put him on a little raft , push him out to see and set him on fire . And she went , yeah . How can you say she is not my child ? I said , of course we can . </s> <s> So we got some plastic water bottles . We made a little rough . And we wrapped them in tissue paper . And we put them on the top . And I said , now look , see , we ve got a little pond . We ve got a little pond out the back of the garden . And it s like , sort of this big . I didn t fancy taking it to the tent . Hello , officer . This is exactly what it looks like . We took it to the pond . And I said , now girls , I don t know what the combustible rate of a dead giddy pig is . So please don t expect pyrotechnics . And then , um , 3PO went , what about lighter fluid ? I thought you re a genius . And it was at the point where I was soaking the dead giddy pig and lighter fluid that I thought would a real parent have said no . I lit it . It was great . It does went like that . We were like , oh ! And it was wonderful because it burnt for a bit . I mean , the plastic water bottle , it kind of melted . It took on water . The whole thing dipped in . It was like , oh , it s gone . It was gone . It was gone . It was gone . It was gone . It was gone . It was gone . It took on water . The whole thing dipped . But then pumpkin slid off the top . But he floated . And he s still on fire . And we were like , go pumpkin , you re good niggered . And it was great . And I look at the kids . 3PO delighted . Over the moon . Keith , oh , wait a minute . She is happy , but her little face is flickering . And I suddenly realised maybe it s got a bit real for her because this was her giddy pig . And we ve just set him on fire . And I was like , oh , I don t want her to cry . This was supposed to be fun . And I said the only thing that I could think of to say in that fraction of a second . I just went , oh , the giddy pig . Some people think it s bowling giddy , but it s not that slow to rubbish . Pumpkin with the ginger giddy pig . He had a little mane . He looked like a lion . We ll miss him , but now he s dead and gone . But he s gone to heaven , yeah . And we all looked at each other . And as three , we all went unkay e prie . It s not exactly the Lord s Prayer or a family motto you should really have , but it ll do for us . I ve got a family tree now with my two little stepkids . They re my artificial branches . I m quite happy with that . And you know what ? I love being a mother because now I ve got opinions . </s> <s> Well , nobody cared about my opinion on education when I was a secondary schoolteacher . Now I m a mother . Oh , they listen . I think that we should teach sewing in schools . Yeah , yeah . And I think we should teach them when there s four . And the first thing they make is their own uniforms . Now , if you re a little bit worried about that , if you re thinking , die . I don t think that we should give four year old sisters and needles . Please don t worry . The kids in Bangladesh , they manage it . I m sure little Monti and John will be fine . What happens is they make their own uniforms . And the ones who finish early , they get to make coats . And they are the lucky ones because they will survive the winter . Thank you so much for coming to this and being a part of my special . My name is Diane Spencer . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you . </s>"

She sends me this porn like you have to watch it right now . You re going to love it . It s porn for women . It s literally just like sex from the woman s perspective . I m like , so what is it ? Just the camera looking out at the room ? The headboard zooming in and out of the headboard . Once in a while a pillow in your face saying , aww , this is so great . I think he s the one . Men are so gross . We don t even know how gross they are . Think about the grosses dude you would bang . Okay , you have them in your mind . It s pretty bad , right ?

We can see your face just going the bar . Did you want us to know that you re not an organ donor ? God , I haven t done anything I m supposed to do in my 30s .

Every girl I know has one night , usually in college , and she s like , oh . I know , it s right . Not too much consensual . I don t remember yelling , yes .

Like , I know what it is . You guys know what it is ? No . It s like from Finland or something . Plan B is the morning after pill . But you can take the night before if you re amped .

I am not fun . I have sex with people . I talk about sex on stage . This is my version of dirty talk . Twice a year . When I do that , I whisper something with half confidence that I don t mean . The other guy goes , what ? I go . That s it . It is over . Just tons of sexual bluffing . But we have to bluff a little . We have to figure orgasms once in a while . Women , we have to do that . But the only reason we do that is we love you . That s our sweet way of saying , you know , wrap it up . Right ? That s your Oscar playoff . Ender speech music . We re saying I love you . I m glad we did this . But storage wars is on in a minute . Get out of me . Faking an orgasm . It takes so much energy . It s like , why do we do it ? Maybe just hang in there . </s> <s> It gives a thing actually happens . Or you can do what I do . Now when I start dating someone , I just set up that I have these really lame orgasms . So they re super easy to fake . And I am dating right now . This is how many things I achieve . So hold on . It s over . So easy . You know , men fake orgasms . Did you guys know that ? I m sure everyone facts you to completion . You beautiful angels . But this botanian has experienced that . A guy faking an orgasm . It s so funny . I was seeing this guy and we were in New Orleans and we were wasted . Because that s what you do there . And we were having sex . And it was disgusting . It was just like two seals batting at each other . And just drunken hands . High fiving . It was awful . And he was obviously done with our shared experience . He faked an orgasm . And like , men , you re not allowed to fake it . You re not allowed . There s hard evidence if it doesn t happen . I m like , oh , do you come magic now ? Wow . Where is it ? You can t , especially if it s your girlfriend . Like , we know what the noise is you make . We don t know the faces you make . Because that s something you look at once by accident . It s like looking into the sun . Like , oh , never again . That is a one time kind of mistake . No . But we do . We know your noises . So this guy , we re having gross sex . And he lets out this fake weird noise he s never made before . Like , bing . Oh , my God . Is your dick haunted all of a sudden ? That s amazing . And an orgasm and a question mark . You re just not allowed to do that . The past summer , I dated a wrestler , which was like ludicrous for me . Because I just , I don t know that world . I didn t know how to talk to him . I was like , I m not a contest . He s like , what ? Who are you wrestling tonight stillborn ? He s like , that s not a name . I m like , okay . And we were just like way different in the bedroom , you know ? Like , different styles . His style was like really energetic and like moving around . And like , my style , like , what I like , I like to like , not like , I like to live in a room with my partner . So , he was always like doing a flora routine , and I was like , it s the morning main occurred . But , uh , but it was fun . </s> <s> I was finally sleeping with a guy who s in good shape .

But I hadn t encountered with a huge penis . Just like the biggest thing you can imagine . I really think of them now , like , as a , like , like , unicorns . You know ? I can theory you re like , yes , I was loved to have an encounter with a unicorn . Oh , my dad , a unicorn in the forest , yes . But if a unicorn were ever standing in front of you , you d be like , oh , God , you would run . You would run . You would be like , oh , it s just a horse with a weapon on its head . Just what a giant penis is . The only difference is unicorns are white . But what ? What ? What ? It s good . No , so I think they re unnecessary . They re , it s like a homerlimmo . You know , they look cool , but you can t park them anywhere . What s the point ? Right ? I went home this guy and , um , and he went down on me right away , because he was raised well . Uh , I m thinking like , got his mom s email . She needs a shout out . Uh , so he s having what I m assuming is the time of his life . And , uh , so he s doing that . And then he kind of gave up eventually , because he could see I was texting . Um , like , it s about you . So then he brings out his penis . He kind of presents it like , here it is . And I think he thought , because I m a substantial chick , that I was just going to be like , I don t know if I m saying , but I was like , mom ! It didn t even register as a cop . Like , it just looked like an animal had latched on . Like , wouldn t like , oh , I was like , we should call someone . It s like , where does that sleep in there ? Is there a stable , like , was that sleeping hay ? So , I wasn t excited at all . It was all fear . And then I was like , you should be excited right now . Like , I should have been taking Instagram pics with it , like , yeah ! Like , fun . Possible holiday photos , yeah . I was like , come on , bitch ! You played volleyball in high school . You did that 5K run , mostly walk once , and . . . And he was getting weirded out , because I was saying all this out loud . </s> <s> Um . . . No , so . . . I m like , right , I need to stop pretending like I m a hero . I m going to sleep with this guy . So I was like , do you have a condom ? And he was like , no . And I was like , wait , call me on my bluff . You know I don t care . I really take the wind out of your sails for a guy to be like , nope ! And you re like , all right . But Benny s not something really sweet . He was like , but I don t know if he s there anything . I was like , oh ! Do you have been reading my dream journal ? So . . . So then we tried to have sex . We tried . And it didn t work at all . It was just like , it wouldn t go in . It was like , knocking at the gate . The gate was like , mm hmm . It didn t work . It didn t fit .

So I had to come home all the time to Atlanta because I take care of my mother because that s what s going on . You know what I m saying ? So my mother think I don t do that . So I had to go to the grocery store all the time . You ll say , and Atlanta have a chain of grocery stores called Croco . Now , I don t know if you re all familiar with it . But Croco s is real big , you know what I m saying ? And then the Croco s in Atlanta , they had a lot of retarded kids , you know what I m saying ? And then I robber that , don t get me wrong . But I m just tired of messing with me every time I come in now . I walked in on day this little boy kept speaking to me for no reason . I walked in on what I said , hey , that s a hate .

So I tried to act like I didn t hear it . He thought , you heard me , fat boy . I know what you want . So cooking some potato chips and cakes . Oh , you re gonna go here and hold on , slow ass boy . But right behind him , hey , hey . I called my second getting mad and grabbed one of them . You ever grabbed a retarded child ? They re the strongest here , you hear me ? I grabbed him , he grabbed me back , I said , ah , I said somebody to get him , somebody to get him . Let it head to running me back . Come on , take me , come on now , come on now . So you let me go , I got to walk on with you boy , right there . Hey , hey . That s why I say anybody having a children ? Beat your children . Go home , wake them up , beat them . They have done something you don t know about . You do not have the reason with a child , you are the parent and what you say goes . Why , Veloa ? Who are making deals with your kids ? You do not have to make a deal with a child . My mom used to make a deal . She said , boy , cut the front yard when you get through to over get the back . And that s the goddamn deal . My mom and then play . I had one of the mom s he s a threat to you before you go anywhere , you know what I m talking about ? Yeah , Bruce , we go in the K Mart and don t ask me , but shut up . I got a K Mart , I see the Fiat Show , God , I want it so bad , I m looking at that one . My dad came right up calling , you see something you want ? He said , what is it ? He said , that Fiat Show , I see it , but Mama told me no ass off for shit . My dad said , one day I m , you try to get us both fucked up . So beat your children . And on the same token , get it on the stand of which kids . Don t tell your kids anything like , my aunt used to do me just get me out of his face . My aunt used to tell me anything just get me out of his face . I was seven years old , I was in a car , my aunt , we went on my under , come out and go through , I saw a person I had never seen before in my life . I told my aunt , I said , hey , he said , what ? I said , I just seen a little bit of boy man . </s> <s> He said , what ? I said , I just seen a little bit of boy man . He said , what the hell is a little bit of boy man ? I said , he s coming up the store right now . Mama said , man , that s a bitch . I said , what did he come from ? This man said , shalt dick . Here s how I seen a bitch like , hey , dad , I got a shalt dick . And here I m growing bleeding at the day , you know what I mean ? So get it on the stand of which kid . On the same token , you definitely gotta get on the stand . And you gotta get a one on one person relationship with your children . Because see if your child trust you , they ll tell you anything . You got to be at that one on one person relationship with your kids . Cause my kids are not really , really cool , right ? Let me tell you my 14 year son told me that day . He said , hey , dad , can I see something ? I said , man , what s up ? He said , man , this is been on my mind . I said , what is it ? I m thinking , it s all wrong . He said , man , don t you hate when you sit down and use the bathroom and your thing falling in water . I said , wait a minute , hold on , hold on , hold on . I said , you can t tell me you re digging the water . My dick , and he doesn t try to see . I m looking straight at him , I said , what , I know what you re talking about . Son , dick , me and the man , that can t be my real son . I know , but they don t make things like that no more . My grandmother had a dick didn t know . You know what I mean ? You know , old men get weird , old , you have to give him a bath . My grandmother took off a cold , we thought her room had to tell her . I was like , my dad , what the hell , what you doing ? We had to put a dick in the tub first . I asked , man . He said to the tub , yeah , I m fighting , knock off that with this mother . I m like , dad , where did I get that ? Can I have a bubble ? I don t want no money on that , let me get that dick off your lap . You know what ? And on the same token , women are smooth . And fellas , women do food around . But the reason I don t get caught because women play and stuff . And when a lot of fools around , the man lives across town and out of town . Because we miss with next door neighbor co workers . When did she farm now ? And one thing about a woman , you never catch it . If you do catch it , you re going to believe somebody told them . Because one thing about a woman , women have a plan . </s> <s> They didn t have a backup plan . They didn t have a backup plan , the black up , the backup plan . Women s shit is in order . Women are thinking about your sleep at night . That s why you can go to bed and wake up in three in the morning . And look at your woman , she s looking right at your hands . You be like , day or you eat with the sleep ? It s like , no , I m thinking about something . Women are smooth . That s why I got to have woman down with me . And woman got to be down with me . And I mean down with me , girls . That means if I go somewhere and we together , we get into a fight . That means we get into a fight . I don t need your holiday screen . I need you to get in the hand . Because if I get my ass whoop , when we get home , you get your ass whoop . That just how I go . You understand what I m saying ? Because one thing about women , they will help you to the cart and nurse you back to health . And in the back of her mind , you got your ass whoop . And they might not come up to six months to a year later , but it s gonna come up because women don t forget shit . You re gonna get all gonna home . You re like , girl , I beat your ass in . She s like , hold on , hold on , hold on . You re gonna book my ass , but you couldn t beat that dude ass at the club . You d be like , girl , shut up . I had on my dress shoe . A woman on snow , man . But women crazy , let me tell you something , man . You know me nuts to the ground eyebrows . I m a liar . I m gonna lay down . It s a lady next door to me , take a razor , right ? And she cut her eyebrow off . Did she take this thing like a magic marker ? You know what I m saying ? And she dropped something witty up here around her head . I walked that side . I thought she said it , so I said , huh ? She said , obviously , that s what I thought you mean ? I said , McGrath , I said , McWarton . She said , we re doing it . I said , we re doing it . I m stupid . Y all all right up there ? I got her . And if that was a limitation , I ma say this and I m a meaner . Four play is very , very important in a relationship . </s> <s> And a lot of you guys got four play mixed up . You think four play is something you do before sex . You think four play is filling on your girl , licking on a day and making love to her . Gentlemen , this is not four play . Four play is mental . It s done 24 hours a day dealing with your woman on the daily day . And if you do this four play like I tell you to do it , and when you do make love to her , it won t take her very long to come , because mentally , you re gonna be like , if you re gonna be like , you need to do it . And when you do make love to her , it won t take her very long to come , because mentally , she s already there . But you got to be consistent on a daily day basis . Four play can be numerous of things . This is a sign of four play . If you re a woman , take a shower , walk past your neck , tap that air . She gonna be number back up , but you better stop . If you re a woman in the kitchen cooking , walk up a high , and I ll give somebody에서는 like , hey , baby , you got a man , she like , shit , you don t know , you don t know . So this is four play . It keeps peace in the home . That s almost quite rejecting you . I m a cause of when you reject your woman , you lay it rules for another brother to get in there . Because it s the love things that women like . This is rejection . You working on your club , you re like , hey , baby , I m working on a club . I m sitting right now in the auto zone . I d be right back . She s like , can I ride ? God damn , I d be right back . That s rejection . You don t reject your rejection . You need to approach that totally different . You need to go at it like this . Hey , baby , I m working on a club here . I m running an auto zone . You want to ride with me ? She will be like , for real ? You like , matter of fact , go ahead and drive because I got all this all on me . So as you get on the passenger side , she will drive a side singing . We re going to auto zone . Because this is the love things women like . And one thing I learned about a woman , if a woman loved you , she would do anything . But you got to get it to that point . And a lot of you girls not giving up to that part because you never barmed with your woman . And a lot of you girls are not feeling me because you re dealing with four or five women . And if you re dealing with four or five women , I can show you four or five women that are lacking something . Because if you re doing a job right with one woman , you won t have time , but another God damn won t . </s> <s> You hear that ? You need to have your woman . Literally . Your woman should be crazy about you today as she was when she fell from at you . If you re a woman at home , you need to call . She need to drop the phone . Green . Hello ? This is my man . Hello . He has a bad . That s what your woman need to be . I got to help a woman help me do anything . I don t care what it is . I don t care . Help me do anything . If I got to do a drive by , you better be down with it . I want her to do this show . Give me the pills . Pull up , pull up . I got to pop , pop , pop . Come on , come on .

        "transcript": "<s> I m here at a hotel room in Rapid City , South Dakota . A crazy thing happened . I had a video , which I actually thought was just kind of a run of the mill hug we video . Go absolutely ape shit viral . 3 . 5 million views in three days . My name was the number one overall trending topic on Facebook . I head out to the Game of Thrones trailer and Donald Trump . I would like to see Donald Trump against a dragon . We ll get a bill to wall to keep out the dragons . That was a terrible impression . Any who crazy shit s been going on the last couple of weeks . And I m so sorry I didn t put a video up until now . I ve been adding new tour dates , doing bunch interviews , had a little bit of a fight with the fine brothers I won . And I ve been getting emails from everyone I ever went to high school with . But I wanted to make sure that I didn t neglect this channel . And most importantly , I wanted to thank all of you . My YouTube subscribers are the reason that clip my viral . So with absolute 100 sincerity , I say thank you . And because of that , I wanted to give you a full 45 minute show unedited , uncensored , for you to watch . Here s the thing . I don t want to give you my current 45 minute show because I m working on taping that for a television special . So what I did is I dug back into the archives and I found a set I did from October 2nd , 2009 . If you ve got my albums , it s somewhere between dark side of the room and pick your battles . There are some early versions of jokes on there . Some classics that I m super proud of . And about 10 minutes that I ve incredibly embarrassed by . But also , the first viral hecka clip I ever had . The one where the guy was trying to correct me into Celsius . That s from this show . And you ll get to see another two minutes or so where the guy comes up again at the end . Before I run the clip , a couple quick things . Just a few . One , I started a community on a new site called IMMZ . That s IMZY . You can join that community to interact with me and with other fans . And IMMZY is going to pick one member of my community and give them a free Xbox . I m going to be posting tons of new content on this channel . I ll continue to post ad lib circus . When hecklers do come , they will be part of Heckler Own . I m going to be posting more episodes of Fuck That Guy . I m going to resurrect a series I used to do called People Who Hate Me . </s> <s> And I m going to start a series called They Should Be More Famous , where I pick some of my favorite comedians that you don t know yet . And I show you a short clip . I m also going to be writing a book about parenting . If you want to know where I m touring , go to SteveHoffSitter . com . And you can click on the calendar and see all the upcoming dates . I m adding dates constantly . But here s what I have already . Sit type . Scottsdale , Arizona . Temecula and San Diego , California . Unkasville , Connecticut . Tampa , Miami , and Naples , Florida . Naples sounds like nipples . Merrillville and Indianapolis , Indiana . Louisville and Lexington , Kentucky . Baldwin , City , Kansas . Springlink , Dearborn , and Hamtram , Michigan . I definitely said that one wrong . Rochester and Minneapolis , Minnesota . Las Vegas and Reno , Nevada . Rochester , Yonkers , and Potsdam , New York . Toledo , Akron , and Dayton , Ohio . LaCross , Wisconsin . Where this video is filmed , Madison , Wisconsin . And if you re in California , I m still doing my weekly shows with the Latfactory . Wednesdays in Hollywood , Thursdays in Long Beach . I m also throwing out a bunch more first pitches this year . So come to a game , the Columbus Clippers , Fort Wayne Tin Caps , Bowling Green Hot Rods , Wisconsin Timber Rattlers , Lake County Captains , and the Chicago White Socks . Balance probably the coolest . I hope you enjoy this show . Complete with hilariously outdated 2009 references . And a completely unfair shot of Los Angeles , which is where I live now , and I actually love it . Madison . I like this town , man . I like this town a lot . It s a cool town . It s fun . It is progressive . I like it . I don t know if you know this about Madison . You re not close to shit . No . I put Madison into my quest . They told me to take a ride out of my driveway and go fuck myself . So I did . And I got here more relaxed . But my point . It was difficult to get here , especially once you get close to town , because every road is under construction at the same time . That s a good plan . Just fix it all at once . And by fix it , I mean leave it there . Because I say construction , but I don t have proof , because I didn t see him fix shit . I don t know . Maybe the plan is they just put orange cones down . Hope shit changes . Maybe that s the idea . Let s come back the next week . Move the cones over . Fucking hell , let s do it . They have signs up though . That s important . They have the signs up letting us know if we kill our injured construction worker will be fine to go to prison . Well , I can t possibly kill our injured construction worker , because none of them ever fucking shown up to work . You ever see one ? I ve never seen one . Five are here when I feel awful . </s> <s> If you re like , dude , I didn t even know you guys existed . I feel terrible . I just killed the last unicorn . This is bad . Before I get going here , uh , let me tell you this . You know that thing that they say in college classes or at orientation sometimes , like you re in like the professor will get all tough and be like , look to the left of you . Look to the right of you . One of the three of you will not be here when this is done . Well , my act is not for everyone . So let s go . Um , I actually always wondered if the domeschools like do they just be like , look to the left of you . Now look to the right of you . That makes three people . Just leave it at that . I curse a lot , Matt . Get that out of the way . I curse a great deal , Matt . If you re offended by that sort of thing , just remind yourself that you are a fucking adult . Let your mind catch up to your body because well sometimes growing adults can t take that . Like I couldn t curse on Ferguson . They told me they wouldn t air my set . I said , why not ? They said , well , what if a seven year old sees it ? Like , yeah , what if a seven year old sees me curse at one thirty in the morning on a Tuesday ? That s my fucking fault . Clearly . I sat that kid down , made him watch the show . I guess his parents couldn t have stopped me . Why ? Could his parents not ? I guess they had died . That s the only explanation I could think of . He had dead parents . He was watching the orphanage . That s the only conclusion I could come to . And then he should still go to sleep early . He s got sneakers to make in the morning . Anyway . I just don t understand . Like , my whole life I ve been told to not let words affect me . My mother always said , I bet you heard this too . Sticks and stones may break your bones , but words can never hurt you exactly . I disagree with that , though . I think words can hurt you if they re intended to hurt you . If you tease a kid enough , he ll snap . And that s how school shootings happen . Like , no one s ever shot up a school going , fucking sticks ! We d have turned on the news one day . I ve been stoned too many times ! Kid got teased and he snapped , but my mother always said , Steve , don t let words affect you . </s> <s> I said , okay , but don t tell me that with words . I m confused at your mixed messages . It s negative intent that affects people . That s why you should not be offended by anything that I say tonight , because these are jokes . I m trying to make you laugh . If you get offended by something I ve said , well , you re not thinking clearly . Because I m trying to make you laugh . If you disagree with something that s okay , move on to the next thing . Don t worry about it . Like , you get offended by a joke . That s like you step on someone s foot and they ll get all beefed up . Want to fight ? No ! I don t . I want you to have a smaller foot . And I want you to fight someone else s dumb as you . Maybe one of you will die and make the world a better place . I curse on TV and Canada . They let me do it there . Because it s not at the wrong time . It s not like they curse during children s programming or on the news or something . You know , like , how s the weather ? Fucking cold back to you ! You know that ? They d be right because it s Canada . It s fucking cold . I was in Winnipeg in January for two weeks because my agent is a dick . It was 60 degrees below zero . Not 16 . 60 below zero . You ever experience weather like that ? Where ? Lires . I don t mean like with the wind chill and your head stuck in the freezer section of the grocery store . It gets 40 below here , maybe even 50 below . It s never gotten 60 below because that s never happened in America . In the continental United States , it has never reached 60 below without wind chill . I know that because the coldest has ever been was 57 below and that was North Dakota . And nobody even knew . It was North Dakota . There was a thermometer in the field . My cow next to it going fuck like that s all it was . Because cows start to go and it gets that cold . I don t know if you know , but then you go in the house . 60 below that s extreme like 40 and 50 is bad . But 60 euro is at 92 less than freezing . If it warmed up by 92 degrees , it would only be freezing . How dumb is that that people willingly live in that place ? We were rooting for it to warm up to freeze . Hope it gets freezing outside that be warm . 60 degree , I call that religious weather . Because you walk outside , you go , oh my god , then you die and you meet him . </s> <s> And people are still shivering and smoking a cigarette though . 60 degrees below zero . People outdoors shivering , smoking a cigarette . I m like , that is amazing that the cigarette isn t even the health risk anymore . They d be healthier to stay inside and snort cocaine . That would have been a better idea . Because that s an indoor drug . I mean , you don t take cocaine outdoors and blow everywhere . You guys are a cocaine crowd . That s surprising in a recession . I guess in tough times you hold on to what s most important to you . What did you say ? Celcius . Celcius up there ? Well , yes , but I m not going to tell the joke in Celcius in America . Oh my god , I was driving and had to go so many meters . You guys understand , right ? Next joke I ll tell in French . Have about that , huh ? They d understand it and go back . Why not down here ? You want to translate the joke to the Celcius for our Canadian friends that clearly there are so many of them ? You mentioned Canada , one girl went , hee ! Now it s all . But thanks for pointing that out . There was a moment in his head where he s like , this is the right thing to say . Like before it came out , we all have thoughts . And most of us just kind of swat the thoughts back . We re like , no ! You get out of here , dumb thought . You d stay home . He s like , oh , dumb thought . Go , go play . Be free . So the answer , no , not Celcius is the answer . I know what that is in Celcius , 27 below . You re trying to figure out what it is . Good . Now , so are 200 other people . Glad I stopped telling jokes to figure out what that was in Celcius . How d that class go when they said , one of you will not be here . What is it ? I know how it went . I never finished . I told you , it s not for everyone . You know , I cursed once in a casino . That was weird . I was doing a gig in a casino once and I cursed and they freaked out there too . Which was weird . I cursed at this gig and this woman kicks her ball stool back all up set . Stop cursing them like , miss what s the issue . It s a comedy show where all adults here go , no , we re not . What ? What do you got like a reverse Gary Coleman ? A little frosted mini weak kid trapped inside . What do you , Benjamin Button ? What the fuck do you mean ? She goes , my four year old son is here . My four year old son is here . My four year old son is here . My four year old son is here in a bar at a casino . He s going to need to know the word fucked . </s> <s> Well , let s just teach a kid now before he learns it during employee training at the Walmart . Just , welcome to Walmart . I m fucked . Well , that s the whole phrase . It s got to be the whole phrase . That s on the book somewhere . You never hear the whole phrase . They don t even welcome you anymore . You walk into a Walmart . They don t say welcome to Walmart . They just go , eh , that s all they say . I say it right back . They go , eh , I go , eh , eh , eh . I keep going . It s a good time . You know how to try . I went to a Walmart once in Johnson City , Tennessee . You don t immediately know why that s funny . I ll explain . Johnson City is a small town in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee . Walmart here is fucked up . What s it like in Johnson City , Tennessee ? It s a small town . What s it like in Johnson City , Tennessee ? It s your own personal replace , believe it or not . That s what it s like . Just to see full of people who should not be alive . Like , behold the man with the sideways face . Woo ! And he s the manager . I love going to a Walmart . I don t shop there . I just go to make myself feel attractive . Are you kidding me ? If you re ever having a bad day walking to Walmart , immediately , oh my god , I m so hot . This place is awesome . I m shaped like a human . I only have two knees . This is the best . Someone always gets trampled at a Walmart , right ? Don t someone always get run over by people the day after . Thanks , you having ? That crazy day with all the sales and everybody rushes to the stores and they re like , oh my god , it s black Friday . And I m like , oh my god , it s white trash . Are you serious ? People rush to the stores and risk their lives and die . And then the paper calls it a tragedy . Maybe I m alone on this one . But if you wake up at three in the morning and spend seven hours saving 15 bucks on a DVD player , die because . . . You think we slowed down as a society that day ? You think we lost a scientist when that happened ? I think we lost a Walmart greeter on us day off . That s what we lost . Just riding the electronics aisle going , eat ! I will not feel bad for people who hurt themselves . I refuse to . Like that dude who was crossing the street in California here about this story . Santa Rosa , California dude who was crossing the street , he was text messaging , he wasn t paying attention , hit by a car . Now I heard the story , I thought it was funny . Then I found out he died and I thought it was hilarious . </s> <s> Because you know the person on the other end of that text message was pissed off , he wasn t responding , right ? You know that had to happen . It spends the whole day angry going , where are you ? And he s like , I m dead . Hello , hello . Happy face . How d the driver not see him ? How d he not see him ? He s got a blue glow on his face . He s text messaging in the dark , that s what happens . I know that because I m gonna stand up comedian . I see some US holes doing all the time . Texturing shows like it s not bothering everyone around you . There s a blue glow coming up on your face . Like I m not gonna notice just standing up here going , oh there s a smurf in the crowd . Put your phone away , live your life for an hour . How about that ? And then that made me think , maybe the driver did see him . Hit the fucking gas , maybe that happened , huh ? We ve all thought about it , we just don t do it because we want to stay in society or whatever . The driver probably didn t mean to him . Probably tried to swerve or honk or send him a quick text before , I don t know how . But the worst part of the story , the entire Verizon network just stood there and watched it happen . How bad is that ? Yeah , dude , the glass is just going , no , you can t hear anything now . Hey , this is a dead zone . Hey , check it out , dude , now your hands free . I lived out in California for a little while . I lived out there , lived in Los Angeles . Anyone ever live in LA ? What part ? Anon ? It s not in LA . In California , but it s like , it s close to LA . It s lived in LA for a little while . I was confused by that because it was like , when you first moved there , I was very confused by the answer . I was like , oh , living in LA , no . But yes , it was very , it was like , where are you from ? New York , what part ? Connecticut ? I was very confused . It s next door , but it s not the same . That s why they have different names . I don t see why you would say LA , though , because like , Orange County is nice in LA . I don t like it . I don t . LA , first of all , tons of bad neighborhoods . Terrible , terrible neighborhoods all over the place . I didn t realize how many bad neighborhoods until I was driving through the first time . And I realized that every other neighborhood is a click click neighborhood . I don t know what I mean . When you re driving through and you look around , you go , ah , click . </s> <s> You know what I m talking about ? Sometimes even if you don t have automatic doors , it s just instinct . You re just like , ah , click , click . Everybody s got a different threshold of what makes them click click a door . Everybody s got maybe there are rich people . Maybe you live in those mansions over by the lake , that beautiful stuff over there , and maybe you know , maybe you drive around , you go , ah , four bedroom houses click click . Like whatever . Whatever it is for you . I lived in West Hollywood , which I did not realize at the center of the film and TV industry . I got there , and the first night out , I was so naive . I was so naive . I meet this girl . I was like , hey , what do you do ? She goes , oh , I m an actress . Like , oh , that s awesome . I recognize you from anything . If I ve seen anything you ve done , she goes , no , you know , I ve never done stuff like that . Oh , God , that s cool . That s all right . Oh , but you do like theater . You do local stuff . That s so awesome . She goes , no , I ve never done stuff like that . But you re an actress . You got to act . What do you just go on auditions ? You hope your land works . She goes , yeah , I ve been on one of those . You ve been on one actress . And it won t audition you re an actress . She goes , yeah , what do you do ? I said , I m the mayor . Because I voted once , you dumb bitch . And clearly , that makes me the mayor of Los Angeles . Lion to a girl doesn t make me the mayor of Los Angeles . It makes me the governor of South Carolina . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Appreciate it . Thank you . Thank you . Preach it . Breath of the testify . The white people don t get what I meant . They re like two black people in the room going , ah , I got that joke . That was cool . That was good . I m kidding . There s no black people in the room . I m looking around for some black person that got offended . And I actually don t see any , are you fucking kidding ? Is this crowd whiter than a sail at Bedbet than beyond ? Like , what the fuck ? This is . . . Even they have a floral section . What the fuck was constant ? Seriously ? Holy shit . I ve used to a little bit more diversity , you know , from New York City . </s> <s> Like , I m used to things being a little bit more diverse . You re like , yeah , we got a lot of diversity . We got white people from Madison and white people from Milwaukee . White people from our player . Okay , man . Oh , man . No , you know what ? And here s the thing . Like , I m not saying that your racist just because you re white . That s . . . Keep in mind , that s not what I m saying . A lot of people think that because you mentioned race automatically , talk about races , and that s not true . I actually had a sweet mate in college that I used to mess with , because he thought everything was racist . Everything . Like , he s walking through the sweet one day and I m watching TV . And I go , yo , dude , those two black people on TV look exactly alike . And he goes , what the fuck , man ? I go , yo , I m watching Sister Sister relax . Okay . I tell you this , I missed one thing about Los Angeles . I missed one thing about living there . There was a homeless dude who lived out my corner dressed like Superman every day . Yeah , I shouldn t even call him homeless . That s kind of mean of me to say , I don t know his situation . He clearly lived on my corner . I guess he was ruthless is the right term , because home is where you make it . He made it right to fuck there . And . . . He wore a Superman outfit every single day . And I walked by him whenever I could , because that shit ll cheer you up . No matter what mood you re in when you see homeless Superman , your day got better . Like , oh , even Superman has bad luck . I guess his weaknesses are kryptonite and ambition . Don t act like I m the first to tease the homeless . We all tease the homeless . We have canned goods drives for the homeless . They don t own canned openers . Who fucks a homeless guy gonna do with a can ? Listen to it , shake it . Let s fucking . . . It s a can . Next week he s banging again . Like , oh , do you need food ? No , I have food . I need a fucking canned opener . And a stove , you prick . Homeless guy once gave me keys . That was a weird day . That ever happened to you . Homeless person gives you a set of keys . Throw me off for the whole day . I was like , what the fuck could this open ? Like , I don t . . . What are these keys to ? </s> <s> He goes , you and I are proud of a motorcycle . All you gotta do is find it . I m like , dude , this is the greatest game show I ve ever heard of , man . I m on homeless motorcycle with a good day . I got tired of lots of Angeles and Moody s . I moved to Jersey . I moved to Essex County , New Jersey , which is the county in Jersey with the highest taxes . Now here s the issue with that . The taxes pay for things like after school programs , like soccer , stuff like that . But I don t have any kids and I don t give a shit about yours . So . . . Why am I paying for other people s children to enjoy themselves ? So I protest that I did . I marched down to the City Councilman s office and I signed up for Little League . So I m gonna pay , I m gonna play . And . . . I m hitting 340 . Fuck those kids ! I mean , it s just a . . . That s stupid . You re 8 years old . I mean , I should be hitting higher than 340 . But . . . Jamie s got a curveball . Little bastards on steroids . Anyway . . . Glad you re with me on the sports show . It s difficult to do sports jokes as a comedian . Because no matter how big a sports fan , sports fans don t get each other s jokes . Like a basketball fan won t get a hockey joke . Hockey fan won t get a NASCAR joke . NASCAR fan won t get anything . So . . . That s tough to do . Oh , that s just a joke . NASCAR fans get plenty . They get fired from the pigly wiggly and . . . And they get pregnant at 15 and . . . And they get touched by their uncle Ennis . They get many , many things . Oh , what a stereotype . I don t know what their uncle s name is . It s probably Ennis , but we re a betting man . Here s what I moved . I moved because I bought a house with my girlfriend . That s what happened . We bought a house together . And then , thank you very much . And four and a half months later , we took the next step , which was to break up . Yeah , that s some shit , huh ? Yeah . I don t have a house with my ex girlfriend . And . . . No , it s not wonderful . That s the wrong . If you were to describe it , that would be the last word . Fucked up . That s a word I would use . Stupid , worst thing I ve ever done . All adjectives . I would use to describe this . And I told my father about this . And he tried to cheer me up . </s> <s> He goes , Steve , relax . It s okay . It s just a house . You ll get over it . Like , what do you mean I m going to get over it ? He goes , well , it s not permanent . I m like , how can you say that only a house with my ex girlfriend is not permanent ? He goes , at least you two didn t have a kid together . That would be a lot more permanent than a house . And I said , in this housing market ? You can t kill a house . I m not saying I would . I just never heard of a couple after prom putting a house in a dumpster . All I m saying is I want options . Really ? Really you re concerned for the welfare of my fictional child ? I wrote him . I made him up . I bet he d be fictionly adorable with the fuck cares . Kick her in the mouth face . Who cares ? He doesn t exist and never has . I ll kick his teeth out if I want to . And I should because if he s a baby , he shouldn t fucking have teeth . That s some creepy shit . Something s wrong with that baby . He s got a first head of teeth . You kick him in the teeth . You saw a baby with teeth . You kick him in the damn face too . Everyone of us be like , always shit it s a demon . Just kick him in . Go for a baby demon teeth . I ll tell you what , I ll rewind the story . And I will make everyone happy and raise my fictional child just for you . I will make sure that he s a productive member of society . And then one day he will cut you off in traffic and you want to fucking kill him . How about that , huh ? Now we re all on the same fictional page . Never be offended by a joke ever . It doesn t make sense . There s real shit in this world to be offended by . You want to be offended , pick your battles . There s genocide in Africa . The economy is crumbling . Paris Hilton got a record deal . There s real shit . I understand . I risk pushing people too far away if I get too dark or overtly sexual . I understand . Those are the two things that can mess with a comedy club crowd . I know that . It s hard to laugh at a good blowjob joke when the person you want one from is sitting next to you . I understand . That can be difficult unless I m helping . And it s like , I don t know maybe I can contribute to the blowjob for a capital ratio of Madison , Wisconsin . Maybe that ll help . Sell down , sir . I know comedy clubs are real big dayplaces though because women love to laugh . And a lot of guys aren t funny . So they take their day to a comedy club on the way home . </s> <s> They repeat my jokes . They get late . That shit s not fake . It s difficult to date though . It s very difficult to date because sexual harassment has gotten out of control . I m not saying we should sexually harass people . But like , let s separate the real shit from the fake shit . Like according to most college policies , I have sexually harassed every woman in this room by being born . I m sorry . Nothing I can do about it . My parents fuck nine months later shit happens . It is amazing how sensitive we ve gotten . And because of that , guys are afraid to be real in a relationship . Like even if we re making out with someone we re dating , we can t just like take things to the next level . We have to do that like little graze your boob accidentally move and then if you re okay with it , and we re like , ah , I got you . You have to do that like trying to swab one hand with a jeans . You don t want to talk about unbuttoned jeans with one hand while you re making out . You don t try to be all romantic . But then what if she wears a belt ? Fuck you wear a belt . How dare you ? I just crack open to save you put another fucking safe inside that s not fair . And we can t even just be like , hey , you want to go to your bed . No , we have to be all coy . We have to be like , oh , this couch is too thin for both of us . What do we do ? She s like , do you want to go to my bed ? You re like , oh my god , I didn t even know you owned a bed . That s so crazy . Why would you have a bed ? You re weird . And then once we re there , we re still not going to have sex . We re still not going to have sex because women think that if we have sex with them , that will lose respect for them . Which I don t understand . That happened to me . I went on three dates , like five , six hour marathon dates connected on every level with this girl . And then after the third date , we re hooking up and she stops and she goes , wait , we can t have sex . I know I want to , but we can t have sex . I m like , who the fuck s going to stop us ? Like is there a moment where it s like , please , no ! She s like , no , that s not what I mean . I mean , I want to have sex with you , but I just wouldn t , I don t think we should , because you ll lose respect for me . Like why would I lose respect for you if you make an adult decision and follow through on it ? I would gain respect for you . I don t understand the logic . She s like , no , if I have sex with a guy for the first three weeks , you ll automatically lose respect for me . I just , I don t want you to lose respect for me . </s> <s> So we re not going to have sex , so I don t lose respect for me . I m like , okay , but what if I lose interest ? Let s be adults for a second . Why can t we just make out for a couple of weeks ? Why can t you make your way to the fuck out the door ? I m an adult . Some guys were laughing . Some guys started laughing . Look at the date who s not laughing and went , shit , this is not going to end well . We re going to think that if they have sex with a guy , how automatically lose respect for them . Ladies , let me talk to you for a second . If a guy leaves because you had sex with him , let him leave . He s a dick . You don t want to date him . Why do you want to have like a stupid shitty three months relationship invest all that time in someone only to find out their dick afterward ? No , find out right the fuck away . What do you have a shitty three months relationship ? And you had to break up with him and then all your friends have talked to you about it and they find out because you have to update your status on Facebook and everyone s like , oh , I didn t like him in the first place . Like , it s fucking stupid . All I m saying is ladies , if you love something , fuck it and see what it does . Because you need to know if you re compatible with someone sexually if you re going to have a real relationship . Because what if you find out too late ? I was dating a girl for three and a half weeks before we slept together and there was the first time we had sex and the last time we had sex . Because it was the worst sex I ever had . It was the worst sex anyone s ever had . I don t care what drunken , sloppy , stumbling shit you ve been through . This would fucking win . I don t know if there s a contest I could enter it in , maybe a state fair somewhere has that category . I don t know , but I would get a blue ribbon for this bullshit . It was awful . She was lying down on top of me , lying down onto not sitting on me . That would make sense . No , lying down completely flush on top of me , trying to fuck me missionary . And I m sitting there going , honey , I don t have a hook . You need to know yourself sexually . You need to know your partner sexually . Like I can tell you this , I cannot dirty talk . I can t do it . If someone needs me to dirty talk , cannot be in a relationship with them . Because I have nothing . I can t do it . I can t , I ve tried . I can t do it . I ve got like three things I can go to . </s> <s> I ve got , oh baby , right there and . . . Yay ! Like that s all I got . Try that last one . It s fucking fun . You had at some point , just while you re having sex , it s going , yay ! To see what she does . You want a really freak rap ? Just go , give me ! And to see what happens . She ll stop , but you ll be laughing for hours . I was with a girl once who was really dirty , really quickly . And I did not know what to do . I was with a girl once who was really dirty , really quickly . And I did not know what to do . I was with a girl once who was really dirty , really quickly . I did not know what to do . I didn t know what to do . All we re doing is making out . We re just making out . And she just goes , I want you to fuck me in my pussy . And I m like , ooh ! I want to do that too ! Did you read my to do list ? Because that was all my to do list . It was , it was by groceries , fuck you , and you re pussy . And Tivo , the office . That was the three things I wanted to do . And I feel good about myself when I check things up . My to do list . I don t want to get too overtly sexual and risk losing the crowd . So here s , I ll go to something easier . Here s the funny thing about abortion . I m . . . And don t get offended simply by mentioning abortion . You have to realize abortion is part of our popular culture . It has something that happens . It has all around us . The plan B pill is available over the counter . That is how pervasive abortion is . You can buy the plan B pill the night before , which kind of makes it the plan A pill . I smell a new market in campaign . But check this out . Here s the weird part . I understand . We re talking about this because I m a comic , and we re talking about this . But I was once forced to a conversation about abortion at an office depot . That s a weird place to be . Because I was just . . . I was just . . . All right , I was checking out . I was trying to . . . I m on this long line . And these two dudes were pissed off that the line was taken too long . And , uh , like they were really upset . And they were like , we re like to our abortion protest . And I m like , my printer needs paper . Why are we discussing this ? But I was curious what goes into the protest . Because you know , I ve never looked in the basket . I was curious . So I looked in the basket , and there were sharpies and posterboard and glitter . </s> <s> Fucked up choice . Um . . . I was hoping that was for a side project . Like , that they just happened to see the glitter shelf and was like , ooh , we also need that . That they didn t like , go out and get that for the abortion protest . Because that s . . . You don t want to take a picture of a dead fetus and give it just hands ! Like , that s never . That s a tasteful thing to do . All right . These guys were dicks . They were dicks . Not because their politics disagreed with mine . They were dicks . Because they were mad that the line was taken too long . That s not my fault . I m in the line the same way they are . There s one dude at the front of the line who s taken all the time . And they kept just yammering at me . Like , it was my fault . And I couldn t take it . And after like 20 minutes of this , finally , I just turned to them and I said , you know , I bet if you got support of the abortion , this line could have been shorter . I told that story once in Hays , Kansas . I d have had better luck performing an actual abortion on stage . Just taking a volunteer from the crowd . Be like , does anyone have any pregnant women ? Now , who s got to fight a stares ? You know something like that ? I m actually convinced that abortions would never ever happen if fetuses were cuter . Think about it for a second . Fetuses kind of look creepy . Come on , tap borne fetus . That doesn t look like a baby . That looks like James Carville and E . T . had a kid . That s a fucked up looking thing . If you saw a fetus in the wild , you d kill it . Come on . Does a fetus in a field , you d take a couple shots at it before you figured out what it was . All right , I m alone on this one . Look to your left , look to your right , and now there are one of them with me . I don t know . All right , so we ll go to something easy . Religion . Actually , now I ll tell you this . What s amazing in me is how unwilling people are to talk in this country . It s okay if you re viewed as a child . You can have a conversation about it . We have actually built a society where we punish intelligent discourse . We make fun of people for being smart . We reward stupidity . Like , you ever get made fun of a classroom or work for knowing something ? Forgetting a question right ? Isn t that amazing ? That s so stupid . I get this question right , and it was an eighth grade , and that s stuck with me . How I got made fun of . Because I get this question right , this kid , you go , check out the smart kid . What a dumbass . You get it wrong . What a dumbass . Start practicing , buddy . </s> <s> Ready ? Welcome to Walmart . It s your turn . Kids just look to me and go , it s awesome . Be proud of your intelligence . Question everything . Question the world around you . Like the term redneck is not a badge of honor . That s a racial slur . At least it was . Now it s something people aspire to . I was in a gas station in Dallana , Georgia . They were playing Jesus country music . Now I never heard Jesus country before . I m a Jew from New York . No Jesus country in my life . Any other Jews here before I continue any Jews in the crowd ? Got a couple of Jews . And this dude pointed , thanks Judas , what the fuck was that ? You know what ? I bet there are more Jews here . We re just a quiet people . Because last time someone tried to round up all the Jews in a room , so she went down . So now we keep a little quiet . Oh , come on . German people know what I m talking about . Stay with me anyway . So I m in this gas station . They re playing Jesus country music . And if you ve never heard Jesus country , it s amazing . It s like , lost my dog and my girl too . Bad behavior . I thank God . I just still got my truck and my savior . And I saw something like that . That s how it ends . Now , I m listening to this . And I m going out of my mind . Right ? The gas station attendant sees this . He leans in with smelled great . And I ll never forget what he said to me . He looks at me and goes , you know Jesus was a redneck . Did I skip a page ? Where Jesus was in an earn heart . Jersey , did I miss ? Oh , right . Jesus was a redneck . The ninth commandment . That was not commit adultery . But if she s not marrying either down , like , no . Besides , we all know that Jesus was black . Just trying to scare the white people . Just want to see what would happen . Jesus wasn t black , but he was Middle Eastern . So suck on that . Jesus was from the Middle East . That makes him Middle Eastern . Try to have this conversation with the gentleman in Fort Wayne , Indiana . Didn t go smooth . No , I said , you know , Jesus was Middle Eastern . What ? No , he was Middle Eastern . He was from the Middle East . He was from heaven . Dude , I don t know if you read the second part of this book . Dude , I don t know if you read the second part of this story . </s> <s> But it said he lived on earth , and it wasn t in fucking Utah . He was Middle Eastern . He was white . How is he white , if he s from the Middle East ? There are a lot of white people in the Middle East . White people with blonde hair and blue eyes . I m like , yeah , soldiers in Anderson Cooper . What the fuck s your point ? The religion should not be altered to fit an agenda . Religion is deep and inner and spiritual and personal , unless you re Mel Gibson , because then it s a good way to sell film . But , oh , don t feel bad for Mel Gibson . He called the female cop sugar tits . What would Jesus do ? Not call it cop sugar tits , but sugar tits would make an excellent name for breakfast cereal . Are you with me ? Nothing to wake me up on a Saturday morning , like knowing there s a big bowl of sugar tits on my table . Just come barreling down the stairs . It s breakfast time ! The marketing rights itself , because it comes with milk . I ll be like , I ll take two cups , please . I push you back with religion , bring in with tits . That s my plan . I actually tell you this . This is how important religion is to America . The Bible was the most bought and sold book in America last year , as it is every year . But you know what Indu said to me ? You know number two was last year ? It was Harry Potter . Twilight was number three , which I ve never read Twilight , because I m literate . Oh my god . And if you are into that stuff , I don t mean to offend any of the women who want to fall in love with a vampire . Oh , they re so dreamy . Fucking stupid concept . All these little girls are like , oh my god , when I grow up , I m going to marry a vampire . No , no , you re not . Because even if they were real , they re supposed to hurt you . Like that s their thing . He s like , no , but he won t hurt me . He ll hurt everyone else , but me . Yeah , Rihanna said the same shit . Look what happened , alright ? Too soon . I like , no , never . That s fucking true . I ll tell you this , Harry Potter was number two . Bible was the most bought and sold book in America . Harry Potter was number two . That means a book where a boy magician defeats the evil lord of the underworld , sold better than Harry Potter . Takes a second , but it s fucking gold . Anyway . If you disagree , that s fine . You know what ? If you believe in a god that s fine , so do I . But if you believe in a god smart enough to build a world that can grow , you have to admit God would have to be smart enough to build a world that can change . The whole world is just a rough draft , and that way West Virginia is a typo . </s> <s> And soon as we get the Whiteout , we ll take care of it . We ll just Whiteout West Virginia , that s going to be hard to do . That s states been white for years , yeah . I get a hate mail sometimes . I get a piece of hate mail once called me the Antichrist , which is weird because it would make Christ the Antisteef . Not that important . I got a piece of Steve Yousuck , Scient Kyle Hofstetter . It s my last name . Like , mom , our cousins are dick . Like what , what , what , today ? But I googled him . I did . And we are not related . You should Google Kyle Hofstetter too . Because if you do , you will find a website that accuses him of satanizing Billy Goats . It s my website . I should tell you that . Thanks for writing , Kyle . How s the job interview going ? Hope they haven t Googled you . If you don t want to say me a hate mail , you enjoyed the show . I appreciate that . I ve got four different comedy albums with me . They re all material you did not hear tonight . Everyone of them is different from each other . If you want to pick them now , that s great . If you want to pick them more than one , I ll give you a break on them . But I got free shit for you too . You re already paid to see the show tonight . So I got posters and postcards and stickers . Those are all free . The stickers say Steve Hofstetter is my friend . They say that because I have half a million friends on Facebook and MySpace and Twitter . Well , I m not on MySpace anymore now . It s for homeless people . But if you re on Facebook or Twitter , that s cool . If you re not , if you don t have any of those , just have a happy 87th birthday . Because seriously , get with the program . It s the 90s . Come on . It s the 90s . And I know it s not the 90s . I m trying to fuck with the stone people . I want to see what it had . See if anyone s sitting there like , boo . I smoke myself back in time . Three more hits . This should be legal . Anyway . The way you get the free stuff is all I ask you . Sign up for my email list . That way you can find out the next time I m going to be in Madison . Which as it turns out , is 45 minutes from now . So . Hurry to fuck up . Anyway , sign up for the email list . But most of all , come over and say , hey , because I love talking to people after shows . I will stick around and I ll talk to everybody here because I think conversation is a form of education . </s> <s> And education is a solution to the stupidity in this country . It s not just about selling t shirts and CDs after a show . There s so many other forms of currency . There s smiles and handshakes and thank yous and standing ovation and parades and your daughter and whatever you have . Remainly your daughter . Now mainly conversation . Because conversation is a form of education and I really believe education is a solution to stupidity . I think we can get together . We can teach the smart people to kill the stupid people . I think we can do it . I believe the children are future . You re welcome . Glad no one s offended . I don t want to see anyone like , I don t want to die . It s so good for you . They re coming with me . If you guys agree with me , you should buy one of these after the show . It s pretty simple . It says , your stupidity offends me . Here s what you do . You buy one of these and then you buy running shoes because stupid people like to fight . I have a real solution for the stupidity in this country but they re never going to let me do it and it s going to come from the last place we d expect television . You know that show where you re smarter than a fifth grader ? You know that show ? I call it by its real name . To catch a predator . Here s what we do . We combine the two shows and have it as a predator smarter than a fifth grader . Or to catch a fifth grader . Whatever you want to call it . The point . Is you take a predator and you take a fifth grader and you ask them both a series of geography questions . And if the predator gets more right , he gets to keep the kid . And I know it s awful but everyone who sees us going to study , right ? We re going to be brilliant . Just memorize and stay capitals . Don t put me in the van . Don t put me in the van . Hell no , I m not tired . Don t put me in the van . You guys are sick but that s why we got along tonight . I enjoy myself tonight and I especially enjoyed myself because you guys weren t yelling weird shit at me . Which is good . I know I remember the South Seas Park . I was getting there . I was getting there . Later I m going to translate my act into kilometers . It s going to be good . The smart people joke I told you . Yes , I . You were trying to figure it out . Don t get smart . Fucker . I was born smart . I didn t try to do this . This is not . </s> <s> All right . This got weird . I was all wrapping up friendly and shit . That was about to actually compliment the guy for being able to take a joke but I can t now . It does take balls to take a joke . I understand . It s very difficult to take a joke . People get sensitive about that stuff now . We re friends . It s good . I m still playing on beat my ass . I ll tell you what . You can beat my ass if I put three jokes in front of me . Once you ve got gowns , one got leaders . You can tell me how many goes into it . How about that ? If you solved my little . You have to beat this whole room s ass . You want to get to me . Here s why you don t yell shit at a show because we are funnier than you . I don t mean to bruise egos . Everyone thinks they re funny . I understand that every guy especially . Every guy in this room is like , I m so much funny in that guy . And my dick is bigger too . For God s sake , I m six foot four . I m funny . Joke for the ladies . I told someone I was funnier than him wants and he got mad at me . He genuinely mad at me . He goes , you re not funnier than me . I m like , sir , I m a professional comedian . Clearly I m funnier than you . He goes , you re a douche . What a dumb thing for him to call me . I m a feminine hygiene product . I told him he was right . I am a douche because after I fucked his mom , she smelled better . Still think you re funny , little man ? And nobody here is offended . You re going to use that shit tomorrow . Next time someone calls you a douche , you re going to hope someone calls you a douche . You re going to go home and start doing douche peggy thing just to make it happen . And in case you can t get anyone to call you a douche and you want to use that joke , here s what you do . You get a t shirt that says , ask me why I m a douche . So . . . Madison , thank you for listening . You have a good night . </s>"

        "transcript": "<s> Thank you . Welcome to my half hour special . Do you know who I am ? Why did a bunch of people who don t know who I am show it my special ? That s bullshit . All right everybody . This would be fun . I used to live here in Los Angeles on Sierra Bonita . And I had an apartment and I had a neighbor and whenever he would knock on my wall , I knew he wanted me to turn my music down . And that made me angry because I like loud music . So when he knocked on the wall , I messed with his head . I d say , go around . I cannot open the wall . I don t know if you have a donut on the other side . But over here there s nothing . It s just flat . All right man , I gotta do a half hour . You gotta like me more than that . I can t be getting through a half hour with that kind of action . I like an escalator , man , because an escalator can never break . It can only become stairs . All right . There would never be an escalator temporarily out of order sign . Only an escalator temporarily stands . Sorry for the convenience . I m gonna take it out tonight , boy . I m gonna get loose . I m gonna get loose . I ran a lot of cars here because I go on the road . I ran cars . When I drive a rental car , I don t know what s going on with it , right ? So a lot of times I drive for 10 miles with the emergency brake on . That doesn t say a lot for me , but it really doesn t say a lot for the emergency brake . It s really not an emergency brake . It s an emergency . Make the car smell funny to never . You know , you can t please all the people all the time . And last night , all those people were at my show . To do this show , I had to take a physical to ask me a bunch of medical questions . And they were like , yes , no questions , but they were very strangely wordy . Like , have you ever tried sugar or PCP ? But I was standing up to meet . I got into comedy , which is weird , I don t know . But when you re in Hollywood , you re comedian , everybody wants to do other things . Besides comedy , they say , all right , you re a stand up comedian . Can you act ? Can you write ? Write us a script . They want me to do things that s related to comedy , but not comedy . This is as if I was a cook and I worked my ass off to become a good cook . They said , all right , you re a cook . Can you farm ? I planted a carrot once . But when you do comedy , you have to start strong and you have to finish strong . </s> <s> Those are the tricks , right ? You can t be like pancakes , all exciting at first , but then by the end , you re sick of them . I did comedy for a fundraiser once , we re trying to raise money to buy one of those machines and show us how much money has been raised . The sales are going all right , I get . I m trying to feel it out . I wanted my kennel holder , but the store didn t have one , so I got a cake . Man , you re going to get into my jokes harder . Don t be here . Don t be here . Don t be giving me that applause later . Who needs to get rolling with it ? I have 21 minutes left . And I have to slow down . I m going to rock the show now . I went to a concert in New York City where I lived . It was a heavy metal bag called Monster Magnet . They were heavy , boy . This thinger had no shirt on and leather pants , and he was playing like a flying V guitar . And he stood on the monitor and he yells at the crowd . He said , how many of you people feel like human beings tonight ? And then he said , how many of you people feel like animals ? And the thing is , everyone cheered after the animals park . But I cheered after the human beings park , because I did not know there was a second park to the question . I said , yes , I do feel like I m human . I do not feel like a tree . I do not have a girlfriend . I just know a girl who would get really mad if she heard me say that . And a pause break over my infidelity . I made a 4A test , my dad . I was very scared to get it . It does not matter what you have been doing . Waiting for the results is frightening . So I don t get the rank of an A test anymore . I get the round about A test . I call my friend Brian . I said , Brian , do you know anybody who has A ? No . Cool . Do you know me ? I got into an argument with a girlfriend inside of a tent . That s a bad place for an argument , because then I tried to walk out and slam the flat . How are you supposed to express your anger in this situation ? Zipper it up really quick . I got to walk around a little bit , listening up . That was just about the first part of my segment right there . I m going to go back here for a minute . Perhaps the show will work better if I m closer to the back . I m going to do an entire special not facing the camera . I m going to see how this plays . I like to drink before the show . I have a couple drinks before I go on stage . Every time people applaud , I m always going now . That s dumb . I imagine cool . He gets concerned . He says , Mitch , don t use liquor as a crush . I can t use liquor as a crush , because a crush helps me walk . </s> <s> Lickers have really screwed up the way I walk . And they like a crush . It s like a step I didn t see . But alcohol is because of disease . But it s like the other disease that you can get yelled at for having . I want to be a race car passenger . I m just a guy who bugs the drive . I m going to be a race car passenger . I m going to be a race car passenger . I m just a guy who bugs the drive . Same , man . Can I turn on the radio ? Use your slow down . What , we got to keep going in circles . Man , you really like time . I played golf . I m not good at golf . I never got good . I never got a one on one . But I did hit a guy . And that s way more satisfying . You re supposed to yell for . But I was too busy mom , man . There ain t no way that s going to hit him . I bought a donut and they gave me a receipt for the donut . I don t need a receipt for a donut . I ll just give you the money . You give me the donut . And the transaction . We don t need to bring ink and paper into this . I just cannot imagine a scenario where I had to prove that I bought a donut . Some skeptical friend . Don t even act like I didn t get that donut . I got the documentation right here . Oh , man . It s back home in the fire . Under the , we re done . We all know what the use . I m just trying to be pleasant on TV . My mom is watching . Later . I like baked potatoes , mate . I don t have a microwave oven . It tastes forever to cook a baked potato or an conventional oven . Sometimes I ll just throw one in there . I don t want one . By the time it s done , who knows ? I threw up a potato and we didn t go on vacation . My friend did this to me . My friend came up to me and said this . He said , hey , you know what I like ? Mass potatoes . So I do . You got to give me time to guess . If you re going to quiz me , you must put a pause in there . Sometimes I go like a craft fair . I see a jar of jelly beans . I guess how many jelly beans are in the jar . And you win a prize . Oh , come on , man . Let me just have some . I ll tell you what , you guess how many I want . </s> <s> If you said a handful , you are right . Listen up , everybody . Is this special ? Fuck . The Mitch Hemberg , not so special . Whenever I hang around a group of friends , I try to make sure we hang out clockwise . That way , if we re photographed , we are easy to identify . You didn t get that one ? You did it . I don t know why I do it . I just have this thing in me . They won t let me drop it . I have two sisters in one of his name , one in . If you ask one if I was weird , she d probably say , yeah , but pass backwards . She s weird . And she has like a husband and two children . And they have a family photo on top of their VCR . Well , they re all looking slightly to the left . And so something s going on over there . The camera is right in front of you . But I guess something happened to the left . That made everybody happy . And she said , my sister is cross eyed . So she can t quite pull it off . One is right on . I had a roommate s name as Eddie , and Eddie was slow on the mental draw . I was writing a letter I had to promise . And how do you abbreviate Arkansas ? You said , I don t know . Just start spelling it then quick . But we had to refrigerate it with the hard , boiled egg inside . After a few days of sales started to crack . And the first comment was , man , this guy is a survivor . Like you re walking on the street with Eddie and a car pulled up . You guys got out with ski masks and guns . And so getting the car , we re going to kidnap you . Eddie would have said , shotgun . I d have been in the back seat with the other kid , never . And he called it . Last time I called shotgun , we had rented a limo . So I fucked up . I was trying to be likeable up here now . I had to be likeable . It s not about likeability really . I was like a scene on a stand by the door . And a security guy came over and said , you re going to have to move . You re blocking the fire exit . As though there was a fire , I wasn t going to run . If you re flammable and have legs , you are never blocking the fire exit . I love the scene I like to gamble . Whenever they advertise , I can see a billboard . It s like a guy winning money . A guy holding bags with the money sign on him . But that s what happens at least . It s false advertising . </s> <s> Perhaps when they advertise a hamburger , they should show a guy choking . This is what happens once . I got my hair highlighted because I thought some strands were more important than others . I hate turkeys . If you go to the grocery store and you stand in front of the lunch means section for too long , you start to get pissed off at turkeys . You see like turkey ham , turkey bestowing , turkey baloney . Somebody needs to tell the turkeys , man , just be yourself . I already like it a little brother . You do not need to emulate the other animals . You got your own thing going . I used to draw you . If you had a couple of fingers missing , you would draw a screwed up turkey . That turkey was in an accident . If I had not a my fingers missing , I wouldn t type any slower . I type 101 words a minute but it s in my own language . I used to do drugs . I still do but I used to too . About once every three years I think about baloney , yo yo . I ll be at the store and I ll come upon the yo yo section . And I ll fantasize about mastering it to the point where it becomes a reference as to who I am . Do you know Mitch Heiber ? Is he that guy who kicks ass on the yo yo ? Yes I do . He is cool . I have a lot of bars when I want to roll . A lot of bars have black lights . When a bar has black lights , everybody looks very cool except for me . Because I was under the impression that the mustard stain came out . I m off stage . I don t talk very much . I m pretty quiet . I hang around people and talk . I can t get a word in edgewise . When I do , I usually say something like , hey man , you want some taffy ? You don t get that , Joey ? I got to get y all don t get half my shit . What s up with that ? Special . I m just trying to roll with it . I smoke cigars because I don t know a lot about cigars . I can t wait for cigars to start to make my holiday . What kind of cigars do you like ? It s a boys . I was at a bar and I was monitoring my own business and I was talking to me because I just did a show . I was gone by and thinking which is cool but it didn t apologize . It said move . I thought that was rude so I said go to hell . Then I started to run . He caught up with me . He had a mustache or goatee . A parent . He had a son of a licensed . His hair was in a ponytail and he was wearing a hat . He said , hey , you got a lot of nerve . I said , hey , you got a lot of cranium accessories . This is a smart crowd . When I put the dumb crowds , I had to say , you got a lot of shit on your head . I m going to get a little personal towards the last part of the scene . </s> <s> I m going to do it from a city position . I m going to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a When we were all asking , we were going to the woods , because when you re in the woods trip and there s less like a chance he d run through the thord and figure . But we ran into a bank . That was even more of a bus kill . My friend DeWayne was standing there raising his right hand , swearing to help prevent forest fires . We got him away from the bear . He put his arm around my shoulder . He said , bitch , smokey is way more intense in person . I went to England to tell jokes and I wanted to do my smokey to the bad joke in England . So I had to ask the English people that they know the smokey to bear was , but they don t . Because in England smokey to bear is not the forest fire prevention representative . </s> <s> They have smacking the frog . It s a lot like a bear , but it s a frog . I think that s a better system . I think we should adopt it . Because bears can be me . My frogs are always cool . I never has a better frog up and through me . And I thought , man , I better play dead . Here comes that frog . I ve never said here comes that frog . I ve got a horrifying manner . It s always like optimistic . Hey , here comes that frog . All right . Maybe he will settle near me . And I can pet him and put it in a man s jaw with a stick and a leaf to recreate what he s used to . Now , I certainly had to punch him holes in the lid because he s damn sure he used to bear . And then I can observe him . And he won t be doing much in his 16 ounce world . I like to talk about the differences between frogs and bears . I know it s cliche . Like when there s a frog around , I don t have to hang my sandwiches from a branch . A frog knows they are for me . He d rather have a fly . Because a fly zigzags . And my sandwiches do not . As I go like this . There ain t no frog attack prevention pamphlet . Now , if the frog is hopping towards you , do not look at amphibian in the eye . And then I just want to get inside him . I wear a V neck shirt . This is a V neck I got on . Next is so fragile , man . I can t wear a regular neck shirt or a herpes . And I especially hate turtle legs . I wear a turtle neck as I ve been strangled by a really weak guy . All day . If you wear a turtle neck and a backpack , it s like a weak midget trying to bring you down . I m at the animal special , man . My special , baby . I just don t know , you know , I don t get my special . See how happy I am ? It s taping a special . You know what I m going to arrest one on the weekends ? It gets busy , so they start awaiting lists . They start calling out names . They say like , do frame , party at two . Table ready for do frame , party at two . And if no one answers , they ll say the name again . Do frame , party at two . But they have no one answers . They ll just go right out to the next name . Bush , party at three . Yeah . But what happened to the do frames ? The do frames are in someone s trunk right now with duct tape over their mouth . And if you don t have a cell phone , you can see the do frames are in someone s trunk right now with duct tape over their mouth . </s> <s> And they re hungry . That s a double whammy . We need help . Bush , search party at three . You can eat once you find the do frames . I m actually into the normal . So I m going to show you a couple more jokes because man , you know , I felt this is how you are like seeing what the fuck s up with this guy . And I certainly want my spests to be funny . You know what I mean ? I come out here like , oh , I think I m rocking roll , I can bullshit . What the fuck man ? Let s keep the tape rolling . I m going to do a couple more . Just in case for editing . I think pizza hot is the cockiest pizza chain on the plate because pizza hot will accept all competitors coupons . That makes me wish I had my own pizza place . Mitch s Peter here . This week s coupon unlimited free pizza . Special note , coupon I m going to any of the Mitch s Peter locations . Free pizza oven with purchase . I ll a small coke . Two for Tuesday , but I want pizza to get one fresh hot as free . Hey man , I want to retake my special . I feel good now . This would be the second half . Remember I walked people trying to hand me out of flyers . When someone tries to hand me out of flyers kind of like they re saying here , you throw this away . You re just editing options . I said that Joe got another show earlier . I smile because I m happy . I want to put that part in right there . I can t floss my teeth man . I can t get into the flossing thing . People smoke cigarettes and say man you don t know how hard it is to quit smoking . Yes I do . It says highest is to start flossing . You seem jittery . Yeah , I m about to floss . I think Pringles initial intention was to make tennis balls . But on the day the rubber was supposed to show a big truckload of potatoes around . And Pringles is a layman coming . They said fucking cut them out . My old shit works better than my new shit . I am out of ideas . Sometimes I wait for people I don t know . It s very dangerous to wait in the sun . Because what if they don t have a hand ? They ll think you re cocky . Look at I got motherfuckin . This thing is useful . I m gonna go pick some up . I think you d like me more now than earlier . So I m gonna redo my special . I had a party in Los Angeles . And I had a neighbor . I m gonna redo my special . I m gonna redo it . I didn t say it really long hair . People always thought it was high on stage . Because people associate long hair with drug use . I wish long hair was associated with something other than drug use . Like an extreme longing for cake . And then strangers would see long hair guys . </s> <s> That guy eats cake . He is on bunk cake . Mother Santa , their daughters don t bring the cake either over here anymore . He smelled like flower . Did you see how excited he got when he found out your birthday was fast approaching ? I like cinnamon rolls . That s why I wish they made like a cinnamon roll incense . Because I don t always have time to make a pan . Perhaps I d rather let a stick . Then I had my roommates wake up with false hopes . That s you . You re gonna be edited in . That was pretty good reaction . I guess I got to end now . I don t know how to end this . Seriously , I just feel like doing another hour . The Mitch Hedby , not in many special . Self indulgence . Hey people . Look , you re alright . This is dumb . Hey man . How are you guys all sitting ? Hey man . I wrote a script and I gave it to a guy who reads scripts and he read it . And he said he really likes it . But he thinks I need to rewrite it . Then I ll just make a copy . I gotta get off this damn stage . I wish it was just like a chapter that would open up and I d fall in it . You are done . I m gonna get out of here man . This jacket is dry clean only . Which means it s dirty . Why like in my game better when the specialist over ? Let s do the B sides of the Mitch Hedby special . I played a guitar . I taught myself how to play the guitar which was a bad decision because I didn t know how to play it . So I was a shitty teacher . I would never have went to me . I played in the death metal band . People either loved us or they hated us or they thought we were okay . A lot of death metal bands have intense names like Rigor Mortis or Mortuary or Obituary . We weren t that intense . We just went with injured . Rigor Mortis changed it to Acapada as we were walking out of the pawn shop . We became a death metal barbershop quartet . You know what I mean ? People think that s dangerous but not me because humans are made out of 95 of water . So the audience is 5 away from a pool . I like kick cats unless I m with four or more people .

I m going to get a little bit of a ride . I m going to get a little bit of a ride . Hey , baby . Tell you doing . What ? Ron , you promised . I m going to get , when I m like , jammer and stuff . You know , that just makes me crazy sometimes . You know how I am . Kenhan , you have a show to do in four hours . Oh , baby , we re going to make it to that show . You don t worry about that . You just get this , uh , candle act fired up , head of door pawks . Jabbering . Stocking . And there we go ! I m so glad to be back in Austin Texas , man . I just have so much fun when I m here . I see so many friends . Thanks for coming out . I was in Baker s Field , California , Wednesday night . Boy , you people think you re stupid . Last time I was in Austin was the first time I ve ever blatantly been offered a three way . And I turned it down within one of those deals where it was two dudes and me . I didn t even watch two and a half men . We flew in from Los Angeles and we re going to LA . I said , go through screening . And this guy s just losing his fucking mind because I guess he didn t travel that much . You know , he s used to this equipment . And he s just going crazy . You know , you can have fun with that . You can do what I do . I take two by Angra and demand to pat down . What s that in your pants , Mr . White ? I have no idea . You re going to need to pat that down . Pat it back up again . Give me a couple twists , see if it took to anything . You might want to go wash your hands . I started this tour this summer in Las Vegas and while I was in Vegas , I broke this tooth off at the gum line in an alcohol swimming pool later in a dead . I had a show to do it four hours . I was drunk and missing a tooth . It looked a little unprofessional . Not to me , but to the fine folks at the barrage , you got damn sure , did . I thought I said , you got to get a dentist to pass this up . I will not go on stage looking like this because this tooth doesn t look that big until it s gone . They found it all night dental school . This dentist is 14 years old . </s> <s> He hooks me up to the gas and I don t feel anything . You know , like , do you turn this gas up ? Is there regulation of the state in the bottle ? Which coat one ? Fuck . And I asked him , I said , where d you go to college ? He goes , bring him young . Fuck dude , turn it up to Catholic . Never let a bourbon say your buzz level . Never . Don t do it . And I ll tell you why . They don t understand fucked up the way you and I do . They don t . They re guessing and they re shitty guesses . What you got through with the procedure , you could still tell which tooth you weren t talking to . There was a different color . My teeth look like Indian corn . I had to go to my dentist who s pitching baneers for my teeth because he says I m doing a wide screen . I had definition television . Which is nobody s strength . Every actor I know in Hollywood would rather have low definition narrow screen TV . So they looked thin and fuzzy and stood it clearly fat . I would like to see my dick on a wet screen . That way I quit looking through my reading glasses . Put these on , baby . It looks better than a female . I had no idea how expensive the mirror was . They wanted to do eight teeth on the top and six teeth on the bottom . I was like , well , how much does that cost ? They said 27 , 500 . Fuck how much is dental school ? I ll teach my mother how to do it . We re going back to college , mama . I m going to go to college . You re going to have this to be fun for you then . It was a weird week . I knew it was going to be a weird week because it started off weird . I was going to go to Vegas and day early to do some media . I wanted to see the show called Love . It s also with the Mariah . It s Beetle Circus . The show s fantastic . Fucking job . I was talking to my wife and I living in Atlanta and in Hollywood . We were out in California . I said , I m leaving today at 3 . 30 to go to Las Vegas . I have an airplane that you guys bought me . I lock it a lot . I have to afford you to 500 companies in America . I don t know . They re probably just not wrong . I think I m playing that son of a bitch straight into bankruptcy . I guarantee you , one day I ll be living in a double wide trailer with shank carpet and I ll have a jet with weeds growing through it . </s> <s> I ll be in the front seat going , there s me around . I don t come for money . I come from the opposite of money . I come from no money . Ten years ago I lived in a camper in my friends backyard . He didn t even know I was there . He wasn t even in a nice camper . He was like a homemade pop up camper . Somebody had duct tape that tipped to a golf cart . I had a 20 inch cold in television . I had to pump it up during commercials . I couldn t watch porn on it because nobody s actually worth anything . I would broke . I would die or ask a bunch of money because I don t understand how that works . It s confusing . When I started doing stand up they said that made me an independent contractor and they said I need to start filing my taxes quarterly which I thought meant every 25 years . My brain won t wrap itself around shit and complicated men . My brain does this . I have a tension deficit disorder and learning disabilities . I don t want to ask all the plumber . I m smart but you can t prove it on paper . I do have a GED and if you don t know what GED stands for , you probably got one too . Anyway , I told my wife and said I m leaving day 3 or 3 to go to Vegas . My wife s singer songwriter composer Margot Ray is her name and a brilliantly talented woman . She says , well I m working with a guitar player in the studio till 5 o clock . You can t wait till 5 30 so I can fly with you and I say , can you be there at 5 30 ? She said , yes , which I knew I was the last to do the biggest liar in my life . When it comes to hell I m going to take her to get somewhere . I hear her on the phone all the time just lying through her teeth . We re two exits away . Traffic s really heavy . We should be there at 15 minutes . You re in the fucking bathtub . We would be there at 15 minutes if we were where you said we were . But I told her I said , you get there at 5 30 , you can fly with me . But let me tell you something . Should I test at 5 31 ? I have wheels up and I am fucking gone . I said that . Not very loud . But I said it . 5 31 is there . Is she there ? No . Do I leave ? No . Why ? Because this dick won t suck itself . That s what I m saying . I ve asked her too many , many times . In fact , the other day I sat my dick down and looked him straight in the eye . I said , listen . I know I ve drug you in as a pretty muddy shit in the last 35 years . </s> <s> I need you to get past that . Learn how to suck yourself so I can grow a spine and get on my goddamn wife . I went in one ear and out the other . I had a dick as ears . It has a knife . And it has two ears and a double chin . Mr . Potato dick . The cutest thing ever saw . I got a little outfit to put on . One of them is a raincoat . Not a condom or raincoat . A little yellow slicker with that hat . Looks like that fishing chip s dude . It s the exact same size as the one on the bottom . That s just an interesting bat . What is it , Rob ? Maybe interesting bat . Anyway , so we go see love and Beatles Circus Alacio . Huge fan of Beatles . I just love their music always have . Circus always fun . There are shows that are at the same time . I ve never been able to see it . I ve got eight people from my camp . My wife is next to me . We have great seats because I work for the Mariah . Everything is perfect except right behind me . These two cheeks are just jamboring . Not about the show . Just jamboring . Just jambing . Jambing . Jambing . Jambing . Jambing . Jambing . Jambing . The kind of chicks that can talk around a blow job . I thought I m on night . You don t fix that . I don t have a green door . I m going to come out . I m going to come out . I m going to come out . I ve got one more time . I ve maybe got a shitty nap or anything . I m going to come out . I m going to come out . I m going to swap me and get a dress where it are . Be at home . Something they were long . Long , long , long . And I turn around and look . I noticed their husband were with him . I figured they were at a gun show trying to find a way out of this fucking thing . Well , that s way better . I hear the guest sitting next to him . He said , hey , could you hold it down ? My family is trying to watch the show . She goes , fuck you , we paid our money . We re there for the hell we won t . I m just steaming fucking past the ruin of my god damn night . I can t hear anything with that . I ve been waiting for a year to fucking see this show . And I turned around and very politely . No star would make . Very politely . I said , lady , talking to her live theater as far as social skills goes is like , shitting in the street . If you better mind your own business , I said , do you better quit shitting in the street ? I said , if you don t quit flapping your fucking dog hole dirt , everybody heard that . The boy was a little disturbed as right behind me . Very few people from every to that one . Then 1700 people hear me going , if you don t quit flapping your fucking dog hole dirt . </s> <s> This is all I d have shown called love , by the way . And her murdered and buried in the desert . Beggars , beggars . Careful who you fuck with . And legend has it if you go out into the desert and the moon is full . And the wind dies down . You can still hear jabberins . I m a street shitter . I m shitting in the street . Did you , what the fuck was that ? That s that chick rock hill . They call this jabber gulch . My favorite thing about playing Vegas is they get to play this golf course called Shadow Creek , which is one of the most exclusive golf courses in the world . I worked for them three years . Didn t even know it existed because they knew if I found that it existed , I d pestered the fuck out of them until they put it in my contract , which is exactly what happened . It s amazing this golf course is just fucking so tricked out . The first time I walked through the gates , I was like , nobody s stopping me . It s where all the pros play when they re in Vegas . I was out there this summer and Tiger Woods is out there just gikin around . I may sign my golf glove , I got to meet with the most famous person I ve ever met . I know a lot of famous people but nobody is famous as Tiger Fug of Woods . I love Tiger , man . I defended Tiger when all that stuff first came out . When I heard those initial rumors , I felt sick to my goddamn stomach for the guy because I ve never been accused of doing anything I didn t do . No , one goddamn time . I did it every single time . Now once could I go , no , that was Glim Campbell . I had a lot of things smell like strippers . And I defended him to my wife and said , you don t know what this guy s been through . He had his first famous golf found on television when he was two years old . You don t know where his home life s like . You get judged again because he made one mistake . And he just called number 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 . I started going , got damn Tiger . Come on , buddy . And it got to the point where every time he got caught with another woman , my wife , I go like this . What ? I don t even know the fucking guy . You look like I was holding this dick the whole time . We watched him make that long apology on television and afterwards my wife goes , would he think he got like Tiger , could quit cheating on his wife ? And I said , you bet . What you know is bullshit because you know as well as I do , if a guy likes trains , getting him to quit one s trains , just like getting the dog who likes to kill chickens to quit killing chickens . </s> <s> They don t even know what you re talking about . You got to quit killing chickens . Alright , let me see if I got this trick . I can still kill chickens . No , you can t kill chickens anymore . Alright . Let s say I m in a hotel room with the chicken . Let s say the chicken just wants to touch me . Can t I kill that chicken ? No ? My wife told me all women want the same thing . They want to marry somebody who will never have sex with anybody else , no matter what . And I said , well then maybe you should consider marrying somebody that nobody else wants to fuck . It means that much to you . Don t marry the most famous golfer in the world . Marry the most famous Frisbee golfer in the world . You know when to fuck that dude . We had a chat about cheating that day , man . My wife told me she goes , let s get this straight . Sex is sex , period . I said , no , now wait a minute , or else sex is not the same as intercourse . She goes , it s the exact same thing . I said , it s not the same price . I heard that on the radio . It all comes down to opportunity , man . Some guys are put into a position where they have to say no to beautiful women . That is hard to do . Some guys are never put into that position . That s way fucking easier . I see these big 350 pound guys all the time going , I have never cheated on my wife . But that was tough . Tiger doesn t get any credit for all that pussy you turn down . That s the number you re looking for right there . My wife s best friend , her husband cheated on her . My wife hates Tiger s guts . I m like , what about that guy ? You don t hate that guy . She goes , he did it one time . I said , he had one chance . This guy had sex with 100 of the women he possibly could . His entire goddamn life . Tiger was 18 for 82 , 000 . That takes a little goddamn discipline right there . If 82 , 000 women want to have sex with you and you only fuck 18 of them , that s love . He was in love with that woman . She broke his tiny Tiger heart . He lost all those sponsors , which never made sense to me . This core fan base is me . I don t know one guy in America . He gave me a fiddler fuck what he did . I m here to tell you not one guy in America went , really ? Tiger got some strength pussy ? I m dropping 18 of teeth . Now one guy gave me fiddlers fuck . Now when they were around their wives and act like they gave a fiddler fuck , get all foghorn , leghorn . </s> <s> Why , I never , I can t believe a man would commit such transgressions for his wife . I say , I say , how s his relationship with the Lord ? I d like to know . That if sews around their buddies were like , what are what kind of collonywheres ? I want to smell just like that dude , man . He lost so many sponsors and thinking about bringing them over to Ron White Eak . Not because we need a new face for the company , I just love to have somebody around to have to fade the heat when that fuck up . Ron White Eak , the most selfish prick I ever met in my life . Tiger , get in here . You tell her what you did . Ron White Eak , you re the finest man I have ever known . I shall fall to my bended knee and suck all your penis . Well thank you , baby . Slow down . Watch out for those ears . My new year s resolution this year was to lose some weight and try to get better shape . And I was working out yesterday and I hurt my fat . I sprained my fat roll . Everybody in my camp saw my ass about taking better care of myself . My wife bought me a basketball thing and I might ride it . It s for sale . It s a good deal too . It s like new . It has 750 yards on it . My wife wants me to start doing yoga with her and I said , like , baby , I m not that flexible . She goes , you can bend over and touch your toes . Yeah , it s the only way I touch my toes so big cuts them off and hands them to me . I can t even stand on one foot unless somebody s shining a flashlight . I thought this was funny . My wife yoga schooled the other day and they had my vegan restaurant there . My wife goes , why don t we eat here ? We ve never eaten here . I said , fine , let s eat here because this dick won t suck itself . It s all about compromised folks . I take my tray around all the beans throughout piles and I get to the cash register and my tray is empty . And the purple dreadlocks your kid that runs the cash register goes , Mr . Winner , aren t you going to have something for lunch ? And I said , there s just nothing near that I eat . He picks up a piece of carrot cake , wrapped in a cell of fame . He had to do me . He was trying this . It s vegetarian . The carrot cake is vegetarian . Yeah . So you mean to tell me there s no ham in this ? Because my mother makes a meat lover s carrot cake . It s got sausage , pepperoni , hamburger , meat . Not really hard healthy . She served it with a limpetour and a stint . They have snugies now for dogs and I love dogs . </s> <s> But if I ever see a dog wearing a snuggy , I m going to kill it . Because that s what I think the dog would want me to do . I think of all dogs going to have it . Michael Bicks is going to be a little nervous to be making some cut . Yeah . There s going to be an awkward pause at the pearly gaze . Really ? They re all here ? Yeah , it seems like they re waiting on you too , mate . I m going to slip off to hell . There ll be a lot of them that said , fuck you . We got a bit of a lot of them . It took 10 years of what exactly a calf rope . He was in that house for six years with five wives . I would have shot my fucking cell . I d have had my head out the window screaming it drones . I m over here ! Women . We have a little French bulldog named Pearl . The other day , my wife said , I finally figured it out . That dog is jealous of me . That dog loves you so much . She can t stand it if I m in the same room with you . I said , oh , be ridiculous . She walked through to the kitchen and when she did , Pearl jumped on my stomach and said , I can have all your babies at the same time . She s coming back . Act like nothing s going on . Nothing is going on . I didn t know whether to buy more of that weed or never smoke it again . I went with a . . . I got busted with weed in Florida last year . Less than a gram of weed and they took my happy ass to jail . I ve been partying in Florida for years . I didn t even know they had laws . It looks to me like everybody just run a mutt down there . And I ll run a mutt with you . I ll run the fuck out of a mutt with you . They took me to jail , man . And I tell you what happened . I fired these two pilots for being dickheads . And they were such dickheads . They started following my plan around on a software called Fly to Wear . And if you know the tail number , you can follow any plan in the world anywhere it goes . And then right before I landed in town , they called a cop , said , drug place . The cops are come fuck with me . That s pretty fucking funny . Then they were on the news in Atlanta where I lived . Most of these assholes live on the news , going wrong , white is out of control . He gets drunk on his plane . He smokes pot on his plane . He has sex on his plane . And I m like , this is my plane we re talking about , right ? No , like I did that shit on a Delta flight for fuck s sake . No , my phone s off . My wife got pissed at me when I got busted with that weed and she smokes pot . </s> <s> She fuckers up with that . I come home , she goes , you smoke too much pot . Let me get this straight . You smoke the correct amount of pot . You ever smoke so much pot your wife starts to make sense . Me either . I have this recurring dream that my wife gets run over by a bus . Does that make me a bad person ? I m driving a bus . I m driving a bus . I m driving a bus . I m driving a bus . She s had enough . Early last year in Florida , SeaWorld of Florida , an animal trainer was killed by a killer whale . Turns out there s a reason they didn t name them ocean ponies . Some things are exactly as they say , pugs , killer whales , kill violent whales , where dark sign glasses . I m not sure how the sperm whale got his name , but I m not getting in the pool . I m not sure how the sperm whale got his job back . They put that whale back in the show . I don t know if I saw it on the internet . This will be world news . They put the whale back . This whale killed three people . The most strict pool . And last just a regular pool with a toaster thrown in it . People think they re expensive to make , but it s like 14 bucks . You can reuse the extension cord . People about know that . You get another toaster . They busted a sushi restaurant last year in LA selling whale and they find them 200 , 000 bucks . That is so fucking wrong . I had to take a 50 , 000 pound majestic animal and serve it up to tiny sloths at a time . Oh , that s good . Got any more ? Shit s how we do . We have a shit road . We made a bee ! Come here , Mott ! I m the daughter . I got caught . I m going to have 14 foot fan hanging out of the dumpster . I should have cruiser ed . I probably should have cruiser ed . I live in Atlanta after year and last summer in Atlanta . An idiot teenager was decapitated at a major amusement park in Atlanta on a very famous roller coaster . What I thought was he was all the rides stood up and his head cut off . That s not what happened . While he was all the rides half flew off . When he got off the ride he climbed over two fences and went through two gates telling him not to retrieve this hat . He had been really neat after all . Wow , that story is driven with irony Mr . White . The part of the show where I proved my job better than yours cheers together fantastic . Thank you so much . I was at home last week and my nephew called our house and I never answered the phone in my house . I think he was surprised that I did and I answered the phone and he goes , Uncle Ron , is that you ? </s> <s> He goes , Uncle Ron , did you know it s okay to be gay ? That s why I ran for the fucking phone in my house right there . Now it s my problem . I m like , well you re right it is okay to be gay . Do you know what gay means ? He goes , That s where a man likes a man or a woman likes a woman but they can t have babies . Pretty close . You believe that six years old is getting on what gay ? I didn t find out what gay meant until I started hitchhiking . I wrote a book seven silly secrets truckers just don t want you to know . My wife and I are big fans of the reality TV show on HBO called porn and copious sex in the valley . The reality show about the pornography industry in the San Fernando Valley was where most of it s made . We bought the proceeds and it was fucking hilarious . This one episode was about guys that were straight porn stars but they were doing gay porn because it pays five times of money . And they re interviewing this guy and he goes , Yeah , I was in a scene yesterday with five guys at the same time and I m not even gay . I was like , You re gay and I am . If you can even think of what to do with five dicks at the same time , You re way fuck gay and I am . I was having a gay part of my show . I was having a dare of the other night with this CBS executive . And I ve known for years great fucking dude man and he s gay and I ve never said a word to him about being gay . I just knew that it was and we re having dinner and we re really hills and talking about a potential show . And this chick walks into the restaurant that s LA smoke and fucking hot man probably an actress or a model . And he was in the old switch beans . I don t care if she has children . I don t think the letters line up that that s what it means . She says in a table kind of near us by herself and I had a couple balls of oil and was the dinner and a couple scotches before that . And that was pretty drunk and I said , You mean to tell me that that does nothing for you ? And he looked at and he goes , Not a thing . I said , You mean you would rather have sex with me than her ? Not by much . What if I lost some weight ? I m doing yoga and I m eating him free carrot cake . My dick has ears . That s my favorite thing about LA is the people out there just so goddamn pretty man . I ll tell you how it happened back in the 20s . They started making movies out there and when they did all these beautiful people from all over America flocked to fuck out there to be in the movies . And they couldn t all be in the movies . Some of them got regular jobs but they met those people who were in the movies . </s> <s> They got together and they had these beautiful babies . And those babies grew up and met other babies from the same area and they got together and had even more beautiful babies . And almost the exact opposite thing is happening right now in Kansas . Kansas is full of ugly Twitter . Is there ever been there ? It s true . Those people live on the fucking West Coast . Their forefather got on the Oregon Trail with hard ships . You and I can t even dream of with starvation and weather and cross the Rocky Mountains . Not those people in Kansas . Their forefather got on the Oregon Trail saying , they got to Kansas and fuck it . I m staying here . And then we ll fuck that fat girl right over there . We had a baby . It looks like a potato . And that potato grew up and met another potato from the same town . I m broken , I m broken . Don t be a guy . My wife came over to the store the other day and she goes , I was in the produce department today and this guy told me I was beautiful . Well , baby , he s right . You are beautiful . He said it . Well , I m saying it now . You re beautiful . But he said it . Really ? Ever overdraw his truck in a car ? Ever overdraw his brand new Mercedes straight through the fuck garage door that ever happened to that guy ? It happened to me and I think you re so hot . I fuck you anyway . And if you re one of these guys who want to grow your store telling married women they re beautiful , they re all , hey fuck you . Kill your own chicken , you mother . My wife s best friend has an autistic child named Lewis . Lewis is 12 years old and he s the sweetest child I have ever known . And I remember when he was six and we were at their house Labor Day and Lewis informed me that he was going to run the 40 yard dash for the Space Bowl Olympics at Winnett High School . There were I living in Atlanta and he asked me if I d come move for him . And I said , Lewis , I d love to come move for you . I just need to check my schedule and he goes , wait , check that you re clear . Well then I m your man Lewis . And I got a win man . I was dreading it and I ended up having fun . I thought it was going to be sad . That s why I was dreading . It s a celebration is what it is . People are tailgating . They re not painting their faces in belly s blue but their cooking sauce is getting hammered , betting on these races . They know mistake about it . They are bad on these races . And it s not easy to handicap a race . You got 17 special needs kids in six lanes . You don t know what the fuck s going to happen when they fire that a starting pistol . They could scatter , stop dropping roll . </s> <s> We saw it all that day . They re not drug testing these kids . And they announced the 40 yard Nash and I was making a little wager on my man Lewis , which I did for a hundred bucks . I was looking down the track . I m up in the stands . I was trying to figure out which one s Lewis , which didn t easy because they all wear the exact same thing . They re special empty shirts , special empty shorts . Would they got that back ? Or you can wear whatever footwear you want . And Lewis , or whatever , he s a net chosen yellow rubber boots . We didn t make sense at first and then it started raining . Fuck , if this thing goes off road , I got a natural mudder . And Lewis won . The yellow bluer . That s what I call him now . The yellow bluer is my mom s nickname . His mother called me on the day . Would you please call Lewis to yellow bluer ? But I m on a phone . You re the yellow bluer . It s not like professional sports . You go to the lakeers game . You wave the Kobe Bryant to your arm falls off . He won t wave back to you . Lewis wave back to you in the middle of a fucking race . He didn t give you shit . Lewis s a fan cramly . Lewis will stop us . Nine autographed the yellow bluer . I took my son , Tanger , to Europe this summer . My son is 21 years old now . He s in college , he has his master s entertainment business . He s a great kid and he s so proud of me . He s smart . He s funny . He has my brains high in peaks without my low end problems . Not some good goddamn news for that year . We ve been monitoring him . He s funny . I was doing a corporate gig in Orlando where he goes to college and I was backstage with him . I don t get asked to do a ton of corporate gigs because what do you want your corporate image to be ? We were hoping for an overweight alcoholic to smoke some touches . Let s call Lewis , C . Efron s free . Anyway , I m backstage at the green room with my son and I wear wild socks . Because I knew people give me bizarre socks for whatever reason . I m backstage with my son . I m putting on these weird socks and Marshall goes , Dad , those socks are gay . I said , chicks dig these socks . He goes , chicks , where those socks ? All right , he s my kid . You can stop those tests . I love his mom . His mom s great . She s my second wife . I never argued with her ever , which she didn t want to be married to somebody who s always going to be on the road . The only argument I ever remember having with her was when he was a toddler about whether or not we should spank him and her contention was that if you had an argument with an adult and you disagreed with him , you certainly wouldn t hit him . </s> <s> I said , I would have pied my face . I m not kidding me in my face . See what the fuck happened . She busved him with internet porn when he was 15 and I felt so sorry for it . She called me just squawk and blah , blah , blah , blah . I got horrible for the kid because when I was 15 , I was so horny I could jack off to the Sears cat log . That s just big girl panties and lawn mowers . I can t imagine being 15 years old and having an unstoppable stream of pornography , and being a big boy , you could have a big party party straight into your goddamn bedroom . When I was a kid , I had to earn porn , man . You had to wait till your friend s dad went out of town on business . You had to pull down a rickety spring loaded out of the clatter . You had to crawl up into a dusty spider ridden fucking crawl space , eight millimeter real , then what ? Learn how to work a fucking projector . That s what . And after all that , you got silent , bushy porn . And if there was a soundtrack , it was always so fucked up , you couldn t understand it . You can stay his finger in or in , and his penis in or rear . Watch the movie . We had one friend that was two years younger than us and he went , she put her in her mouth ! I didn t know she was gonna put it in her mouth ! She s gonna need to brush her teeth ! Not yet but she will watch the film ! Note to self , put it in her mouth ! So Lori told me she doesn t have a class name , she goes , you re gonna need to talk to your son about sex and time . She goes , when are you gonna do it ? I said he s gonna be at the house this weekend so I thought to him and said , okay fine , I said , I ll turn off television . I said , turn it off , I need to talk to you . I said , I want to talk to you about sex . Oh dad , come on ! I said , now you re 15 years old , it s time we had this talk and he goes , okay ? I said to Clotaurus , his sensitive is an eyeball ! Say it again , that s all I got ! Don t go rub it underneath his dry , turn that TV back on boy ! What about safe sex ? Dad , yeah , never safe , their husband s always come home , that s a fucking myth ! And so smart , man , I just can t believe how smart kids are today .

Click click porn ! People fucking on the phone ! But my mother didn t know they answered to a question , I had to go to the library , which is like building , where they used to store the knowledge . Now it s just a place where homeless people piss . Well my mother used to drop me off of the library when I was a kid and I was always so intimidated by it because it was so big and you had to be quiet because the knowledge is sleeping . You had to learn a decimal system made up by some fucking name Doe E . Then you had to peruse a hundred thousand square foot and build it with volumes of knowledge and floor seal and seal on the floor , you had to cross reference Doe E s bullshit with the author s name and the card catalog . And you finally get to the place where the knowledge that you seek is supposed to be and it might not fucking be there . Where s the knowledge that I seek ? Yes , somebody else has got it . Where do they go to bring it back ? They keep it for a month , for a nickel . How much for to learn what I need to know ? Yes , your mother ? My mother didn t know how to work a projector ? She s at Dill School for fuck s sake . Don t try to do the math on that bit . I was just talking to her . The guy actually stopped my show a few weeks ago and he goes , well I wait a minute now if this summer you were backing off Vegas and that s when you broke your tooth . That s when your mother went to Dill School and now you re seven years old you re saying your mother s already telling you what . What did it really ? You had no problem with Pearl jumping on my stomach and saying she could have all my babies at the same time . But the math on this one joke has got you so fucked up you just have to talk . Tell you the internet changed everything and certainly changed the way people don t buy music . The record industry is on its ear man because what they manufacture became easier to steal than it is to buy . And that s just the fact of nature these days . No figure it out . I used to sell millions of comedy albums and now it s hard to sell them because it s just so easy to fucking rip it off . Just click click out of my IRA into your fucking pod . When I was a kid you had to get a ride to Sears which is a building . </s> <s> You had to find the record department on your own . Then you had to cram a 12 inch by 12 inch album down your shorts . Then you had to sponge Bob Square pants and would let Zeppelin to cram down your fucking pants . Hoping nobody was gonna catch your ass . That s stealing music . We didn t have Viagra . You had to like somebody to fuck them . I m kidding you didn t either . You didn t either . Grudge fuck the hell out of them . We didn t have Blue Mountains on our beer cans to tell you if they were called . You had to open a refrigerator and reach in there and touch that beer can or you d never know . But somebody somewhere went , well if we only had some sort of thermostat on each individual can . Like a mountain changing color to see the optimum freaking temperature . Thank you Rocky Mountain . Even though your beer tastes like ass . Those mountains should turn brown . So I tour that s what I do . I go from city to city to city to city . I ve done it for 27 years .

That s my favorite room with a whole wide fucking world . I tour with my wife usually and I love to tour with my wife because I only have sex with my wife and I don t have sex with other women . I ve been married three times and that is not always been my policy . When I was young I used to talk to my cousin about this race we were going to have to see who gets married first . I came in second fourth and seventh . I feel like my wife misled me a little bit when we first got together because when we first got together she was all about , you know what I don t ever want to have children . I m just one of those women that ever felt there is to give birth . And I don t like real diamonds . I don t like them because of that blood diamond thing . You know what I like to do ? Suck dick and cook . I like to suck dick and I like to cook . In fact when I m not cooking I m sucking dick and when I m not sucking dick I am cooking . In fact if there was a way I could suck your dick while I was cooking . If we got a stool and you stood on it and I could blow you while I m scrambling some eggs wearing fake jewelry not having a baby all at the same time . That would be heaven for me . Fuck me too ! Cut to five years later she d on the phone with Chad and trying to adopt a baby she got a diamond on her finger . It was like a so we re fucking heating unit . </s> <s> I m jacking off the TV dinner . Wonder what she s got under that snuggie . But she s naked and she s shitting under that snuggie . We have a great sex life . We have a 69 someone so long you start to miss each other . In the snow turn to rain . I love you . April May . And it s a boat . A wick about you s shape . We did it one time so long it turned into another number . What is this ? A 71 ? If you re toe in my nose what the fuck are you doing ? My wife has a new move in the bedroom . My wife s never moved in the bedroom . She s look at me . Look at me . Open your eyes for a hug . Look at me . And that s a lot of pressure . Look into the eyes of the woman you love while you re making love . And look deep into her soul . And still see another woman . What the fuck are you doing here ? I thought you got hit by a bus . I m great as sex . I come every time . I m like 4 , 000 in a row or something ridiculous . I have a number of gifted really I guess . My wife s maybe a third is good as me . I don t think she s trying . Hi , I said the other day what s the fucking problem here baby ? She goes well for one thing is a fat sweaty guy laying on top of me . Is that breaking my nose in Jason ? Get off me dude I m trying to come . I was not sure what I m about to come . I have to focus up on a Navy SEAL . I have to words I lean there like a wounded man to team . Pokemon with a stick see if he knew . My wife gives the best head if you ever have a chance . First time my wife gave me a blowjob my hands went my my like I m either having a stroke or this girl knows her where I don t win . I told her when she got finished I said that s the best damn blowjob I ever had in my life . My wife bought a lot . And she goes I know it s kind of weird because I used to be not that good at it . It was talking to my friend Ted the florist who lived down the street and I just asked him how he does it . You suck my dick like Ted the florist ? Now that motherfucker knows what he s doing . Now every time I see Ted I m like you re not going to school dude . All it Ted s head . Two lips for every occasion . You get open a head and breakfast . Well then what would my slogan be food it s the only thing that doesn t suck . You guys have been fantastic I m going to close with my oh . So nobody s watching the dogs again . I ll try to get Pearl to play by my face . Pearl s favorite thing she can have all my babies at the same time . Her favorite thing in the world is for me to buy her face because she s like a billy goat fucking elbow or whatever it is . </s> <s> So if I lay down on the floor sometimes she didn t do it last show so you have to be quiet . If I tell her to buy my face she ll grow and jump up and land or mouth right on my face and I ll buy it . So let s try . Pearl , you want me to buy my face ? Who wants to buy it ? Who wants to buy it ? Who wants to buy it ? Who wants to buy it ? Who wants to buy it ? Who wants to buy it ? Who wants to buy it ? Who wants to buy it ? Who wants to buy it ? Who wants to buy it ? I m going to close the show this evening with my Dr . Phil Stort . Dr . Phil McGraw is a friend of mine . We play golf together all the time . He s a great guy . You never know . We became friends from being a fan . You never know if you see somebody on TV what they re going to be like in person . Doc s a solid fucking dude . I guarantee you that . He s straight as he can be but he s a great fucking hang . He s a great asset for me . My father passed away when I was young and now I m in this big business world . I can bounce all these things that I have going on off a dock in his 35th lawyer . That s a big deal for me . I m a really good friend for this son , Jamie McGraw . Anyway , the other day I was talking to my son about self esteem . A few days later I was playing golf at Doc and I said , Doc , if you re going to tell somebody one thing to do to make themselves feel better about who they are , what would it be ? And he said , finish the things you star and I said , well that s brilliant . And I went home and there was a half a bottle of scotch sitting on the camera . I think I know what he s getting at . That s my Dr . Bill Story . Here s my Dr . Bill Story . Every year Doc and his family rent a yacht for 12 days in the Mediterranean and that s their vacation . It s the only way he can get away . Because he is the most famous person in America . He s the most recognizable face . Six foot four ball dumb head porn must that you can spot him from any fucking world . And because he seems so approachable on television and he really is approachable . I mean , the sweetheart of a dude . But people are always , anytime he goes out and pellets through his mouth . And that s fine at first , but eventually he will eat the skin off your fucking bones . You can t walk out of your house without somebody going , hey , my brother , I ll fuck them in . </s> <s> I m going to feed you , sit out for your stag . Come back here . Asshole . And that s exactly how it happens . I ve seen it . So that s what they do . Well , last summer of my wife and I went on vacation to France in Loneco . And I need to break too . Sometimes I do 140 cities a year . I do more dates than any other comic . More cities than any other comic work in the day because I just love fucking doing it . And 20 minutes from now , nobody s going to give a fuck about what I have to say . While they do , I believe I ll do a lot of shows . So we re in France and Monaco . And having a great time . I m really in love with my wife . She s so talented . We re a fun life together . And we re there . And one day the phone rings and it s dark . And he goes , aren t you guys in Monaco ? And I said , yeah . We re going to be in Monaco tomorrow . And we re going to be in Monaco . And we re going to be in Monaco . And we re going to be in Monaco . And we re going to be in Monaco . And we re going to be in Monaco . And we re going to be in Monaco . And we re going to be in Monaco . And we re going to be in Monaco . And we re going to be in Monaco . And we re going to be in Monaco . And we re going to be in Monaco . And we re staying at the Fairmont Hotel over . Look at the old Yard Harbor in Monaco . Very cool place . And we were down there looking at the Yacht today before . And wouldn t it be cool if you knew somebody to have one of these things . You could just hop on it and fucking throw the fuck man . And it s everybody s yacht , man . This is yacht heaven . This is Steve Winsh . Prince Albert of Monaco s yacht . This is that Russian dude with a tiny giraffe . Anyway , they re coming in at 630 in the evening . So the next morning we wake up . The next afternoon we wake up . We go ahead with this amazing lunch . We re drinking this fucking crate wine from France probably . That d be my guess . I had to guess . And I did have to guess . Friends . And we re just having a great , great day . And we go down to the fucking harbor . That evening at 630 , sure enough , dogs back at 165 foot yacht . I m not sure that s how they do it . So the only way to get on the yacht is to walk on this game plank to get on the yacht and walk on the game plank . Going , nobody s stopping me . And we get on the yacht and there s our friends from California halfway around the world . And we re fucking kidding me . </s> <s> How much fun are we having ? I m hug and everybody . There s a bunch of people on the yacht . Well , anytime I m hugging you and I m in a strange place , what I m really doing is looking over your shoulder trying to find a bar . That s why I m turning you . And I see the bar and right the dead for us to the bar is a bottle of famous black grounds , which is a Scotch . I started drinking when I was in Scotland for the Open Championship in Turnberry . And you start looking at what the Scotts drink and that s for the day drink . And I m like , oh , yes . And they had a bottle of it on the fucking East Canal , or the fine . And the bartender pulled me up big old glass of whiskey , way bigger than this one . And I m like , I m in such a great mood . It tastes better than I ever tasted any fucking Scotch ever . Who s a good lord ? That tastes like butter , honey , aged and Lindsey Lowhands pussy . It tastes so good I m excited to skip dinner . I just have a couple more of them . I m going to scare me up another one of these . How about one more ? I ain t had a drink since lunch . I was like , thirsty . I was going to have it . And Doc noticed I was really drinking hard . And he goes , well , you re really drinking the night , Ron . I said , yeah , Doc , something that just tastes like spring water . He goes , why don t you just drink spring water , Ron ? I don t know . I m not a fucking doctor . So this is going on for fucking hours . Now they really love Margot . They really , really love my wife , Margot . Margot s son , Dr . Phil Show , a few times . And they go everywhere to see her . And Margot was a 4 1 1 1 1 2 classically trained opera singer . The same rock and roll and jazz . And whatever she s been singing here for years . And Robin McGraw loves to go to my wife and the same . And my wife loves to be goaded into singing . And they make a great little fucking team . So we re on the back of this shot . And Robin goes , come on , Margot s singing for us . And Margot gets up . There s people on the back party on all these yachts . And the bar will appear . People out there . And Margot gets up . And she sings . They love jazz . And Frank that s a Monica . They have jazz clubs all over the place . And she gets up . </s> <s> And she sings a jazz standard at full voice . Which I don t get to hear singing full voice . She sings around the house , but not at full voice . And when she sings at full voice , it makes me cry . Oh no . And she finishes the first song at full voice . And people stand up on the back of all these yachts and start cheering . Yeah . And I m like , oh , how cool is this , man . I m like , oh , you really dig jazz . I forgot that much . They dig jazz . She gives up things and other song fucking screaming . And then people are gathering up around the back of the boat . By song four , there s 400 people behind this boat listening to her saying , you could hear a pin drop just like this pin drop . And she just killing it . And I have a little secret . Fucking hammered , man . I am so drunk . I can t even believe it . My fucking self outdrunk . I am like , these are black balls . And I would take a drink and I d take one little sip out of it . I d talk to somebody . I d look back and I d say , I m empty . Anybody else drinking out of this glass ? Miss calculation . Anyway , she does seven or eight songs and she goes , OK , guys , that s enough . And she says , down in dog goes , well , Ron , you want to do something ? I got a preface this with . He s on vacation with his best friend and head lawyer and his wife Mary Pat . Their bag just from Dallas . They re a little fucking straight . And they re about to find out my secret . About 20 years ago , I was doing a bet that was so filed that I only did it for about a week . And I just quit doing it . I m like , it s not the duration . I want to take my grouse for my show . And I have no idea when I pick that night to dust her off and take her for a sip . The other day I was 10 fucking baby eyes and how . Right before I came , my dick slipped and went straight down to the tracheum tube . Here s the moral question . Do you pull out or dump a load into her lungs ? Yots are pulling up and you re on both sides of it . These passes , they can pull them up . They re leaving the harbor so fast there s a surfamal wake . There s a stampede in tiny giraffes diving off the pier , swimming towards the ocean and certain net . People are pulling her kids off the pier . I don t think they heard me . I m going to do it again . </s> <s> The dog goes , that s enough out of you run . And Margot s tapping me out . You ever been tapped out ? Come on baby , it s time to go . She s seen it . Come on honey , let s just go back to hotel . It s time for us to go . Go , go , come on baby . Baby , let s just go back to hotel . Come on , Ron . There s , oh don t drop , don t drop , snap , snap , snap , and I ll do it . And that s big fluid drug that means I don t know when I want to have them . When I want to leave , I ll never go perfectly good time . Turns out they were the consensus . Okay I ll leave . The only way to get off the ship is to walk back off that gang plank . At the end of the gang plank there s an 18 ish drop off . And my wife s in front of me , Margot s in front of me . And I think it s at the end of the gang plank . I was like , big step , Ron , I said , thanks Doc . I think I made a big step towards something . I don t know , he s in the big trick college . It s not me . It s amazing how much speed you could pick up in 18 inches . It s nothing like falling over on the same level that you re already on . I just slammed down to that fucking pier . I landed square on this elbow dislocated this shoulder . Put a four inch gage down the back of my arm and I was so drunk I just bounced off that pier . Fade the black . I wake up the next morning with the shoe buddies . All I do is lay there and bed and go . I can t move my shoulder . My shirt stuck to my arm with blood and giraffe hair and whatever the fuck else you re firing on a pig . I have a wet jolly rancher in my armpit . I had to cut it out with a pair of scissors . You almost can t eat them after that . A slowly open my aching fucking eyes and there s Margot . What happened ? You got really drunk last night , Ron . What did I do ? Well you did the tits fucking Mamie Eisenhower story . Did Mary Pat left ? Mary Pat left ? She s buddy . You think they got anybody s back over to party on the hot today ? I don t know what s going to happen now . I just started to rape myself . I m like , why do you get so drunk ? You have a wonderful son and a beautiful wife and a great career . About 10 to phone rang and it was dark and you guys are going to come party on the hot . Thanks for playing along . I ve never performed for a better crowd in my God damn wife . Bless your hearts for a list of so many people . </s>"

        "transcript": "<s> Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome Ellen DeGeneres . Good morning , Father All right , thanks . No . Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you very much . Well , thanks . What a lovely way to start work . Thank you very much . I encourage you to do that for your co workers next time they walk into work . Give them that because it s a lovely way to start your job . Thank you so much . What s great about this , you know , you think about it . You have a room full of people . Everybody is so different and we re all here for different reasons . Everybody has a different story . Some people are longtime fans and bought their tickets the day they went on sale and I m always appreciative . There they are . Five of them . And yet look at the seats they get . That s a shame . Some of you had to get babysitters , especially if you have kids . Some people maybe you re in a bad mood . You had a fight with your boyfriend or your girlfriend or your husband or your wife or your lover or your partner or your roommate or your . . . Nice . The point is you re in a bad mood . Now I m going to have to work even harder to make you laugh all because you have to have things your way and you won t back down . But that s all right because we re all here and with all of our differences we all have one thing in common . We re all gay . Now there are people out there going do they think we re gay because we re here ? Did we look gay ? I told you this would happen . We re not going to understand a word of this . No , that s my one obligatory gay reference . I have to say something gay otherwise some people might leave here tonight going . She didn t do anything gay . She s not our leader . What happened to our leader ? You see though if you re here you re probably gay . You have tendencies , you ve thought about it . Now there are people going I have thought about it . Does that mean I m gay ? Why not gay ? Is that how they get us ? Now I think the one thing we all have in common is that we all want to laugh and that is a beautiful thing . I m stalling . I have a problem with procrastination and I m supposed to start the show and I m not . This procrastination thing , whenever there s something I m supposed to do I ll do anything other than the one thing that I m supposed to do and then I feel bad about myself and then I get depressed and then I really don t get anything done because I m depressed and I told a friend of mine about this problem and she said you should go to therapy and I thought about it and I thought well wait a minute why should I pay a stranger to listen to me talk when I can get strangers to pay to listen to me talk . So that s when I came up with the idea of touring and I thought now I have to write a show . </s> <s> I thought what do I want to say ? What do I want to talk about ? I sat down on my desk and I was staring at my desk and I thought wow that s dusty . I can t write with my desk all dusty like this so I went downstairs to get a rag and on the way downstairs my kitten was on the stairway playing with a piece of dust or something and I went to pet the kitten because it did the thing where they roll on their back and show you the belly and you got to reward that you can t pass that up . So I sat down on pet in the cat for about I don t know 45 minutes something like that and then I went downstairs and by that time I d forgotten why I went downstairs and I was staring around trying to remember and I thought I should paint this room . I wonder what color this is it looks like a white but I m sure there s some fancy name for it all these people what kind of job is that to come up with a name for paint colors you know all the different color whites like egg shell or linen or lily or off all the different ones you know and then I thought maybe yellow you know canary or banana or smokers teeth you know something that would be I thought I ve got it right so maybe if I put music on it would be more inspiring so I went over to the cabinet where I keep all my CDs you should have seen that thing total disarray just oh everything meat loaf was next to the cranberries which I thought it d be funny one night to organize it by food when I was drunk really nothing else was in there except bread and just all kinds of weird like the doors and the carpenters and nine inch nails were together and that doesn t help anything so I thought I ve got to organize this I can t put this off and so I m sitting in the hundreds of CDs and the phone rang and it was a friend of mine I said I can t talk I m writing and so she said I can t believe you you re so disciplined I have such a problem with procrastination and I said well we should go to lunch and talk about that so we went to lunch and we were talking about procrastination and the waitress over her this and she said I have a problem with procrastination too I said really get my sandwich and so but that s when it hit me that s what I should talk about procrastination that s a problem everybody has that s universal procrastination and then I said oh who I kidding I m never going to get around to write about procrastination and so my friend said that s why I brought this video tape if you watch this guy he keeps your focus he keeps you on track you ll never procrastinate again so about a week later I ll pop in the tape I find that if you don t press play right away something s on TV all the time we have 700 channels now when did this happen when I was a kid we have five channels we didn t have remote you had to hate something bad enough to get up and walk that five feet to change the channel damn bananas of those horses are so much louder when they run it was a simpler time back then you know we were so easily entertained we would watch anything we would watch a flying none we d watch a talking horse we are so much more sophisticated now watching people eat bugs and marry strangers for money oh we ve come a long way haven t we it s enough to make you miss me Barry isn t it oh that was a great show man the pace on that show nothing ever happened on that show when there s time for whistling there s a lot of time on a show everything was different it was just slower and longer commercials were six minutes long telling us how delicious cigarettes and alcohol were man those people were happy smoking and drinking weren t they people are still happy in commercials but now they re concentrated in 30 seconds they have to be happy in 30 seconds and there s some happy people too that that woman in the shampoo commercial she s happy she s she s too happy I fell for it though I bought the shampoo like I got to tell you I was shampooing for a good half hour and I never got that happy I finally I just had to fake it you know because had to get out of the shower it s amazing 30 seconds and we get invested in those characters on the commercial you know that old man who can eat corn on the cob again I m happy for him he couldn t eat it for a while now I can that woman on jury duty gotta go gotta go gotta go right now gotta go gotta go gotta go gotta go you gotta go in the judge doesn t understand well it s such a relief by the end of that commercial and I don t have to go right now oh fantastic lady those jingles are catchy we retain that in 30 seconds we remember all this stuff you know because of the repetition I believe that someday sitcoms will be 30 seconds long because that s all we ll need and that s all our attention span can take because our attention span is shot we ve all got attention deficit disorder ADD or OCD or one of this disorders with three letters because we don t have the time and patience to pronounce the entire disorder that should be a disorder right there TBD too busy disorder what s with the sudden choice of disorders that we ve got now you know when I was a kid we just had crazy people that s all just crazy people all the commercials on television now are for anti depressants for pro s act or paxle and they get you right away are you sad do you get stressed do you have anxiety yes yes I have all those things I m alive I don t want to take a pill go to Africa go follow some bush man around he s getting chased by a lion that stress I m not gonna find a pig me on paxle I ll tell you that right now so it s watching the news the other day brought to you by paxle well now I need it smart advertising that s another thing too when I was a kid the news was on once a day either caught it or you missed it now the news is on 24 hours a day and that s not enough they got a guy talking and then there s a crawl down there so you got that guy talking you got the crawl going you re online you re putting your opinion on your poll no I say to that no I said no too that s right and then if you stop paying attention the crawl you go back to that guy for a minute and then you go back to the crawl and you catch the end of something Madonna s left foot what about Madonna s left foot what happened you waiting for it to come back around again goes to commercial are you sad do you get stressed there should just be one crawl that goes around over and over again things are getting worse that s all we need and the local news man they want you to watch every broadcast they ve got don t they it s not good enough you re watching the one you re watching they do these teases to get you to watch later on there s so incredibly cruel it could be the most deadly thing in the world and you may be having it for dinner we ll tell you what it is tonight at 11 is it peace I feel sorry for the newscasters you know we can turn it off but that s their job and they have to read these stories and they re just coming up on the teleprompter they don t know what s coming up and they ve got to go through this range of emotion that there were no survivors and next which candy bar helps you lose weight still to come is an asteroid headed towards earth but first where to find the cheesy is pizza in town also a disturbing new study finds that studies are disturbing it s schizophrenic by the end of the news aren t they no wonder they snap when they start talking to the weatherman you ve noticed it it s everywhere they go to some fantasy land when they start talking to the weatherman and now let s go to Johnny with the weather Johnny when are you going to stop this rain and bring us some sunshine I ll stop the rain when you stop the car jacking s Colleen the weather is actually the happiest part of the news because at some point you re going to hear something positive you re going to hear it s a beautiful day or it s going to be a beautiful day and it s nice to take in something positive you know because we hear all this negative stuff all the time and we go out into the world and it s so chaotic and we re not that we re going to notice if it s a beautiful day we re moving too fast to even pay attention to that and we have we need help to keep up with that pace so we put a coffee shop here and there s a coffee shop here and a coffee shop here and a coffee shop here and the smallest coffee is a tall and I ll have a coffee in a side of Red Bull because I m very very busy I ve got TBD and I m late for yoga hurry hurry that we re trying to even do yoga is a joke isn t it I mean we re basically we re paying for silence that s what we re doing with that time we re paying for silence I was in yoga the other day and I m in full lotus position and my shockers are all aligned and my mind is all clear to bold chatter and I m looking out on my third eye and everything I m supposed to be doing it s amazing what comes up when you sit in that silence mama keeps whites bright like the sun like mama s got to mad at the floor rocks too yeah can t stop that song there is no silence there s just constant noise all the time and people are talking all the time and even with all the talking there s no communication we re not and even when we say how are you we don t mean how are you we don t care just give us a fine or a good a one syllable answer and move along and don t even say pretty good that s a follow up question pretty good something happened I don t have time but we learn we re conditioned not to engage in full conversation you know because as soon as you start to talk to somebody somebody cell phones gonna go off immediately thank god they got rid of those obnoxious rings huh and we certainly don t have full conversations on cell phones you know usually the reception is so bad but it s only bad on your side the person talking to you has no clue they re just rambling on and on you ve got your finger jammed in your ear you re shushing people on the street your duck behind a dumpster so you can hear about your friend s new haircut what about the bangs are they shorter are the bang shorter the bangs at least if they re static or something you you you have a warning you have an indication you re gonna lose the call you know it s actually there s nothing worse than it being crystal clear reception and you ve been rambling on for who knows how long only to find out that it cut out who knows how long ago you get then you learn you know you re scared to ever have a full conversation ever again you stop yourself in between hey so we were gonna go to the cheese shop hello all right and so we knew we were having white wine still there all right and I thought what kind of cheese would be best at alluzia all right and I like monster even if you re on on a phone on you know at home you re gonna be interrupted by something by call waiting usually which was invented as a convenience but it s really turned into a many people s choice awards hasn t it and you find out right away who wins or loses you re having a pleasant conversation with what you think is a good friend you hear the click they tell you to hold on you re confident they re gonna come back to you and then they come back and they say I ve got to take this other call you know what that means they just said to the other person let me get rid of this other call that s what you just became you don t have to get the call way you can let it go to voicemail that s why we have voicemail to catch those calls that we miss my the voicemail that I like the best is the one where you insert your name into it and then you end up sounding more like a robot than the robot your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system Ellen is not available is that how I say my name yeah I d like to make reservations for dinner there s four of us and the name is Ellen oh this wireless technology we can talk to anybody anywhere anytime and we just take that for granted you know it wasn t that long ago that we had one phone in the house cord was just being invented back then there was a shortage of cord maybe you had a foot or two from the wall to the phone back then when you said you were on the phone you were on the phone then the kitchen wall phone came along kind of an avocado or a mustard green usually that a groovy color there was a lot of cord there was that 90 foot cord between the receipt you could just walk all over the house talking on the phone clearing tables wrapping around the dog so that by the time you hung up that phone it just became this giant ball of cord confusion right there but what was fun is every so often you d hold that cord and let the phone spin and find itself back again good times we re losing the simple pleasures we don t have that anymore now we have hands free phones so you can focus on the thing you re really supposed to be doing you know chances are if you need both of your hands to do something your brain should be in on it too just me this technology we have all these buttons everything you know speed dial read all your program numbers in so you never have to remember them anymore and so you don t you know use it or lose it I m losing it I just I don t remember anything anymore because of the buttons that are remembering things for me have you ever forgotten what you were going to say as it s coming out of your mouth hey you know what what what was I going to say what was I going to say hey suddenly forcing them to participate we were talking about floor lamps no mariah carry no suddenly it s a ten thousand dollar pyramid for these people things that taste like chicken things a monkey would wear that s right we re talking about tiny hats that s bad when you forget we were going to say two words in but what s worse than that as you forget what you re going to say after you ve been talking for a while a whole bunch of people are sitting around talking about some subject matter heated discussion they all have opinions and you don t really and then suddenly you think hey maybe I do so you jump in there and then you start thinking it s a pretty good opinion and when they hear this opinion they re going to think she s smarter than I thought I had no idea how smart she was so you start congratulating yourself and because of celebrating too soon you ve completely forgotten the point that you were trying to make and you re still talking now they re looking at you you like you you don t know what you re talking about and you don t but you can t let them know that so you just keep talking praying that the point will come back to you and it doesn t so you start panicking because not only have you forgotten the point you ve completely forgotten the subject matter that anybody was talking about so now you really start panicking you start sweating you have to loosen your tie if you re a man or Diane Keaton or Avril Lavigne and then you just try to get out of it by saying any generic statement that comes to mind you know well six a one half a dozen of the other it s a slippery slope my friend teach him and a fish and there s no eye in team you it s technology it s hurtness I say I blame the microwave for most of our problems anything that gets that hot without fire that s from the devil you know believe me you put a hot pocket in there for three or four minutes pop that thing in your mouth if that s not hell ladies gentlemen I don t know what is we re lazy we have buttons doing everything for there s no physical activity attached to anything anymore even the garage door opener we used to have to get out of the car and open up the garage door now there s a button you push you know and the the car window this became too much with this I don t want to churn butter I just want fresh air we still use that gesture if we want somebody to roll their window down in traffic we still use that even though nobody s got it because we d look like idiots if we did this you we re lazy even we used to have breathments now we have breath strips they just dissolve on our tongue for us how lazy can we not suck anymore uh put it on I m tired uh I have a hot day we re lazy we re on the go we ve got food on the go we ve got gogert yogurt for people on the go was there a big mobility problem with yogurt before how time consuming was it really hello oh hi tom oh I ve been dying to see that movie oh no I just opened up some yogurt I am in for the night not even later it s the kind with the fruit on the bottom well thanks anyway have fun that s a shame and where we go and that there won t be food when we get there this food everywhere we ve gotten abundance of food we ve got all you can eat places we don t need to be eating all we can eat we re not bears we re not hibernating we ll be back tomorrow night to eat the same amount of stuff and only in the darkness of a movie theater do we not feel guilty about eating a three pound box of snow caps we stock up on popcorn and candy like we re crossing the seara s don t we you have any vinescent or hard tack or anything like that all right I ll have a couple of soft pretzels a hot dog uh milk duds jujubees is that the largest popcorn that bucket you don t have a barrel or anything like that hmm you have a donkey or a pack mule or anything I want a diet coke and something about the darkness we just lose all of our inhibitions in the darkness is the popcorn really that delicious we must shovel handfuls of it into our mouth oh Then you have these people in the movie theater that talk the whole time during the movie . </s> <s> You ever go with somebody like that to a movie but you don t realize until you get there , you re with somebody like that . A brand new movie , first day it s opened , you re there together and the entire time they re sitting there . Where is she going ? Why do you do that ? Is he mad at her ? I don t know , let s watch and find out together , shall we ? You know who you are . You re denying it right now . I do not do that . Why is she saying that ? What s she going to say next ? Then you have these people sitting by and you have that nervous foot that just vibrates the whole time and it finds its way to the back of your chair or they cross and uncross their legs and kick the back of your chair and you want to turn around and say please stop it . But you don t . This is how we try to get that point across . Don t they know the international signal for that s irritating ? Or you have these people , if you have the rocking chair seats , they need to use your seat back as leverage to get up out of their seat behind you . You just go flying back for a second there . I feel like you re going to get catapulted out of there for a second . No acknowledgement , no I m sorry , no nothing . They re just walking away with chunks of your weave in their hand . People aren t as considerate as they used to be , I find . I wouldn t mind hearing a few more please and thank you . That wouldn t hurt anybody . Would it ? You ever hold the door open for somebody and they just waltz right through there ? No eye contact , no thank you , no nothing . You re just standing there . Well you re welcome , you re majesty . Sorry I didn t sprinkle rose petals for you . But then you just meant to hold it for that one person . Suddenly it s like a clown car let out . You re just standing there three and four a second or screaming through . Nobody will take it from you . You ever been running for an elevator and there s somebody in there and they see you running they just stand there . Like they don t want you to make it . It s awkward when you do make it isn t it ? You didn t think I d make it did you ? Well I did . If somebody s running for the elevator I m going to try to hold the door . I m going to stick my arm out until it s too risky . I m not going to do it when it s risky . But and then sometimes if it s an elevator you haven t been in you can t find the panel of the hieroglyphics of arrows of which one to push . But I m going to let them know as the doors are closing . </s> <s> I did all I could . We want to be in there by ourselves . That s nothing wrong with admitting that . You know it s a tiny little space close proximity to a stranger . It s silent . That s awkward . I always try to break that silence by saying something . You know . First day of parole . Or hey want to smell something weird . What s funny to me is you won t say that but you ll think about it when you re in there with somebody and then you laugh and then they ll wonder why you re laughing . The elevator is a convenience and a mode of transportation I m all for . It takes you up high fast , fantastic . But there are certain modes of transportation that come along with that moving sidewalk and the airport . You know I could see if you get in the airport get on the thing and it takes you right to the gate then that s convenient . But it s not it s just in the middle of nowhere one little section of the airport like a little ride in the middle of nowhere . What s that serving what s that I mean it s fun because it s moving so if you re moving while you re like the bionic woman you re flying past people on the ground . The hard thing is adjusting to walking again once you get off . Find your pace . What about those people who get on there and then they just stand on there what s that about . Thank God they re on there I don t know how they get anywhere . You think with all these things that are speeding things up for us and moving us along that we d get places earlier at least on time . You still have those people that are late all the time . You know it s one thing if you re late once in a while but these people that are consistently late they always have the same excuse . Sorry traffic . Really ? How do you think I got here helicoptered in ? I allow for it then they get all defensive sorry and when they say it like that they don t mean it . Not when it goes up in the middle like that sorry that s not sorry . That s like those people who say something like insulting and then they end it with just kidding like that erases it somehow . Hey did you get a haircut ? Hope you didn t pay for that thing . I m just kidding . Well then you don t know how to kid properly because we should both be laughing . I find a lot of people don t know how to kid properly . People don t understand the definition of kidding . You know you tell somebody something sad that my dog of 17 years just died . You re kidding . Funny as that is I m not . People always say things they don t mean . You know like people who say the worst thing . Oh the paper cut that s the worst thing . Is it really ? Okay . What about pickle juice in your eye ? That s pretty bad too isn t it ? You ever had pickle juice in your eye ? Boy those pickle jars have you tried to open them lately they re vacuum sealed . </s> <s> You can t open those jars . There s so tight you know there was a time there was a big old barrel in a general store you d roll up your sleeve and dip in there for a big old deal and those days are gone . Now they re all in the jars and they re vacuum seal you re trying to open them and you cannot get them squatting helps sometimes . That s actually and you always have that one person in the kitchen and give it . I got it . Give it I got it . I got it . Give it I got it . Give it I got it . I got it . I got it . I got it . I got it . Give it . Determine to get it and then you finally hand it over and they just pop it right off . Well I loosened it . And then once you get the lid off that s where the danger the pickle juice in the eye comes along because the juice is to the top . They re not kidding around with that juice are they . Man that juice is up and the pickles are packed in there like I wish they packed potato chips the way they pack pickles . It s all air there s just six potato chips once you get the thing open . Pickles are packed in there like sardines which by the way if you ve opened up or not packed as tightly as pickles . That expression should change . So now . Now you ve got to get the pickle out of there right and they re packed in there like pickles . It ll catch on and so then . You need help and you re looking for that little stem that s still attached to dried little dill handle if you will . Ever so gently you try to lift and it comes off and you knew it would but you try . So then you have to go into the pickle claw and the pickle claw . You know it you know it well it s the same claw it s upside down as the claw to get the spare toilet paper roll that hasn t dropped yet . That s the same claw . Notice next time toilet paper claw pickle claw . Then once you get the pickle out of there . Just pickle juice in your eye and I m not saying it s the worst thing I m just saying it s bad . The worst thing is trying to get into a brand new CD . Am I right ? What has happened with the packaging of CDs ? These are angry angry people these CD packages . Open here is that sarcasm ? Are they mocking me open here ? I ve never seen this . I ve never seen it that thick before . And it s like are they trying to keep it fresh ? Why is it sealed in plastic ? And then you can t get into it so you re just slashing with scissors or a knife . That s how you have to get into anything now . Is it all the packaging now ? What if you re buying them for the first time ? </s> <s> How you supposed to get in there ? Batteries are packaged like they never want you to get in there . Thick , laminated plastic and thick cardboard and staples like from a staple gun . And what could happen to batteries ? And then try to buy a light bulb . Thin , thin , thin cardboard . Open on both ends . Oh , they ll be fine . Everything s all different now . The packaging , the way you open things , toilet paper . Have you tried to get into a public restroom and the toilet paper hasn t gotten started yet ? You re the first one there and you ve got to find the start of it . And then you can blow it first . Surely I ve gone around once or twice . And you go fast . Maybe the wind will open the flap . Maybe I m going the wrong way . And you go back . Then back to this way again . And then finally you find it and it s glued down . They re glue in the first flap down . So now you re trying to lift it . And only a quarter of an inch comes unglued . The rest stays glued . So now you re pulling and you ve got a five foot long quarter of an inch strip . That you just keep pulling . I don t want a streamer . I want toilet paper . This is no time to celebrate . Then you re trying to get it started . One hole , one , there s a groove out of one side . And then you just shove your finger across , wasting most of the role trying to start at a new , which never goes evenly . Then you just start clawing at it like a wild animal . Jesus , I just want toilet paper . God . I can just . . . What s happened to the toilet paper by the way in public bathrooms ? It s not even one ply anymore . Is it ? It s a sheer suggestion of what toilet paper used to be . It s in you window , a ghost . I think prosciutto . It s so thin . And then because it s so thin and it s on that huge cheese wheel size roll . It s like a spare tire roll of toilet paper . So the heaviness of the roll with the thinness of the paper trying to move it alone is just a . . . Please , if I could just have more than one . . . One . I just want . . . Please just give me two note one . I just . . . One . 15 minutes later you got 15 squares in your hand , which equal one ply . And then they re making things easier that don t need to be made easier . You know , these toilets that are flush and automatically now , which I ll decide when I m done . Because sometimes it just go off randomly . You re still sitting there . Wow ! How dare you ! </s> <s> And then they don t go off when you want them to . You re standing up , you re just staring at the toilet . You sit down and fake it out again . And then you ve got to wash your hands . You have no control over that either . You ve got to sink . It has to see your hands first underneath . And then it decides how much water you need also . It gives you a certain portion . You don t know how much you re going to get , so you re like a little raccoon under there . Just . . . And then it decides that s enough water and it s not . So you have to pull out and go pretend like your new hands going back in again . And the dryer you put your hands under there quickly like that . And all this is to avoid germs . And you walk over to that diseased , written door handle and open it up . Back to that bowl of mixed nuts , you re sharing it the bar . And then you re all paranoid because your friends are waiting at the bar even in the bathroom for half an hour . And you feel weird . You know , it s amazing how much time that we put thought into thinking about what other people are thinking about us . You know , when everybody else is just thinking about what we re thinking about them . You know ? We are so comfortable with that uncomfortable feeling that we just get so used to it . Anything , you know ? If somebody s talking to you in a tiny bit of moisture comes out and lands on your cheek . You know it s there . They certainly know it s there . And nobody acknowledges it . You just keep talking directly into each other s eyes acting like that didn t just happen . Waiting for them to glance away just for a second so you can do that . Why is it . . . Would that insult them if they saw us wipe that away that you don t want that there ? Why would you wipe my spittle away ? We re just anything makes us uncomfortable . If you re a wave to somebody , you re sure it s them . Oh , there s Nancy . What s not Nancy ? The weird stuff happening inside . It s really bad when you go out of your way to get their attention , isn t it ? Oh , look , there s Nancy . Nancy ! Nancy ! Nancy ! God ! Nancy ! That s why you re someone else . Get it look like Nancy ! Let s go , let s go ! They don t like Nancy ! Or if somebody s waving to you and you know you don t know them , but you wave back anyway . </s> <s> Or if you re walking down the street , good day for you too . Good self esteem day . You re happy with your outfit , happy with your hair . Feeling really good about yourself . It just takes that one tiny trip to just suck the coolness right out of you . Can t let that happen . As soon as that happens , we have to look back right away . Careful for the pebble I just tripped in there . Someone should put some orange cones . There s a pebble up ahead . Or are we going to denial ? I was just going to start running anyway . I didn t trip . Just going to run . I m running and I m done . That s all I needed . Stopped a time I shoe a block ago and I m back on schedule with that little jog . Like we re fooling people across the way . Oh , she tripped . No , she s running . I thought she tripped , but she s running . She stopped . She did trip . You tripped . She tripped . Did you ever walk into a plate glass window ? Two things are happening there . Pain and embarrassment . But pain takes a back seat to embarrassment , doesn t it ? No matter how much pain you re in , if people are laughing , you just laugh along with them . Oh , bam . I just slammed right into that thing . Isn t that funny ? It s so clean and shiny . Someone should put a sticker or a happy face or something . Isn t that funny ? Oh , my . Is that blood ? I m bleeding . Isn t that funny ? I m bleeding . Oh , my . Can you help me find my eye ? I lost my eye . I cannot find my eye . It could be as big as that . It could be as small as you re with somebody and they re singing a song that you love . And they sing lyrics you ve never sung before . Suddenly you realize you ve been singing the wrong words all along . You re like , does he have it ? That s what they re singing right there . Does he have it ? You re thinking to yourself , why have I been singing monkey hatchet ? How many people have heard me sing monkey hatchet ? We all have songs you don t know the words too . Some songs you don t even bother trying to learn the words because you assume nobody knows them . That are either Franklin s song , respect . That s been around a long time and we always get to that part . R E S P E C T , find out what it means to me . R E S P E C T . D G G D C T H O ! </s> <s> Suck it to me , suck it to me , suck it to me . I don t know . Certain songs are weird that songs are hits and then songs aren t hits . Respect , that s a song that you , of course , you d hear that and go , that s going to be a smash hit because it s about respect and who doesn t want to sing along to that . But certain songs , you know , that Peter Paul and Mary s song , if I had a hammer , that was a huge hit . I don t know why . I think that song was written for people who don t have hammers . Because before I had a hammer , I probably thought to myself , if I had a hammer , I would hammer in the morning . I d hammer in the evening . I d hammer all over this land if I had a hammer . Once you get a hammer , you find you don t hammer as much as you think you would . I love music . Music is so important , I think . It s so powerful . Now , you can be in one mood , one state of mind , you hear a song and it transports you , it changes your emotion just by hearing a song . And even with our ADD and our memory loss , you can hear a song that you loved in the fifth grade and remember every single word to it . That s how powerful music is . And certain songs , people respond differently to different music and because usually it tells a story that we relate to . And for me , mine is salt and pepper chup . That s a beautiful tale . Well , here I go , here I go . Here I go again , girls , what s my weakness ? Men . Okay , then , chillin , chillin . Mind in my business . You re salt , I looked around and I couldn t believe this . I m not aware I stand , my niece , my witness , the brother had it going on with some kind of , um , wicked , wicked , had to kick it . I m not shy , so I ask for the digits . A whole no , that don t make me see what I want slip slide to it swiftly . Felt it in my hips , so I dip back to my bag of tricks , then a flip for the tip , maybe want to do tricks on him .

I know the lyrics to that song , I know all the words , because it s an older song kind of , and it was on the radio all the time , and I used to drive along and I used to sing to it . </s> <s> And you didn t hear about road rage back then . People would drive and sing all the time . And that s happening less and less now . Now people are multitasking when they re driving . You know , they re driving and talking on the phone and putting on makeup and shaving , which makes me so nervous when I see that leg up on the dash . We re doing all these things to squeeze things together so we can save time . And I don t know about you , but I don t have any more time , I have less time . But let s just say we could save up a whole chunk of time and set it aside . You know what we do with it ? Nothing . Nothing at all . Isn t that the point to be able to do nothing at all ? But we re not guaranteed that later on chunk of time . All we have is here and now . And that s why procrastination feels so right . That s why procrastination is not the problem .

It makes the bourgeois and the rebels . So come on people now . Smile on your brother and everybody try to love one another . Because what the world needs now is love . Sweet love .

        "transcript": "<s> darker setups Thank you . Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Welcome to the Sydney Opera House . I ve always dreamed about saying that without the words going to take your coat . A couple of things before we start , turn off your mobile phones , don t do that thing of turn of the silence so you can still read text messages because I ll see you . All I see is your little face light up and blue . It s very off putting . And secondly , very importantly , there will be some swaying in the show . I make no apologies for that . I m from Scotland where Tourette s has seen as a gift . If you can conjugate the verb to fuck by the age of four , you re one of the chosen ones . So welcome to the show . This is the end , the very last gig of a six month tour of Australia after . Six months . Hey , thank you . I ve been . . . Couldn t have done it without you , yeah . It s been incredible . I ve been on tiny little planes to tiny places , tiny airports . You know there are some airports in Australia that really shouldn t bother with a baggage carousel . Just land , pop the boot , I ll get my bag . I flew into Mount Gambia , right ? Just a few weeks ago it was just me and one other guy on the flight . We still had to wait at the baggage carousel . For 20 minutes . I just thought that s come on . I m sure there was two baggage handlers in the back just going , nah , you . . . Oh , you let one go . Let one go . Funny ears , mate . Funny ears . I ve been to some pretty shit places , you know . I won t lie to you . Because everyone s got an opinion in Australia about where you re off to . If you see , I m off to Biden Bay for the weekend . Oh , bloody lovely up there , mate . Oh , you re bloody lovely , mate . Bloody booties . Bloody , bloody oceans . Bloody . . . Bloody sunshine , mate . You won t want a bloody life . That s for sure . You won t want a bloody life . But . . . But if you say . . . But if you say , for example , I m off to , I don t know , double . . . Oh , good fucking luck , mate . Good fucking luck . You ll fucking night it . And he was right . I did need it . I ve stayed in the motel in double . This is absolutely true . This is how shit it was . </s> <s> Because at the end of the day , you know , you accept that when you re travelling around regional Australia , you can t stay in a hill every night . Not that I would be . I m still Danny from the block . But . . . But . . . How that signified it , I don t know . But . . . But sometimes you re just going to have to stay in a motel , whatever . This motel in double , this is absolutely true . I went into the room , very sparse room . I just wanted to get a glass of cold water from the tap . And a cold tap wasn t working . So I phoned up reception . I said , the cold tap s not working . I just wanted to get a glass of cold water . And with that word of a lie , he said , well , fill it with hot water and let it fucking cool . Okay , thank you . Nice to have you guys . And the . . . Do you know on the fourth , on the fourth gig of this tour , it s been quite an eventful tour . The fourth gig of this tour , I fell off the stage , right ? Absolutely true . In a place called Ballarat . They ve got a huge big theatre in Ballarat , and an orchestra pit at the front , which no one told me about . And they ve put a . . . They put a safety net in the orchestra pit . Now , the drop is 12 feet . For some reason , they put the safety net at 11 feet . Which kind of makes the safety net no fucking good . And the stage is on a slope . It couldn t have been any more dangerous if it had been designed by Al Qaeda . And built by the first two little pigs . It was . . . It was . . . It was straw , and then there was another one that made his house of stick . And the wind came . Sorry . I have to go , because you have to . . . Why would two pigs build a theatre in Ballarat ? How would they pick up the straw with their homes ? I d done that now , how ? So . . . So this is absolutely true story . And I came out . . . It was that beginning you ve just seen with the stools , the backpipe , and . . . And the music stopped . Lights came on , blinding lights , writing my eyes , smoke everywhere . I couldn t see a thing . I just kept on walking . I m all over the park . Now , all the people in Ballarat , all the people in the theatre , seeing me getting closer and closer to the edge of the stage , they started going , whoa , whoa ! </s> <s> But I d never been there before . I thought it was some kind of weird Ballarat greeting , right ? So I started going , whoa , whoa , indeed . Whoa , whoa , whoa , and then fucking , whoa ! Oh , oh , man . Agony it was . Tour all the ligaments in my right arm . Don t sympathise . My old French teacher used to say to me , Danny Boy , if you re looking for sympathy , it s in the dictionary between shit and syphilis . Here s the one you ll use at work tomorrow morning , right ? Oh , the fix machine s broken . Well . But so , no , I was , this is true . So I m lying in the net , right ? A blackout for a few seconds . I mean , a lot of pain . A wake up . And at this point , my stage manager , he s come running onto the stage to see if I m okay . He s leaning down , he s saying , are you okay ? But the lights are still silhoueting him from the back . I just see the figure of a man leaning down . Are you okay ? He thought , fuck him in heaven . I wasn t in heaven . I was in Balorat . And to know what the amazing thing is , apparently I m not the first person to fall off that stage . I m the fifth . Five people before me have fallen off that stage , including popular children s TV entertainer , Humphrey B . Bayer . Do you know him ? I didn t know who he was , right ? So I came off stage , I m in agony , I m sitting down . One of the venue staff came up and said , Mike , I saw you fall off the . . . He said , you know what the first person , Mike , 10 years ago , Humphrey B . Bayer , did decide to . . . So I m thinking , oh , I don t know who the sky is , maybe he s a singer or a comedian . So I said , oh , what happened to him ? He said , oh , Mike , his fucking head came flying off . Are you sure ? Yeah , the fucking head , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , 髒 . What house is place allowed to operate ? Absolutely true , he came up on the thing in the head and into the net . 800 kids traumatized . Apparently they heard him say his first words that night . I don t think it was the ones they were expecting . But apart from a few near death experiences , it s been a very intriguing tour . And I ve learned an awful lot about Australia and this tour stuff . I didn t know . I ve kind of got addicted to those late night parliamentary sessions . You know the ones ? They re constant referencing to Mr . Speaker . Why do they do that ? Mr . Speaker , Mr . </s> <s> Speaker , Mr . Speaker , Mr . Speaker , I wonder , Mr . Speaker , if the right Honourable member , Mr . Speaker , is it a chance to read the report , Mr . Speaker , which I have in my hand , Mr . Speaker , the report from the Australian , no , no , no , the Australian Crown Drove , so is the Asian , Mr . Speaker , no , no question . Mr . Speaker , the report , which clearly stuts the Australian Crown production , Mr . Speaker , will decrease by , and oh , it won t . So I m 20 per se , Mr . Speaker , so I m 20 per se , Mr . Speaker , and all his mates and his side of the house go , what is that ? They re not saying anything . I ve turned up the TV as loud as it goes , they re just going , I ve turned up the TV as loud as it goes , they re just going , Now the other guy gets up , I have had a chance to read the report , I d have appreciated it if when he put it on my desk , he d also return my stiper , Mr . Speaker . So petty , isn t it ? It s great fun though . It s all my favourite Parliament in the world . They ve got the chance to see the Italian Parliament in session . The Italians have had , I think , 38 Governments since the end of the Second World War , and it s no wonder , because it gets very violent the Parliament . One guy will stand up to ask the Government a question , right ? What does the Government plan to do about investment in Italy next year ? And the Minister will get up , eh , fuck you , fucking fest ! You want to invest in these ? How about investing your mother ? My mother , I ll kill you , I ll kill you ! It s a guy being held back , whatever . Not an Italian river dance politician . Oh yeah , do you know what Italian , it s interesting how Italian men are viewed in the rest of the world . When you go to America and here in Australia , Italian men are seen very romantic men . As soon as you know the guys that turn up outside your door , the rose in the mouth , bottler Edwine , hear slick back . Bon John , no . And all you . . . Oh , hello ! I don t know if we re going to do that anyway . It s so much mist flirting gesture . But they do , they re not , I went to Italy last year , I was in Rome . And Italian men have the , Italian men have the strangest courtship rituals . They re almost quite sleazy , they ll stand outside the fountains . And if a good looking woman walks by at night , they re . </s> <s> . . Yes , all the Italian men in my head seem to have evolved from R2 D2 . Which is ironic , because when English men are chatting people up , they re more like C3PO aren t they ? Oh , marvellous , I say . Adance , how wonderful . Us Scots are more like tobacco . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! And that s the women I m talking about . Well , the most romantic men of Europe are the French for God s sake . They just ooze romance out of every poor , ah ! They love it . They do , you , you , if , when you meet a French couple , ask them how they met , they ve always got the most romantic story , you know . When , if you meet a French couple , ah , not , if you re keeping saying , if you meet a French , when you meet a French couple , you re not that fucking isolated here , are you ? Ah , what will they look like , Danny ? Will they come by bad ? When you meet a French couple , ask them how they met , they ve always got these wonderful romantic stories . It s like a film script . Yeah . We were both in a small bookshop in the Montmartre region of Paris . We re both reached for the same book at the same time . I said , oh , she said , ah ! And our aunts touched . I said , I see you are a fan of Renoir . She said , yeah , that , huh ? I said , then , have the book . It is your book . You can take it because you have such beautiful eyes and beautiful air and beautiful body . And she took the book and she walked out of the bookshop and she turned and she smiled . And she left and I thought , what ? Well , I m crazy ! That was the woman of my dreams and now she has gone , what am I crazy ? I must follow the girls or I ran out of the bookshop or ran . That s how we run in France when we are infatuated . I ran into the street her perfume ringered in the air . I could not find her , well , a fam , I m screaming , well , a fam , dammit , dammit . There was a lot of Australian politicians in Paris , that day . And I could not find her , I could not find the girl , but I m art to broken , as opposed to art to broken , I m a broken art and I go to the train station . I m going to throw myself in front of the train . And then I see her on the train pulling away from the station , that she is not pulling the train . The train is pulling away , but she is on the train , and I bang on the compartment , I say , shadar , shadar , and she sees me , and she runs to the back of the train , and will she make it , and she goes , it was a blind . And she jumps and I caught her . Something like that . The point is , French couples always have very romantic stories about how they met . </s> <s> English men don t have romantic stories about how they met their wife , do they ? I went in an art club in Stockport , I fell into a ditch and she threw up on me face . I was champion . I bought her a bag of chips and shadd her up against factory wall . I would be together 20 long years . I would be in a bunch of stores . I would be in a bunch of stores . I would be in a bunch of stores . I would be in a bunchylum , but I would be in a bunch of stores . I would be in a bunch of stores , but I would be in a bunch of stores . I would be in a bunch of stores . But no , I have learned an awful lot about Australia on this visit . To get back to their point , lots of things , cultural things . Do you know what ? And this is absolutely true , I didn t realise until this visit that your National Anthem You should have walks in Matilda , it s more ballad in Australian and make sure you think of Australia when you hear that banjo and once a jolly swag man . Camp down bar , a bill of ball . Oh , it s great . I m sure it s the second for us you have a problem with , eh ? Hey , down , down , came the jump buck . That s a sheep . Fucking half of you didn t know that . Oh , yeah , yeah , of course it is my . . . Down came the jump buck to drink from the waterhole , it s a lake . Up jump the swag man and grabbed him with glee . Glee ? Hmm , that s interesting . Never grabbed a prospective meal with glee before . Well , I know it s in the third verse . He drowns himself , he don t commit suicide if you ve only been caught stealing a sheep . Just giving you the facts . Now , I used to have walks in Matilda though , it s a nice , unnational anthem . It s more ballad in passionate and it makes you think of Australia . Or , the Scottish national anthem is very passionate . It s the flower of Scotland and it tells a story of Robert the Bruce s famous victory at the Battle of Bannockburn . Oh , flower of Scotland , when will we see your like again ? And it s the unnational anthem in the world that makes provision for people with Tourette s , which is also quite nice . In the chorus , unsteered against them . GENZTOU ! Proud Edward Zarmie Basta ! Uncendom homeward , fuck off ! God , GEN ! Oh , was that me , did I ? That s brilliant ! That s the thing about Scotland is we ve always chosen passion and resilience over beauty . And we don t mean no apologies for that either , because you look at our national symbol in Scotland . The Fistle . It s a weed . You kind of think to yourself , I wonder how we ended up with that . In the great garden centre of national symbols . Why the hell would you choose a weed ? </s> <s> The English chose the rose , didn t they ? Oh , would have the rose ! Yeah , the rose ! And then the Welsh come up , hello ! I am a Welsh man ! And I would like for my national emblem . And after it ! Well , have a laugh , well done ! Oh , you re at home ! And if he goes , he s a doctor ! All the countries arrive and the Irish turn up , you know ? Here we go . Diddy dee , potatoes ! It seems to work , you know ? The Irish turn up the other day . I don t know what this , what the hell is this ? It seems like a mandolin I had you guys with . I m a storyteller . And my story must be told . What would you like as your national symbol ? Ah , you know , I m a little bit of a man . What would you like as your national symbol ? Ah , you know , if the flower you want to know , count the letters down below . Fuck off ! Well , I m going to time for this , mate . Ah , okay , we ll have the shamrock . Because the shamrock is rare and mystical like the Irish . He he he he he he he . And off they go into the mist . Off they go into the mist . But my point is all the countries got their national symbol . I I think the Scots must have arrived right at the end of the day when everything had gone . You know , I who s it going ? Oh , Christ right , what have I got left ? Hmm , not a lot , eh ? Not a lot . What s that prickly , shitly looking thing ? Oh , you don t want that , sir , that s a thistle . It s actually a weed . We would actually about to throw it out . What ? Free ? We ll have the lot , thank you . No , it s a killer , sir , it s horrible . It s causing havoc in the Rose Garden . The Rose Garden ? Back him up , boys . Ha ha ha . Yes . Do you know what I read ? This is quite an embarrassing aspect of Scottish culture . I read recently that we in Scotland , according to the World Health Organization , or as they re known in Glasgow , who ? We now officially , we now officially in Scotland have the worst diet in the world . In the world , that includes African countries . Countries with no food at all . It s now better to have , and let me get this right , no food at all . And then Scottish food . Freedom ! She couldn t believe when I read that . It kind of reminded me when I was a kid . Because when I was a kid , if I didn t eat everything on my plate , I was thinking , Danny , there are kids in Africa who would give their right arm for what you ve left on that plate . I had no idea at the same time African mothers were telling their kids similar stories about us . </s> <s> You know , the kids going , I m hungry . Well , there are kids in Scotland chewing on a black pudding that would love to be as hungry as you . To know a black pudding is essentially a giant scab . It is . People always go weird when I say that . We have it for breakfast . How hard are we ? So that s the Scottish breakfast , is basically everything in the fridge at that time . And if they can sausage , eggs , beans , chips , burgers , crisps , don t care , bring out your dead . We ll have it . Ah ! Don t care , so long as it s deep fried . It s all the breakfast . The Scottish breakfast is an important message to the rest of the world . It says it doesn t matter what you plan to do to us today . It s not nearly as bad as what we ve just done to ourselves . It says a lot about us . It says a lot about us . You know , you look at the French breakfast . You know , it s just a croissant . That s all they have . It s a tiny croissant . And then I will have to lie down . Because I will be quite full after my later croissant . It s not a breakfast , that s a bit of pastry . We put that on top of a meat pie . It says a lot about the French , so the old croissant doesn t it ? It says we are flaky and a little bit gay . And this is who we are . Look at this . You know , the Spanish just have yogurt and a bit of fruit for breakfast . I suppose you don t want anything too heavy if you re off to bed in a couple of hours , do you ? I love the siesta . I wish we d thought of it . I like the Spanish siesta . But we re all tired at that time of the day . I love the fact that the Spanish workforce has got together at some point in history . In the middle of a board meeting , just one guy is going . Hey , the bath dion . Are you tired ? Are you tired ? Yes , I am tired . Very tired . Franco . Oh , see , see . How many people are tired ? Shall we just go to bed ? Ah , yes . One hour , fuck it . Two hours . We have four hours in bed . Actually , it s just as well we don t have a siesta in Scotland . We d have to get up and have another one of those breakfasts . Dead by the age of 24 . You know , the Swiss breakfast , that was the musely . That s what Swiss have of the breakfast . </s> <s> So , dust and raisins that you ve got . Have you ever tried eating that ? It just comes out of pot . Never enough moisture in it . Have you ever tried pouring milk into a bowl of musely ? The milk comes flying back out . It doesn t hit that protective dust shield . Fuck that . How typically Swiss is that ? Even the milk doesn t want to get involved . It s just a little . . . The Germans are the most interesting , of course , you know . Because the Germans , well , let s not generalize in Bavaria in Germany . They have liver for breakfast . Liver for breakfast . How Germanic is that ? I have just woken up . My eyes are barely open . They are vital organs . Bring me as a filtering gland of a dead beast . And I will eat it . And I m French now . I m a German living in France . I lost the accent but maintained my cultural breakfast identity . In fact , making it a liver croissant . It s just a little one . That ll happen quite a lot in my show . I started an accent . It just descends into French for no apparent reason . I do it all the time . I was in Edinburgh just before Christmas . And this French couple came up and asked me for directions to Edinburgh Castle . I don t know if you ve ever been in the situation . For no reason , I felt we need to reply with a slight French accent . In my head I was thinking , oh , this is going to help the guy . He said , do you know the way to the castle ? And I went , you have to go down there and you ll take a rat and you ll just keep going . And he said , oh , are you French ? Are we to French ? No ! Are you crazy ? I m Scottish . And why are you talking like me and doing this to your hands ? I don t know . You started it . You are scaring me . I m scaring myself . But anyway , the point is we have the worst diet in the world in Scotland . Fact . And who cares ? At the end of the day , these are parties . It makes up who you are , these things . No country can be perfect . You know , I d rather be known for having a bad diet than being known for some of the pretentious food you get nowadays . You know , I hate all that pretentious bullshit . He says , standing on the stage of the Sydney Uprising . Yes , I tire of pretension . Ah , the hypocrisy . No , but I wasn t quite a post restaurant in Sydney the other day . And , God , you know , the first thing the weight I did was he went to push in my chair . But when I was a kid , that was the beginning of one of the best practical jokes you could play in someone . </s> <s> Because he d go to sit there and he d just spread the word . So I couldn t get out of my head . He was going to put my chair and I was going , I . . . He said , sir , are you going to sit down ? Not until you fucking move away , pal . I ve seen this before , right ? Very well , sir . And then the first question he asked me was , yes , what kind of bread would you like with your meal ? I don t know , tip top . Have you got tip top ? Any of the sliced whites is fine . Kind of bread , you want me to ? What s that supposed to mean ? You know , the menu was stupidly over elaborate . Nowadays , you don t just get a piece of meat , do you ? Oh , no . You get the entire CV of the animal . Wild duck . What s a wild duck ? Is that going to come with sunglasses and a leather jacket ? Yeah , they re lucky . They cut me . Are you French ? Yes , I m French . They need to ask . The chicken , you know , the chicken on this menu is the one I got . Because the chicken s a chicken for God s sake . It was corn fed farm reared breast of chicken . Corn fed , well , I don t care about its childhood , I m about to eat it . Corn fed , farm reared , good at tennis . It s a fucking chicken . I mean , do you think the chicken knows its corn fed ? Are they there in the barn , sort of separated ? You know , corn fed chickens in one end . Green fed chickens in the other , off to KFC . All the corn fed chickens off the posh restaurant . And do like my corn . Are your Frenchies with French ? I love a billet full of corn for the corn fed chicken . And all the , you know , the green fed chickens having to watch this all look at . Oh , bloody greens , disgust , it s like chewing gravelish . God , love a bit of corn , I really need you . Just one bit of corn . Look at that guy there with his fancy clothes . I think he s French . Look at him there with his fancy clothes . His friends look , what guy ? What guy ? Hey , that guy there . I can t tell you , I mean , you re going that guy in your car . 5 , 000 chickens over there and you re going that guy , that guy , that guy . What are you talking about ? What s that guy ? Oh , right , I see what you mean . I ll count down , right ? </s> <s> I ll go three . Two . One , and it ll be that guy . Right , keep your eyes open to the camera . Right , three . Two , one . That guy . What , that guy there ? Get some of these jokes , I ll go nowhere . The point is the menu is stupidly over elaborate for God s sake , you know . And nothing s ever with anything nowadays . It s too simple that . Everything s got to be on a bed of , isn t it ? What is this tired food ? Wild duck on a bed of . . . . . . cuse cuse . What the fuck is Cuse cuse ? Hey , when I grew up , Cuse cuse is what you milked milked in the fields fields . You milked the Cuse cuse down , yes , I have , Mum . Go and stick a duck in the back . So what , you know . The point is we have the worst diet in the world in Scotland . You know , who cares , there s a lot of Scottish culture I m not massively proud of . But for every bit of that , there s a lot of Scottish culture I am proud of . I m very happy to have . Our drinking in Scotland is legendary . In fact , there s only one country in the world that comes close to us in drinking . And I m fucking looking at it . You know what ? So you can tell how much a country likes its drinking , by its reaction to last orders at the bar . It s true , isn t it ? If you go to let a bar in Paris , let s say Paris , I m going to end up there anyway . And that bell goes for last orders . Ding , ding , ding . The reaction is one of mild surprise . Oh , dear , oh , dear , that is last orders . Never mind , we should finish up our drinks . And when we ll go out into the moonlight . We will walk , Andy and Ann , it will be very beautiful . I will kiss you . And it s very polite , and civil . Good night , my friend , the barman . Good night , my friend , the customer . You re led to it , right ? That s how they walk in Paris at the end of the night . Like Elvis was sedable , paulzy . No , I don t know , I don t know about this too . Look . But that s Paris . Here , I tell you what I was in a pub in Brisbane about three weeks ago . The bell went for last orders . You go mental . Fuck and where are you going ? Fuck off , fuck off , you re a bastard . Bastard , that s what you are . A bastard . It s not even right . Look , I ve got one back a minute . What have you got back and where are you going ? The guy that rang the bell had to dock straight behind the bar . Ding , ding . I ve got children . </s> <s> Because no one ever wants to go home in Australia . That s another thing I ve learned . I don t want to go home now , mate . Oh , remember everything . And of course , last orders means you don t need to go . It means you can get one more drink . But you being Australian . We ll get two in , mate . It s the last one , we might as well , mate . Two . Back and right . Two , two , two . What s it , fuck off your having two ? Two , two , two . Two , two , two , two , two . Right . It s quite common to see a man in Australia at the end of the night in a pub with a drink in each hand . Got two ? It s fine . Sometimes they ve got a drink in between the two drinks . That s what the . . . Yeah . You wouldn t see that in Italy . You wouldn t see a man with a drink in each hand in a bar in Italy . Just two on . . . How would he talk ? You always need the one hand . But not you Australian . It s almost like you ve mastered the entire art of conversation and just the wee head . Did I mark his down ? John , have you met Barry ? Barry ? Barry ? John , John . John , Barry . It s almost like all Australian men have evolved from green fed chickens at some point . She s all right , and she ll that one there . Not her , her . Oh , God . There s nothing wrong with that . I like your drinking culture here because it makes me think of back home . There s something nicer about being in a pub where there s someone more drunk than you . Something quite comforting about that . So you all look at that fucking loser , are they ? It s always quite nice . My favourite drinking story from Scotland of late is just before Christmas , I was in a pub in Edinburgh , like an old man s pub , and I went into the men s toilets for a reason . That wasn t just browsing . And all three of the urinals were occupied , right ? So there was a queue . That s a queue . It was just one old guy in front of me who was very , very drunk , right ? And you could barely stand . Now the guy in the third urinal , he zipped up and went to move away , and he was laughing about something . And I could see what he was laughing about from where I was . Someone had written a bit of graffiti above his urinal on the tile . Express lane only , they d written . Five beers or less , right ? Not a bad guy . So then I sat the old guy , that s free now mate , and he went , oh , thank you , thank you very much . </s> <s> And he stumbled over to this , absolutely , stumbled over to this urinal . And he s thinking , look , red this and went off a fuck shake . When did that go in , Jim ? You two , honey up . No , I can t . Anyway , yes , let s get back to it . So last orders goes , and this bar in Brisbane was in three weeks ago . And this guy , of course , went to the bar to get around in . And it s got a huge big round he got . And the guy said , things didn t use a tray or a waitress , of course not , mate . Not French . And he s huge big round , and he , the concentration , with which , because first we only checked where he needed to go , right ? I ve got a day in here , I have a day here , up on top of that , that s what , that s what , that s what , that s what , that s what , that s what . Too easy mate . And he , and he , the concentration was incredible . Just brought , let s get you a little beauty time . Come on , not so easy . And it was a very busy bar , so he had to squeeze in between people . But the , it was like a majestic navigation . Just there , there . And then , I tell you what it was like , it was like an Australian Thai Chi . And then he got to his table , right ? He got to his table , and he put all the drinks down . As soon as they hit the table , we quickly lick up the skull . And all his mates were like , Clayton ! And one of his mates tried to spoil it by saying , mate , sorry , the ruined things , but you forgot my crowning . And with the smuggest grin in the world , he went , oh , did I ? Let s just say what we re not going to do . So the most horrible moment in a pub is when they throw all the lights up , isn t it ? Why did they do that ? To signify the actual end of the evening . You ve been a good customer , you don t deserve that . All it does illuminate the full horror of your situation , doesn t it ? Lights go up , and we re fuck , have I been talking to a pool queue for 20 minutes ? I didn t know one thing could tell in me . And then , someone will suggest going back to theirs for a drink . And that s another option , isn t it ? Oh , the night were last forever . It s amazing , isn t it ? When people invite you back to theirs like one , two o clock in the morning , everyone s got spirits , but no one s ever got any mixer . Or not the mixer that you d usually have with that spirit . </s> <s> But you become your own cocktail waiter at that time . It s amazing how much less discerning we become . Six hours previously , we were in a wine bar after work , saying , a glass of white wine , not a shardonnay . Now , I will not drink a shardonnay . Six hours later , you re crawling around someone s kitchen . Any concoction will do . Anyone for gin and chocolate milk ? Anyone for that ? How s that going ? Yeah ? Oh , you know , I ll give it a go . Yeah , yeah . Oh , that s quite nice . Yeah , I m not drinking that next time I m out . Someone always says that , I m not drinking that next time I m out . Like you would , like the next day you re sitting in the pub and , right , eight beers , is it Lads ? Actually . All of a gin and chocolate milk , please , Barry . Ah , it s so good fun . You know , the only thing that probably differs between us and you lot when it comes to drinking culture is the hangover . The hangover is a unique Scottish thing . You know , you don t get an Italian man waking up . Oh , I feel like shit . What happened last night ? I remember nothing . Why is there kebab me , dull over my bed ? I don t know . And you lot , this is a difference . You look kind of fight the hangover a wee bit . You know , you go , ah , far , I feel like shit . Right , I m going to have a smoothie , then go out for a rant . Coming for a rant , Danny . Why are we being chased ? Oh , possible reason , could you have to go for a run ? You ve got a hangover , man . Take the punishment . That s what we do in Scotland . We accept a hangover . It s like an old friend coming to visit . We wake up , ah , kick our shoes off . The light flooding in from the television . Oh shit , and there s always a moment of denial . I only had a drink . Can I have two , maybe two or three , but no more than that . Chocolate milk , right ? Chocolate milk , I don t remember drinking chocolate milk . And then you know you ve got to get up , and it s always done very gingerly . You get up , and you just like to crawl , you see , you like to feel the earth beneath you . And you crawl out the bedroom into the kitchen , rise up slowly , open the fridge door , and cook everything in it . And the cycle of our day starts all over again . And it s a great way to live . And I wouldn t change it for the world . And there s an awful lot of Scottish culture , I wouldn t change . </s> <s> And , ah , and do you know , here s another thing that I m really proud of about Scotland . No dangerous animals . None at all . And there s nothing there that s going to give you any problems whatsoever . Because here , I ve been here for six months , remember , traveling around the middle of Australia , I ve woke up some more , and you have to brush turtles off your face . Kick kangaroos out your bed . And they all look at you as if to say , not so friendly in the morning , are we , Danny ? Chocolate milk . But it s weird that we don t have anything like that in Scotland . It s almost like when Noah was traveling around the world in his ark , if you believe that story . It s almost like he never went back to Scotland for the drop off . Or possibly never went there on the first place . If you think about Noah s message , it wouldn t have been greatly received in Scotland , wouldn t it ? Noah turning up . Hello , Scotland . I am Noah . All right , Noah , how s it going ? Yes , good . I m a messenger of God . Oh , what s he got to say ? This is exciting . I need two of all of your animals . Uh huh . Carry on . Well , there is to be 40 days and nights of rain . Geno , you re in Scotland , Noah . We re on 55 at the moment . It s not a great prediction , is it ? Geno , he was thinking the day , if I d been Noah , I d have been a lot more discerning about who got on that ark and who didn t . Wouldn t you ? I mean , he had the chance to wipe out entire species of animals in that flood by just not letting them on the ark . If I d been Noah and seen two rats coming up that plank , I d have gone . And where d you think you were going ? Oh , we re going on the . . . Make myself laugh . Go on on the ark , cos . . . I ve got an invite . Rat plus one , that s that guy there . And , you know , I don t give a shit . What you ve got ? Piss off , eh ? Take the mosquitoes with you . But our entire species . . . . . . will be wiped out in the flood . Yeah , boom , fucking hoon . You re a rat . You should have thought about that before you killed half a Europe in the play . Admittedly not for another 1400 years . Look , I m a visionary . That s how I got this job , yeah ? </s> <s> Give me a break . I must have been tough being Noah , all those animals coming on . You know , not knowing who s who . . . . . . died the do eye . What are you ? I don t know . Anteida ? Anteida . Oh , okay , let s have a look . Yes , too , anteida . Oh , hang on , I need a word with you , too . Now , as you know , there s only two of everything on that shit . Don t look all innocent . If they go missing , I fucking know it s you two . Knows he s cleaned the area . Who anted his slope enough ? Nice going dickhead , eh ? The hell d you tell me what anted us for ? Just call me a dickhead , look at us . We re both dickheads . And so many animals look the same . How does Noah know who s been on the art and who hasn t been on the two things coming up here ? Hello there . Noah , here we go . Noah s to some . . . sorry . I ve just put two of you guys on . It s a very strict door policy . It s only two of every animal . Oh , no , those guys , no , they weren t us . They were moosh , eh ? We re stagged . Noah , panic . Oh , sorry . I didn t realize so many animals looked the same , but are different . On you go , someone s going to get the black and white horses . Tell them they can come back . It s one of my favourite biblical stories , Noah s Ark . You know one of the Bible stories that always confuses me is the last supper . Because according to the book I read , Jesus stood up at the beginning of the meal . At the beginning of the meal . And he announced his disciples . He said , tomorrow he said , one of you will betray me . I can t . Born up a date . I just kind of feel after that . The meal must have got a wee bit awkward , you know ? You know , all the thing , you know , crooked , that was a bit of a . . . It was a bit of a bombshell , wasn t it ? Passive potatoes . Who do you think it was ? What ? Who do you think betrayed , you know , Jesus ? I don t know . Yeah , me neither . It s a nice new suit . Judas has got on , no ? I imagine the last supper was quite an uncomfortable meal anyway , you know ? You know , Jesus broke bread at the last supper and said , this is to represent the breaking of my bones . Port red wine said , this is to represent the spilling of my blood . I m not a fussy eater , but I d have probably gone , you know , I m not that hungry anymore . I m sure as fucking touch in the meatballs . Sorry to anyone who s taking a rest . You have to be pretty careful these days when you do a religious joke . </s> <s> I got a death threat last year . Yeah , first ever death threat . I say first ever , I m not hoping for more , you know ? Oh , that s a shine , past the scissors and newspaper . No , I got a . . . I didn t get a death threat . Well , because you accept that sometimes , you know , you say things that people aren t going to like . And , you know , on this tour , in fact , I got a note backstage . I did a gig in Townsville and this guy left a note in my dressing room and said , you re going to hell . I thought I m in fucking Townsville . What time does the bus leave ? But it was a religious . . . I got this religious related death threat because I d look , I m not a religious person , right ? But I have no problem with anyone . It is religious , live and let live and all that . And , in fact , the only reason I m not religious is probably because of church . No , Sirius , let me explain . I just don t like all the paraphernalia of church . Do you remember when your kid church hymns ? What was all that about ? People say , sing the church hymn , Danny . Lifting and rejoiceful . It ll bring you closer to the Lord . You got a Yeshua . Have you read the lyrics here ? The subtext of every single church hymn was always the same . That God is great and we are all shit . Didn t uplift me that one . God is great and we are shit . God is great and we are shit and God is great but we are shit . That was the worst thing , wasn t it ? Do you think the guy that wrote the music and the guy that wrote the lyrics ever collaborated on ? It s always that really uncomfortable moment when you got to the end of a verse . And it d just be one last bit of organ left . You go , shit , I ve got eight words to fit into that . And he came down from heaven to work to save his office , great . Organ players going , this is all I ve got , pal , sorry , that s it . Sometimes it was the opposite problem , wasn t it ? Remember that when you got to the end of the verse and it was just one last word left . And but a huge bit of organ . And you re auntie is great . Organ players loving it , isn t it ? I tell you what were fun when I was a kid . Christmas carols . Because remember when you sang them in school , there d always be one group of kids that would sing way ahead of the rest . </s> <s> You only sang it once a year so you didn t quite know how it went . There d always be one group of kids singing way ahead of the rest and then have to repeat the last bit again . Yeah . I weigh in , I mean , you re no crib for a bed , shit , for a bed . So . . . Did difficult to Christmas carol that anyway , wasn t it , away in the manger ? Because remember if you started too high in the first bit , you d know what to go . I weigh in , I mean , you re . . . And then you d overcompensate , I m not going to have to me again , that was embarrassing . So you got , but you didn t know it went down again after that . The little Lord Jesus . It s all . . . Oh dear . But anyways , yes , I would go to church if they just changed a few things . Put in an armed chair , I ll go . I can t sit in a church pew for any length of time , can you ? Who the hell designed that ? Six feet for your back , two inches for your arse . Who didn t think was coming to church , giraffes ? You sit there , your legs cramped up against the pew in front . I ve sat in church before , looked up at the guy nailed to the cross and thought , I think it s to stretch his legs out . Yep , you guessed it , that s the guy who got the death threat for it . It is a true story , I didn t get a death threat in a place called Born with an England . It s a very conservative , small seaside town in England . I came out the gig and everyone had gone and I was just walking back to my hotel . And this guy appeared at the shadows . All the bad people appeared at the shadows . He said , can I get an autograph ? Yeah , you know , it s all outside . And he grabbed me by the shirt and he pulled me right into it . I said , listen mate , I don t know what you ve heard , but it s just autographs I do . You could say he grabbed me with a glee . And he said , if you ever make religious jokes in Born with again , I ll stab you in the neck . And that s a promise . As if he needed that bit at the end . Oh , I really stabbed me in the neck , heard it mate , Jesus , change the record . It s all that s a promise , oh shit . Now , it s quite scary when that happens and obviously you just have to react instinctively . </s> <s> And all I could think of when he said , I ll stab you in the neck and that s a promise was , oh not the neck . I like my neck . I lose my neck . So I actually said to this guy when he said that , I said , mm hmm . Does it have to be the neck ? As if we could barter over my own death . It worked , he let go of me , went , you re weird . Wait , you forgot your autograph . It s weird when you re in those confrontational situations , isn t it ? If you never quite know what to say , I had another sort of confrontation , but 12 months ago in London , I was involved in the car crash . Well , it was my fault , basically , I bumped into a guy s car in front and it was a kid as well . I was like a 19 20 year old kid in this very flashy car with a hood down , you know , 18 exhaust pipes . You can blue neon lights in the undercarriage . What are you driving or landing , you dick ? And he s driving along the south London , so it was only 25 miles an hour and he s there and he s , you know , his music s , you know . Mm mm . Mm mm . I don t like that . What the hell is you hear that in every single pub or nightclub nowadays , don t you open the door ? Mm mm . Sounds like a cat trying to be sick . That s what it s saying , it s like , mm mm . So when I walk into my living room , my cat s doing , mm mm . I don t go . I shit myself . Get out of here ! I m on the door of the window ! Oh God ! I m on that Jesus Christ . Shit , that was close . I know , there s so slight cats as well , aren t they ? Because ten minutes later , a nice , a feminine cat comes back , doesn t it ? Yeah . Oh , it s my cat . I love my cat . Open the door and the thing comes in and you go , you re right now . I m alright , is that what you said ? What the fuck was all that about ? Shut the me out like that . Smack my face on that . Dustbint , did you know that was near ? Fucking right into it . I m alright . Look at that . Grazed out on the wall of trying to get round , you see ? You don t believe all that cat s always landing on a feet shit , do you ? Look at that . I m alright , I can t even lick that bit . I m so sorry , I thought you were going to be sick . That s great , that s charming . Would you do that to one of the kids if they were going to be sick ? </s> <s> See , when dogs are sick , they don t make a big song and dance about it , do they ? Dogs are almost apologetic when they re sick . Oh God , I hope no one saw that . Oh you did see it , okay . Oh no , don t clean it up , I ll lick it up . Alright , no I m happy to . I ll get some of that cat sick as well if it s going . Alright , oh no , happy to . Anything to get the taste of my balls out my mouth out . Anyways . Alright , what was that ? Yes , so I had a car crash , right ? I bumped into this 19 year old kid driving his flashy car , pit into the back of him . Now , it was my fault , I wasn t really paying attention , I was judging distance from vibrational loan . And he must have gotten a change of serious something , so I hit into the back of him . But there was no major damage , his fourth exhaust pipe fell off . Now I got off , I got out of my car , right ? Ready to do the sensible thing , I m very sorry about that , I ll pay for the damage . But the aggressive nature with which there s the confrontational nature with which his kid got out of his car . He goes out , can t go straight back , you want that ? What s he doing ? Look , he just came up with a toilet where the hand dryer wasn t working . I said , you alright , do I fucking look alright ? No , you don t . You look too within about 10 feet , at this point I thought , maybe I ve genuinely disabled this bit . I thought I didn t hit him that hard , did I ? And then he got to like two feet to me , right ? And he s . . . Didn t know any better , I d think he d been grain fed . And he pushed me this kid , right ? Pushed . And I would fly back against the bonnet of my car , and I d get up , brush myself down , and all the Scottish blood rose to my chest . And then the strongest broke I could muster , I said . I d like to see you try that again . And he did . He took it as less of a threat , more of an invitation . And he pushed me , and the second time he pushed me , I was weird . The second time he pushed me , I yelled out a word . A word I don t think I ve yelled out for 20 years . I don t know where it came from , from the darkest recesses of my childhood . He pushed me in the middle of London , in the middle of the afternoon . </s> <s> I yelled out , man ! And it worked , he went , oh , yo , man , man , man , that one I don t want to trouble , man . It was weird , it s very powerful word at that . Very powerful . You know , remember when you were a kid , there was three different calls for your mum . And each one would tell her what level of panic you were at . Because dad was just , dad was , see , when you call for your dad , it s just one syllable . Dad , dad , one syllable . Because it s a business call , isn t it ? I ve broken my bike , dad . Mum , there s always more emotion in that call . I ve pissed my bed , man ! You don t call dad if you ve pissed your bed . I ve pissed my bed , dad , what the fuck did you do that for ? Where s your mum ? Mum ! You ve got to call your mum . She knows what to do , she can handle it . But three different calls for your mum . Each one would tell her what level of panic you were at . First call . Mum ! That s your first call . But if you don t hear back for any reason , well , that s got to get louder . And slightly quizzical , as in , I don t know why you haven t replied . First call . Mum ! I can call . Mum ! And then the third call . And the third call . It s the whole nature of the call changes . It s a slight intonation change , but it says a whole new level of panic has opened up here . Because you shouldn t have to use the third call . I should have heard back by now . Listen to the thing , he got the first one . Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! You hear that ? Are you sure ? Mum ! That s where the hell are you ? I m nine , I can t do this on my own . Mum ! And if you need it at the fourth call , well , that s just , that s just anarchy . I d say with a call becomes less of a call , more of a cry . Mum ! Mum ! Still nothing . Mum ! Still nothing . Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! Mum ! And eventually she ll go back . What is it ? Mum ! Mum ! I can t find Dad ! Fulks , you ve been an absolutely cracking lullaby . Thank you very , very much for coming along tonight . And I ll see you all again soon . Thank you very much . Thanks , guys . See you next time . Thank you . you </s>"

Your mother and I used to look for white powder and envelopes . We went online , we did lines , my friend ! Yes , so , yeah , and there were ninjas on the fucking lawn trying to kill us ! And now , there are people trying to kill us , and that s why I bought a gas mask , I thought , I ll be safe , I ve got a gas mask , I m gonna wait a minute .

Come on , hazmat suits are all leaving . They re putting them underground . They re protecting him . But as the congressman walk out there , go , but the rest of you go about your lives . Everything is perfectly okay . We ll be miles away . It s like when you go to the dentist and he puts a little bedbub over your balls . He walks behind concrete going . You ll be fine . But how can you tell if Congress is sick ? It s not even living dead anyway . They re all over the old old senators like Strom and Jesse going , you know , you know the Confederate flag is just a symbol of states , right ? Yeah , the swastik is just a Tibetan good luck charm . </s> <s> Now , come on . Come on out of here now . It s scary . I have one thing . When did Ted Kennedy become job of the hut ? He s huge ! You re a Kennedy not a macy s day float . Come on . Bring him down . We re voting . Step away , boy . I said no to the Christmas cream . Yes . And Congress recently approved the covert plan to assassinate Saddam Hussein . So what they ve done is publicly approved the secret plan to assassinate Hussein . I wonder if he knows . Ah , but I do know . I know this one thing . I know there s a cure for one of the bioterrorism that they send at us . I know there s one . And it lies within key fridges . I know that . He s the only man in the planet who can go and freaks . All right . Hey , doesn t go with my E . Cola . The fuck ? Keith is the only man who can make the Osborne s look fucking homage . He s insane . I ve seen Keith go to a drug deal and drug deal is going . . . I m out . Man , I m sorry . I have nothing left . Supposedly he goes to Switzerland and changes his blood . Not like one pint , but like a fucking Chevrolet . All of it . I just want to know who gets his blood . Some old Swiss man s going , HIGHLY ! This kind of going too all you bitch ! We ve got to pay for mixed beers ! Come on ! Because I know this . I know that we may all be dead and gone . Keith will still be there with five cockroaches . Keith will go , you know , I smoke your uncle . Did you know that ? Fucking crazy .

Oh , man , I . . . I don t know where . I don t know when , but something awful is going to happen . And definitely don t marry that fat man he only wants you 40 money girl . People are suing Mr . Cleo for fraud and when fucking dark ! What do you want ? What do you want ? A blind jarocard before you go , ah ha ! First of all , if she s a psychic , why does she need a fucking phone number ? Number one . Number two , that fat , you know , that s to make an accent good . Or don t know it . If she was a real psychic , she d be like those Louise . </s> <s> And that ! You got to pop your ass up so they can put up a place for you back . Come on now ! I m saying it s like buying haircare products from Cher . She s wearing a wig , you idiot ! Here s what you have to do . You have to take that little abdominal thing to help you lose weight while it shocks your fat ass sitting watching TV . I m getting six pack Arabs by knocking my testicles around . No , what you do is you strap that to your head and say , Hey , well not bad . Stupid chick for no reason . There you go ! God ! Peace of girl ! Because now , man , we are in trouble times , you know . When it initially happened , I thought the statue of Liberty would change . Instead of giving it a tired , you d hear the baseball back like , You want to be a peace of mind ! That s when it happened . There was hardcore security . New York , you had hardcore security stopping people in the way in the tunnels in Washington . There were an AFA teams flying an air cover everywhere in San Francisco . Not so hardcore security . Gold and gate bridge at one end . There s a Hummer , and I m talking about the car . People going , really ? Now , what ? One Hummer here , two National Guardsmen , at the other end of the bridge , another Hummer , two National Guardsmen . Problem is , the Hummer and the National Guardsmen are in jungle camouflage . For those who ve never been to San Francisco , the bridge is probably orange . So I feel like going , be very , very quiet . We re working for a table , is . No ! And , what ? Airports Security , remember before all this happened ? It was like , okay , get on the plane . Come on , get on the plane . Oh no , no , no , no , no , no , no , it s it . Oh , that s a gun . Okay , get on the plane . You could carry a four inch plane on a plane . That s about that long . Now , you can t even carry a mail clipper on a plane . I ll be afraid you re gonna go , all right ! Give me the plan of the bridge loses a cuticle . I ve got a new file . I could be irritating . And if you have a stake or any piece of meat , they don t give you a knife . So it s like quest for fire flight . Sir , you re making a lot of noise . The Hindu man in the back is going hold him more , hire , hold it here . Don t be afraid to make use your hands . Because now when you go to airport security , it s tight . You go to the middle of the tech room , if you re heavily pierced like some of my friends , it s like , take out your keys , the chip of the iceberg . Bleh ! Bleh ! You re up here . </s> <s> For those playing the home game , this is called a Prince Albert . And I m sure that was his last wish . I m sure Albert said , Victoria , I m dying . I want you to name a museum , a performance hall , and a boat through the cock after me . That will be a Victoria s secret . Go , my darling ! Sir , little thumbs to people like that in Little Aino Floss . Go , go , go , my dear . And I m talking pierced , or heavily pierced , not like , Britney Spears . I m a virgin , yeah , Michael Jackson s the father . Move on , now ! I m talking like a hoops through your nipple . You know , lady , I get that . I m guessing . Look , see ! Just the kind of the way your clothes are kind of like . . . You know , when you have a big hoops for your nipple , what are you gonna do ? Tie up a pony ? No ! You have two hoops through the nipples and go , here s an hurt house , here s an hurt , whatever you want ! A towel down here , take a watch out , fun ! But the most interesting thing is when you see a girl with a boat through a tongue , and I went , what did you do that ? To an henster , such you assimilation ! Nothing dies , my boyfriend crazy , like the few , of course steel on his hat rods . But the problem is I end up knocking out all my keys and living in a tree with a man named Bubba . That s the trade off my darling . You know , you get to tattoo the barbed wire now in the 18 and by the time you re 80 , it s fucking big offense . And the dog now , you get it now and by the time you re 80 , she turns into Margaret Hamilton and goes , Oh , and I built it ! Here s what you want to do , here s some fun stuff . When I was growing up I didn t have playboy or penthouse , sad for me , but I had an extra geographic and the girls had got me crazy , oh yeah ! You know the ones with the slicky neck on , bagami , name , name , name , name , name . Do that ! Drive your parents crazy when you come down the stairs , going , gave them a neck , gave them a neck . Or do the fool you banky go , Ma , dad ? It s a source , 3D plan ! And you can take out the plate and jump rope with your lower lip . How fun ! What s cramical ? Shit ! Because . . . Oh ! Union guys , go , don t touch them , Mr . Williams !

Do it as soon as the season comes out and goes , Ladies and gentlemen , before we board Flight 5 , we re just going to do a few random bag chicks . These are totally random . I m just going to read off a few names . Hasn t been seen ? I came in late . Haven t been fucked . Judy Smith ? 14 Arabs in a blonde ? Every black man and every Hispanic man in the room is going , Thank you , God ! All black , yes , we re off the list , motherfucker , yeah ! Yeah , I did ! May it s going to be fucking with you now , hubby ! You better let it go , totally ! And sure , the train makes it up , they re ticked and leaning needles away from the 85 year old lady . Why ? Because I m going to knit an affant , give them to me ! And the five year old kid , they re panning him down , he s going , What are you doing ? You re not a priest , let go of me ! I see ! So you ve had a problem too , I guess ! Father Pat s little private patent chest like a game boy , good game , good game ! Wash up to me , really wash up ! It s amazing that you had catch them and wasn t there enough to catch them , but they had the divine witness protection program . Now find the priest , here s the panel , here s the priest , find the panel , find the priest , find the panel , find the panel , find the panel , everyone around !

It s a problem for these little things of sharp color , if they go near a kid , it s like , you know what I mean ? Tomini , I think , no , look at me ! Or the automated confessional , could be fun ! If this is a penal sin , press one ! If this is a carnal sin , press two ! </s> <s> If this is Cardinal Law , please stay on the line ! Because you have to remember , it s not just a sin , it s a felony ! So we have to keep track ! Now , we have one other thing ! Now , no , right now it s up there , they re watching high Mr . Ant Coffee ! We are now under the offices of Hongland Security . Tom Ridge will come out every 12th and go , today s a blue day , no orange ! Red ! And that d be very careful picking that name , Hongland Security ! You couldn t stay fatherland because a lot of old Germans are going , that s a good one ! But Hongland Security sounds like home front security , which was England during World War II , old men with pitchforks and colostomy bags defending England ! There they were , I captured Rudolph as personally , I threw my colostomy bag covered him in shite and said , did all that fucker you fucker , get out ! Lay around it ! And I also find out now that Winston Churchill , one of the greatest oruses of all time , may have been so fucked up on Konyak and Champaign , that he didn t do some of his great speeches , they were done by a man from the BBC , who also did Winnie the Pooh . We will fight him on the beaches , in the air , on the land , E R and Tigger ! And he was fighting against Hitler , a man who recently a book declared was a homosexual and I always thought this was a clue ! That in the leather and the dancing ! But ! We are now finding ourselves once again drawn to England . During this trouble time , as Tony Blair , a newt in liberal over here , George W . Bush , compassionate conservative . I don t know what that is , sounds kind of like a Volvo over the gun rack . But ! Over here , Tony Blair , a man who must address the House of Commons , which is like Congress with a two drink minimum , crazy place ! I believe my worthy opponents are Sakhos ! Shite ! Bullock you bastard ! Fuck you ! What someone removed is a stature from the chamber ! Here she goes ! But it was Tony who said , this heinous incident has brought us to the edge of oblivion , but our civilisation shall endure , and there s four W going , shit , I can t even spell it ! Hey !

And notice , he s my friend s . W doesn t speak while Cheney s drinking water , check that shit out . That s why baby ! When everything went down they put W out there , but they protected Cheney ! Remember that Cheney , he had an NGO plastic ! Most people wait till the kind of heals , he was like , I m perfectly fine ! I m okay ! There s Ashcroft in the back when you work the RMS , you asshole , work the RMS ! Folks , here s the member ! Here s the drill , if you remember , John Ashcroft is a man who lost to a dead man in Missouri . I forgot that choices in Missouri were John Ashcroft , dead man . And people in Missouri went , I m sorry , but I m sorry John , the dead man scares me less than you do . So , I m gonna know it ! Here s the drill for me ! No , it s strange , but I know this doesn t scare me the W Wave that Stevie Wonder , that s okay . That s okay ! Stevie s only been blind since birth ! There s W Won ! Stevie ! Even Stevie Wonder s gone , something motherfucker waive and at me ! No , there ! Does he think I m looking for him ? No , no ! What scares me is the W almost died from a fucking petrol !

We have moved rubble from here to here . Grote in the upper right hand corner , possible member of the Taliban , or Comtobine , we are not sure ! We did fire the 100 million Christmas Lepus ass and worse the Tesla . Operation extreme redundancy is carrying on . Now , then we started to drop bombs ! Food ! Food ! Here s the fun part . Some of the bombs were little yellow bombs , and the food packages were little yellow packages . So now you re playing Survivor the Real Game . It s like , okay , Bob , I was here yesterday . I m gonna go for this one today ! And what was in those packages ? Pop Tarts , peanut butter , and all you need is a honey baked tamer . You got a redneck Christmas . But . . . You dropped the honey baked tam on the Muslim Padmunk ? Shhh ! Eat it ! Why are we dropping pop Tarts and peanut butter on Afghanistan ? Number one , it tastes the shit low better than dirt . Yes . Number two , and more importantly , very difficult to have a cold to chew hot with a mouthful of peanut butter . Secondly , or thirdly , for those keeping track ? Afghanistan is a hashish spoken culture . And anyone who s ever been a friend of the hookah will go . . . Pop Tarts . Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah ! Shall I look at the oven , lava ? Yes ! Got milk ? Can we get some ? Because what are we trying to do ? We re trying to win hot semons . How do we do that ? Do we build a big amusement park called Muslim Mountain with Gaddafi Duck ? No .

He tries to cut off your clitters , make you a bivy doll , you grab a knife and say , I m about to die ! Don t make me go cobra , I will go Oprah on your ass . Don t make me ! Because what are we dealing with ? We re dealing with fundamentalists . They are not trying to hide your character , needle point . And if you re ever in Amish country and see a man , Lizard and Barry and the Horses S , that s a mechanic . Remember that . What ? Who are we looking for ? We are looking for some of Bin Laden , one of 52 children , even Freud would say , he has vicious . What does he look like without the beard ? How it s turned , mupper s strison ? I don t know , I don t care . I know this . He has a six foot five Arab on dialysis . Why is that so fucking hard to find ? Oh , that looks like it ! Look for somebody attached to their luggage ! Try this ! I also know one thing . When you see the tapes of him , you see a psychopath . Very calmly talking about all the things . Wait a minute , we have some of our own . Kier or Kaczynski sitting around with nothing to do . Ted s played a beautiful mind in the home game . You give Ted a mailing list and some tools ? You said , two of these people have been bad . He goes , are they bad ? Oh , very bad ! I just need a few things . I just want a few things . Oh , I know you do . Here you go . Or maybe we get Charles Manson .

Charles , what would you do if you got out ? </s> <s> I d kill everybody ! Whoopsy ! Because what do we deal with ? One of the fundamental things is in a jihad . It sounds like a country western term . Jihad ! But if you re in a jihad , you kill an infidel , which I m said to say is all of us . And you yourself die . You go to heaven and you re greeted by 71 dark haired virgins . Now , anyone who s ever been with one virgins going , I don t know . For my talent , torture . No , no , no , no , no . Recently , as an article in New York Times , the Koran scholar said the actual translation is not 71 dark haired virgins , but 71 crystal clear reasons . It s like difference in interpretation , really ? That s very sad . It s like finding out how shalt not kill is . Now , shalt not wear a guilt . And the scholars are going , suck off ! No , imagine some guy blows himself up , goes to the gates of heaven saying , where are my bitches ? Hear your reasons ? Or 71 Virgins going , you got a pretty man . We re in a line ! One day , we get the sum of bin Laden and goes to the gates of heaven . There s George Washington waiting , going , how dare you defile that which we create in such a violent on his ass . 70 other members of the continental Congress come down and start giggling the shit out of them . And then he s going , what does this word emergency ? 71 Virgins , you asshole ! Get out of here , asshole ! Get out of here , asshole ! I must go to Jesus Christ ! Where is Jesus Christ ? From St . Peter s got a Jesus , did you call the cab ? Come here ! Aha ! Yes ! I could have found it in the PC ! We crossed the politically correct line . It was okay to beat the shit out of them , but don t do the ethnic joke . How Buddhist of you ? Everyone , they distorted the two Buddhists . What would Buddha do ? Nothing . What does the Buddhist terrorist do ? It goes in the middle of the street , takes the gas , self barbecues . People killing each other in the name of God are going , this fuck are you doing ? Making you deal with your shit ? Because I don t understand the whole fundamentalist thing . You see , I m an episcopal that s Catholic light . It s kind of like extreme religion , half the guilt . It s frightening . You know , Catholics have confession , episcopals have . Thanksgiving your dad has a couple of genitalics . I never loved your mother , you know that , no , you . I didn t , dad , and she s right there . Tell her again . Because they have to realize , Episcopal is basically Church of England , which was 108 breaking away from the Catholic Church . </s> <s> I m the fucking Pope now ! He broke away and then people broke away from that church to a Calvinist . They found him to be too loose , and then there were the people who broke away from the Catholic , they were the Puritans , our ancestors . People so uptight , the English kicked them out . How fucking anal do you have to be for the English to go ? Get the fuck out ! No , take your kids shoes and go ! And they land here in America going , hello ! We bring you guilt , syphilis and alcohol . I hope you don t mind here , Chief Try this and watch me from good . Just keep moving till your feathers float . There you go ! And then you go , oh , but we have a gift for you . First , it s a sacred herb , but for you , it ll be an addictive costume , and I hope you enjoy it . tobacco is a lot of fun , and a good cash crop in here . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Welcome to Custer s , a casino that cares . This is my wife , sits with a full house . It is now time for the white man to get drunk , and we will get back to land here , took from us . Thank you ! And here s the thing , all those people of the Puritans , they stayed here and then they ve groups broke away from them , and then they get the people that really become severe , and the people knock on your door . At 6 . 30 in the morning on Sunday , they go and head to you , fam , geez ! And you just want to come to the door and you can go , no , help me look for him , come on ! Yeah ! You get people like cat Robertson and Jerry Foule , so this was proud upon us by our sinful ways , and we ll put him on a plane . Take him over to the idol of the world wide fundamentalist wrestling ! One time only , a life after this match for all of our souls ! Let s get ready to humble ! Because here s the drill . Fundamentalists take it to be the word , not translatable , not metaphorical , the word . In the beginning , Genesis let there be light . Could there be a metaphor for the big bang ? No , God just winked . So you re staying where all descended from Adam and Eve , then we re all cousins . That s right . Lendon , dendon , dendon . Here s the thing , there are miracles , all those miracles in the Bible , like when Moses , and I m not talking guns and Moses , no , I m not talking . Not Charlton Heston going , let the Jews go , the Pharaoh gets two in the head , no ! </s> <s> Charlton Heston , a man who said guns don t kill people , apes with guns kill people . Oh , Chuckie , no ! Second amendment , it s start off as a Mosul loaders , people going like this and this still continues . That s okay . But I m talking about the time Moses said to Pharaoh , let my people go and Pharaoh went in your dreams . And Moses called the God going , God , I need some help and frogs fell from the sky . Maybe they fell from the sky or maybe they were Jews with cannibal scoy . Now ! And thank God it was Egyptians and not the French because the French would go , lunch , okay ? Why should we let you go ? You re great , Peteros . I can t let you go to your place if you want to laugh . But frogs fell from the sky at that point , I m going , get your shit out ! Frogs , I said , wait a minute , that s what we should do , that s what we should drop on Afghanistan . Come on , bombs , not fluid . Fucking frogs . Frogs , let s do it . Dempster s trouble , shit they haven t seen . And if you want to get people out of caved , or shit loader , New York rats . Oh baby , you know , New York rats will be going , hey , come on , it s three . I eat pussy literally , bring it on ! But that s what they drop in , and even then Pharaoh is not blessed . He s so pleased , David Cup of field know . And then boils , and then firstborn dies . That s it ! Hebrews get out ! And everybody banish , hot and oil everybody ! Hello , let s not wait for the bread to rise , let s take the crackers and the skin off your penis . We re leaving ! Skippy , why the skin of our penis ? We re traveling people , you don t want sand in there , let s go ! And this is self passory , the dick you ve been forgetting , let s move ! We re going to the desert , and then they get to ten commandments , would be adjusted by certain presidents , that happens later . And they get to the rickshaw there to see the sea , and they go , what now , Mr . Magic , what do we do now ? What are you gonna walk in the frags , what the frog bucks ? Frogs , backs . Thank you for watching me this far . Obviously , I didn t hail . So , what do we do now , Mr . Beanchut ? And he calls to guard again , and the sea pots , and even the most outing Jew is going , you re good . </s> <s> Let s go everybody , come on everybody , let s move ! Don t eat the shellfish , I ll tell you why later , let s go ! Where are we going ? To Jerusalem , to Stardews , to Stardews , and later to Miami to fuck up an election , let s go ! Out of our cement ! And then the Pharaoh comes with the sea closes , and he calls to his cat like goblin , his cat like gum can t do shit , because it s afraid of water ! And then there s another miracle , the night the Mary said to Joe , Joe , I m pregnant . And Joe went holy mother of God , and she went , you re right ! Oh Jesus Christ , what a great name Joe ! That is so much better than Shoe , way to go ! I love you Joe , wait hold on a minute Mary , hold on a minute , so I m the stepfather of God s kid . Yeah , so I can t discipline him , I can t go , you done wrong , because the kid will look at me and say you re not my real dad . What are you doing Mary ? How did it happen ? Or to Mackilet Joe ? Or it better be Mary ? It better be a Mackilet ! I m sorry I m transforming Joe into Ralph Cramlin . But it seemed to be kind of appropriate , because up to that point all the names in the Bible of Egeo , she had Noah , Moses , Zebra , and then you get Mary and Joe . We are just a hyphen of the way from Mary Jean and Joe Bob . We could have had Jim Bob to son of God . Praise to him Jim Bob . He who finds a stuff and gets me a job , Jim Bob . And here s the other drill . Jesus was an only child because thank God who would want to be Jerry the brother of Christ . That s a tough gig . Come on Jerry , we re going to the beach . Oh great , Mom . Jesus is going to walk on the water , feed everybody , heal them , and get a whole bunch of disciples . I ll sit there with a ration sand in my ass . Great day for me . James I m going to barrage of 30 going , yeah I m Jerry Christ . What did he do ? Yeah , I ve got a high chance somebody in his spot , come out boy , heal . Yeah , look at that . Yeah , my brother , yeah Jesus , he s a carpenter , I m a plumber , you do the math . And people say to me they say Jesus wasn t Jewish , yes of course he was Jewish . 30 years old single living in home with his parents , come on . Picking him as far as this business is from the thought of his God s gift , he s Jewish , give it up . It s an old tradition . And if he was Jewish and many of his disciples were Jewish for the last supper , would they have not gone out for Chinese ? One moment no service , no sender , okay you come in now . </s> <s> Hold on , you are 12 . Oh my God , there s two tables of six right now , they re not together . Wait a minute , hold on . I got one big table by the window but you all have to face this way . Alright , hold on , you are blowing , I guess we won t need the lamp , that s very nice . And you just turn a such one chicken into a life chicken , you re back , God . And it said that night that Jesus turned to his disciples and said to one of you , shall betray me . Peter said , isn t me Jesus and Jesus said no it is not your Peter . And Simon said , is it me Jesus and Jesus turned a Simon , it s not your Simon . And Judas said , is it me Jesus and Jesus turned a woman , he need you . Thus you see two traditions beginning to your sarcasm and Gentile humor together , born . At that main moment and the next day the miracle occurred , crucifixion , resurrection and you rose against him at that and if he sees his shadow another 2000 years of guilt . Yes , and here s for me the one big question , how do you get crucifixion , resurrection and then chocolate buddies , color dags . How do you do that one ? Even kids are going , rabbits don t lay eggs , what is this ? And you don t want a kid biting the head off a chocolate Jesus , that s not good . How do you want a little creamfield cross going , no you don t want that . And you don t want to be putting raspberry jam in the grass , go ahead , we re looking for Jesus , kids come on . Because what are we trying to do , you re trying to keep them involved . That s where we have the saints , all the saints that did all those amazing things to keep you open , those saints they re all there to keep you , give you action up . And then we re starting to lose them like Saint Christopher . Sorry babe , dashboard sounds are down . The medals aren t selling very well , drop the kid off your back , pick up your stuff , you re out of here baby , thank you . We re going to have Saint Proud and our lady accessories , come on . But I want to say like Mother Teresa , oh she s the one who said to the moon , do no great things , only small things with great love and Pat Robertson said , she s not a real Christian . Why , Packer , she doesn t have a tax shelter in a university , give it up baby . Mother Teresa never had a line of product , she never had her own perfume , compassion by Mother Teresa . </s> <s> I smell because I care , compassion . Gandhi never had Gandhi chains , whether you re simply not eating or telling the English to get the fuck out , Gandhi chains . They come in size one and below .

But I know , as the certificate s Gandhi was , there was somebody in a Bombay bar going , I know Gandhi , he was a prick . I saw him sucking on a poor cut dog , hitting on Mother Teresa , he kept saying , who s your type of daddy , who s your type of daddy ?

And he knew he did it over so he was baffling me , right ? He s like , I couldn t believe it . Now , see , my mama didn t know nothing about time . I see I ain t growing with it . My mama had her own thing . It was a little different , it was called knockout . My mama would knock your ass out wherever you committed your crime . You understand ? My mama didn t care where it was , who was looking , she would knock your ass out right on the spot . So she would have came in and handled that situation totally different . My mama would have walked in there , she would have like , excuse me . What s going on in here ? Excuse me ? Who s on the pool table ? My son was on the pool table . Okay , hold on a second . He ll be out 20 minutes . I wish you wouldn t wake up early . Crazy and damn jumping on people poop tables . Have you lost your fucking mind ? You all enjoy your hamburgers , everything is fine . Everybody go back outside , don t come in here , this is covered . You understand ? He is not dead , I do this all the time . I do this all the time , he just knocked out for a minute . Don t nobody come out , you hear me , don t come in here . Everything is fine . Excuse me , can you come in for a second ? How long was my son on that pool table ? He s going to be out 20 minutes . How did I look ? Like I got pool table money . Like I got pool table money . He won t even know how to play with me . He was wrong with you . Why are you crying , girl ? Ain t nobody hit you . What is the problem ? Are you upset with me because I discipline my son ? Well , first of all , my son was on these people pool table . He had no business being up there . That s why he knocked the fuck out . And if you pay attention , you notice I left my son by this pool table . </s> <s> So when he wake up , he know why he got knocked the fuck out . Who you calling , girl ? Excuse me ? Child services . Okay , cool . Would you be a favor sweetheart ? Put that on speakerphone . Let him hear that shit . I m going to be an hour fuck with me . See , I grew up a little different . That would never happen . That would be embarrassing to my mother for us to go to somebody house and do some shit like that . You know , that s how I grew up . My mama would prevent all of that . My mama would prevent this . I would play to your how my mama would prevent that situation from happening . First of all , my mama had what we call mama talk . Now , before we go to visit somebody , before we go to the mom , or anywhere with my mama , meeting my sister , soon as we get out of the car , my mama would have a little meat with us . You couldn t get around that meat because soon she closed the door . She would just right on us , right ? She d pull up , close the door . Come here . You and your sister get over here right now . Okay . Now we go inside to visit these people . Okay . Now I promise this lady I was going to bring you and your sister over here . You understand ? So I m going to keep my word , but we re not going to be here that long because mama don t like these people . Now when we get inside , we go out like we got some sets . You understand ? You and your sister , not going to run around , not going to shit down , breaking shit because you re out on work and you can t pay for shit . So they don t break shit . Now if I look over , and I see you and your sister doing some shit , you know you ain t supposed to do . What s going to happen , kids ? Everything ? You did right . Everything is going to happen . Now I want you all to listen to me because I m only going to say this one time . Ain t nobody hungry . You heard what I said . Ain t nobody hungry . You re ain t last week . And me and my sister be like . And the funny shit about my mama right before she would bring the doorbell is funny . And she always looked back at me and my sister just to make sure we understood . Like one more time she d ready to bring the doorbell , she d be like . We be like . Now everybody thought me and my sister was good kids . No , we was just fucking scared . Now the crazy thing is this lady , she didn t know what my mama said to us right . And the funny thing is so she come to the door , she all happy to see me and my sister right . </s> <s> So when she comes to the door . What s going on with the girl , how you doing ?

We trying to find some way to sit there . And we ain t my sister , we holding hands , dear Jesus , you lovers don t let us get killed . We don t want no trouble , Jesus , help us lower . We just go stay here in this living room , we don t want to die . And the cool shit about my mama , my mama was a real smooth , you know what I m saying ? Say if my mom was in the kitchen , we sitting in the living room , my mama would always angle her chair so she could keep her hour notes right . And she would never break her conversation but still keep her hour notes right . She d be talking to her girlfriend . So me and my sister , every time she would look at us , we would be like , oh ! So this last time , this is true story , right ? So we about to leave . So when we all happen , we re like , oh , we re gonna get out of here , we ain t doing nothing . We re not gonna get in trouble . And my sister , I could tell she s getting weak because she real hungry . She s like , Billy , I m so dizzy . I can t hang it . I m so hungry . Please , why can t we eat something ? I m like , hold on , we gonna get out of here . Soon as my mama comes , we get up , we act the door , we got , we got our foot at the door , right ? So the lady is like , girl , thank you for coming by . These kids are so good . Oh my God , how did you have these kids ? Amazing . My sister like , I m trying to hold her hand , bear with me , bear with me . So just as we get ready to go out to do the lady gonna say some crazy , she s like , girl , you know what ? I am so , I must apologize to you and your kids . I didn t ask you out to try one something to eat . Do you want something to eat ? My mama s a girl , no , I m fine , but you know , ask my kids to eat one something to eat . And the lady going , you want something to eat ? Like she s trying to set us up . So I said , first , I said , no , Miss Lady , we don t want nothing . We re not hungry at all . We never eat anywhere . If you want to help us , please call 911 . If my sister , I m looking at my sister , my sister . And you know how , back in the day , old school people , you tell them you don t want to eat day food . </s> <s> They get offended , don t they ? They be like , what you , you sure you don t want nothing ? Are you sure ? We say , you know , we say , we sure we don t want to die . We don t want nothing . So the lady , this is the old school people do that , describe their food to you . She said , okay , that s cool . You don t have to eat , that s fine . If you don t want to eat , but let me just tell you some of the things I have . Maybe the change in my mind . We have some fried chicken . Yeah , we have some smothers , smothers , pork chops , and they re so good . We have mashed potatoes , but some crazy ones . We got some corn on the cob , you and your sister like corn on the cob ? Some butt on it . Taste so good . We got some field peas , we got some green beans in there , we got some fresh cornbread . Is it still warm ? And my sister s like , she could taste it , she said , yeah , yeah . Oh , we got taste good . And we gonna get butt , that s what I m like , care , I m trying to stop chill out . So the lady goes , she get to this , she gonna hit you with the dessert , that s the one that kill you . She s like , okay , well you know what , all right , maybe y all just want some dessert then . We got some sweet potato pie . Y all can t eat sweet potato pie . The crust is so buttery , it s fluffy . If y all been good in school , you know what I got for y all , cause y all some good kids . I got some peach cobblo . You could put some ice cream on it . And my sister s like , fuck it , yeah , we won t come in . We want to eat , we ve been waiting for years . We sickin this shit . Needs sleep . She got knocked out . Oh my god , I love my sister . But that s how I grew up , y all , that s how I was doin it . You know my mom was straight , you know what I m sayin ? And I got a lot of black friends that don t beat their kids . You know , it s just like that some people just don t do it , my God son is cute , he s kid in the world . If you saw him y all would go crazy . Little brandy for six years now . Handsome , got all the toys . He s a good looking kid . He bad to the mother . And his daddy won t beat him , you know . Every time I go with his house , you know , his father sittin in his funny to see a 30 year old man get turned out by a six year old . </s> <s> His son run the crib . Every time I go over there , he s sittin on the couch trying to talk to his son . Yeah . Hey , brin , that man look , though . Hey . You killin daddy , man . You know , you gotta ease up , man . Don t come in this room , no more man . You broke daddy , 12 feet and everything , you know what I m sayin ? Knockin everything down , you know what I m talkin about ? We got a little play room for you , alright ? So don t come in here . You know how kids know they did some wrong , but they still had that little goofy ass face ? And I m like , yo , man , fuck him up . Yo , he could take it . He s sick , he could take it . He fuck his ass up , though . And he like , yo , be out , I m good , I ain t y all , man . That s my son , man . I ain t doing that . I m like , oh shit . 20 minutes later , some shit is broke . Shit . I told you to fuck him up . Now I have a simple , simple theory , see if you re agree with me . My theory is leather and memory go together . It s a simple theory . Seriously , it s a simple theory . Now , I ll use this example . You hit your kid with a pound , point to the object , do not touch that . He looks at the object , he goes , that s too much drama . I don t need that . He gets it real quick , it s easy , man . You know , you re doing all this talking and shit . And then you , it locks in his mind . He ll never forget that . That thing caused him a lot of pain and suffering . So you can let it sometimes slide by , see if he remembers . Let him get close to the thing you told him not to touch . He d be walking , but when I tell you about that lamb boy , whoo ! Oh , isn t it cool to touch it ? Just checking that , you don t want to get your heart attack , come on . See , I came from a different area . You know what , man , I m proud of where I grew up . You know what I m saying ? When we came up hard and we made it happen , you know , my parents , you know , we got bees , you know . When you was wrong , you got bees . And I don t have no problem with that , because there was some good shit in bees . I remember the everything . Think about this , when you got your worst being . Remember , you had a cold , when you finished that weapon , it was gone . Your nose was cleared up . There s a lot of other benefits of a good being . You know , you never , everybody needs this beautiful , beautiful theater . Remember your worst being . You ll never forget it . You know what you had on . Who told on you ? </s> <s> And if we think about it hard enough , we all start crying . We ain t over that motherfucker . But I m gonna tell you the best thing about a being that I d love to talk about , because it s incredible . Do you remember your worst being ? Do you remember the night after that being ? You will never sleep like that again . That is the best risk you ever had . You was fucking tired . Do you know what you went through ? Running from your mama , looking at your brother since the half me law , they turned it back . We have shit to do with it . I was like three hours in top of all . But I ll tell you what was the best thing , boy . Getting up that next morning after you got your ass whoop . You was humble . You came in the kitchen , all your brothers and sisters were waiting on you , because they saw you get fucked up . And everybody cried , because they waited for you to get up . Because you passed out on the sofa . They knew you was fucked up . Everybody just walked by you like you are autopsy . Damn . He dead . He reached out mommy took that on right man . We ll see him in the lava though . Good luck . I remember when I came in the kitchen that morning I was so humble . You know , looking at my brothers and sisters and shit , everybody waiting on you coming there . You speak to everybody . Good morning . How s everybody doing ? I m happy to be alive today .

I m not giving you a divorce . You laid on the floor , who are you ? Who the hell他們 keep scary onthat baby ? A lot of people hear , They ain t use the same try to find the perfect person they like is real hard to find that person , You know what that is because everybody wants that perfect person . Now , nobody s willing to work with nobody no more . Back in the day , we used to work with each other . Remember the 80s , early 90s , you ain t got to have money . You ain t got to have a car and all that shit . Or you had to have was a dream . You could pull a hottest chick in Dallas . Remember that shit when girls want to know what you want to be ? Be like , what you want to do ? You be like , oh no . You know what I m saying ? I m like , go to school and watch , you know what I mean ? You don t get my education . You know what I m saying ?

Women want to see your dream . Let s go outside and see that motherfucker . I m not waiting . Mm hmm . You can t pull a woman no more of what you bout to do . It just don t work . Because women ask you right up front . They be like , you need a chicken to clump somewhere . You know , you re like , hey baby , how you doing ? First of all , how are you doing ? Well , you know , I m about to give my look . </s> <s> Well , I m about to leave when you get your shit , holler . You re true . That s how I do it . It s when we want the perfect man . If I did a survey of all the women in this room , I said , what is your ideal man ? I think most women would say the same thing . You know , be like , I want a man who s honest , a man who s spiritual , who s handsome , financially secure , somebody who helped me with these kids . At least one apple . A man who loves me unconditionally , oh my god . And if he has a big dick , oh god . I m gonna marry him tonight . Now you know this , all the women laugh when I say big dick . That s fucked up . Because we can t fix the dick . We can work on fellas know how we go . We can work on our finances . We can work on being an understanding romantic . We can t fix our dick . We get the dick we get . Women act like we pick our dick out . And they act like we go to pick a dick . Airman in this room think his dick is big . That s how I eat a roll . You know , we be like , you know , Joe , don t you dig me ? Come on , homie . Don t glue it all . But we don t really know . Come on . It s not like after this show , we all walk outside . And every man pull his dick out like , okay , let s see . Oh no , I m in the wrong line , dog . Some big little fuckers over the head and up . But if you really want to know , if your dick is big , that s the way you can find out fellas don t be real with you . You can find out tonight . All you got to do is ask your girl . Because a woman can tell you if your dick is big . I mean , come on . Let s keep it real . Now don t let me fuck up your relationship . Don t let me do that shit to you . Because I know you know what ? When your leader showed a night , everybody do this . You do the recap in the car . Everybody do that . You talk about the shit that you heard or stayed that you like . Right ? Now , one of y all stupid motherfuckers going to be in the car . And this shit going fuck with you a little bit . You gonna be driving home ? Shit . Hey , baby . That was a good show , huh ?

You re a chart . You re a chart . Charts were apparently protesting last week , no ? I was really , I was really wondering how did they know they have protesting ? They may have been talking peacefully in each other . Wow . Jumma , do you know what it is ? That s a very normal talk . They don t speak Hindi charts . They re all Hindi at you like a weapon of mass destruction . I m from Chennai . I would like to first thank the Bangalore people for the extremely magnificent help extended by you and all your fellow citizens to the Chennai floods of Manthanhav . Thank you so much . One of the few months where the Chennai people will not come to you and say give us the Kaveri water week . </s> <s> Don t own water . Enough water we have . Too much water we have . You keep the water place . You have better use of the water . You make beer out of it . We come all the way to Bangalore and drink tea . Don t lie , you all put it in the wax like that micro brouhri and you make it into beer . Vartur lake is forming it seems . Managati beer . That is Bikali beer . Vartur lake is formed , right ? Take the head of entry , you bhakar . But of course the first two days are so tough . We were not helping ourselves because we were waiting for our Chennai super queen to come and save us . Macha , amma , hang on . Amma , amma . Amma , we re awake . We re awake . I think she can . She only said photo . What will we do ? At least if she shent some way . I can t see if the camera is photo from higher to lower one . I ve ended and I ve done something . These boys would have done something . Right ? That photo won t be you doing . No , we won t . I got another ground . Fucking shent . Take photo . But we are very sentiment here . What do we do ? We are a sentiment state . Last year , you know , in the sheet , they put a view . Bangalore people put a beard bars , not saying the disproportionate assets . Yes . We Tamil Nadu people got a culinary point of time . They can strain to Bangalore high court and say , no , disproportionate to one . I think I m only following you . I m not going to proportionate to that . I look like a proportionate . I m just going to be nonsense . I m basically gay . So therefore , because of that , the day after Mother s Day , they sent us back to Jentabat . And that was also so sentimentally . It was like a scene in the wall , you know . When Amitabha chants , I have Bangalore . Goddy , Bangalore . What s with you ? I m Sashi Kapoor , says , My boss ma am . If Rajnikan , that bin there , he would have spoken and peered off of all the Tamil Nadu people much , ah , he would have said , my boss not only ma am , my boss not only ma am , but my boss , Bangalore . Goddy , he has a violent sense . Modi . Modi . Modi . Modi . Modi . Modi is great man . Modi is wonderful . He s great . The record in the show today . Hey , Modi . Hey . Modi , yeah , I know . I know . I know . Beware of the bugs , sir . They re all around . </s> <s> Beware of the bugs . Yeah , yeah . Modi . Great , great . I mean , great . Yeah , I mean , Modi is completed about two years . BJP made a comeback . And Modi s taken it little . You know , that s all he s been doing all year , mucha comeback from China , comeback from Italy , comeback from France . Come back from USA . Typical kucho , mucha . Once he got into the league , he international visa . Everywhere is my free free free free . Typical , but I don t know . been there . I know the theory . I know what he wanted to do . He was soon as he came into power . The Maggie got removed from our lives mucha . Oh , India , no . No . Six months , Maggie brought it back . Hey , Chennai . Chennai . Modi brought Maggie back . Manan , I get you . Nothing , bro . He brought only Obama back . When he went to the US , he s so excited . No , when to USA and bread for bread . And friend of our AEOC , friend of USA , friend of USA . He said he s a white man . Only with a tan darker . A white man . Obama . And together , they became Mobama , Modi plus Mobama . What a strange , only name . No , Mobama . Nallavale then into the other combination . Barak plus Modi would have been Kaboody . You re giving it all to me . Anyway , Modi is trying very hard . No , very hard to be there . With the most popular USA return in this country mucha . How much of an Etreys you ll only be in the second most popular USA return in this country ? First is right here . Oh , Pah . Internally , returning for USA . All of you always returning only . Why are you going there ? Returning , returning , returning . Fucking , every movie I ve been returning from USA mucha . First time I went to USA only 16 months back mucha . We went on a USA tour . Until the last minute they didn t give me USA visa mucha . Why ? Because the US country is saying , you re only America , more return , more plight . Every movie , two to two weeks you ve done only that . How can you not know about USA ? I was like , sister , not even one movie was shot there , sister . All small budget movie . Beginning of the movie , return from America . Anna International Airport . End of the movie , return to America . Anna International Airport . For this , I ve only got Anna International . End ticket so far , sister . And sympathy caught up they gave me US visa . I went there wonderful tours . But how many of you went to America ? I was like , I m a big enough applause , being a USA . I m a cheap and audience athlete . Why do you go mangallore , my suit , what is this ? How long have you wanted to go to USA to be a big enough applause ? </s> <s> Good , that s most of us . Yes , wonderful . You also , come on . Software engineers , come on . No , no , not really . But everybody should go to USA mucha . Every Indian should go to USA because even if you go over seven days you ll come back with a foreign accent . And you ll come out with extra patriotism . You ll come back with a much extra patriotism . Seven days we went , we came out feeling so patriotic . I had goosebumps on my flight as landing matcha . Not because I ve seen my mother land or my mother flag or my mummy or my doggy and all . I ve got so much goosebumps after seeing realising that the shower faucet is coming back into my concourse . Ah ! Upper ! Wow ! Pair to Anna International Airport . Cross the crew by sorry , H . A . H . we have to teach you fat for how much we had at those times . They were almost idle and I thought . . . Our duty was to have kids . Now I m sure I am . Bye bye . Cross the crew by sorry , H . A . H . H . A . K . O . How is my paper paper ? paper paper paper . If you have a client s base overseas , the American clients give me a brown nose or a blouse . To release these American people , your bosses , your clients and all that will never say , go fuck yourself to your face much . They ll never say , go fuck yourself to your face because that s so polite , unimpolite and un Christian . You know what American people will say instead of go fuck yourself , they ll say , good for you . GFY , GFY , same meaning only , my job , good for you , that don t go fuck yourself only . Another thing American people will never say , oh , they ll never say , I mean they ll never say something , fucking boring , like they ll find something bloody boring , they ll never say , you know what they ll say instead of that , they ll say , oh that s interesting . After my first peak in the USA , I thought of so interesting because every American person will say , no I know better matcha , somebody doesn t like my show and this auditorium now , good for you . Now , little I ll beat you by good for you , Pani Ganga . But one thing American people have realized they should never tell Indian people is , what s up , how s it going ? Because we want just not back matcha , we will sit you down and explain to you fully , we will tell you what is up , how we can t get it up , how we need to go via Agaradu get it up , how is it going , how many times is it going , is it going solid , everything will tell you . </s> <s> After 5 minutes you ll be wondering , what did I ask him , he s been answering you for the last 35 minutes right now . Let s not have somebody to pay the weigh ins and what s up , what s up , what s up , what s up , what s up , what s up , what s up , what s up , what s up , what s up , this is not at us . And we will head back at them . The Indian head bob itself is so mind fuckingly complex , no American person understands what it means by time . What is he saying , is he saying yes , no , maybe what is he saying ? I ll tell you the meaning of the Indian head bob , it basically means good for you . You do whatever you want , I m going to do whatever I was going to do , Indian style project management . One of the most unbelievable things in the US is that every event which involved Indian people will never start on time much on . There s always this is on , everything in America and I tell them what s up problem , they say Indian standard time , Indian standard time , what is Indian standard , I ll explain to you . Basically it means that Indians will turn up late for every single event much on . If an Indian asks , what is the time of the event , it s so that he can come sufficiently late and not accidentally on time . In America has four times zones , as unfrancisco time is three hours behind New York time . In India , whole of India is three hours behind Indian standard time , which are . We are left for every single event except the one event where timing really matters , no , Indian men will come early . Indian women won t come only once . What if I open Indian power ? Don t say what you do , you don t know if you knew you will do it better what you do . But I want to explain the Indian concept of time as well , and Indian says , I ll be back in five minutes , so I won t be back in five minutes . It means for five minutes , stop wondering where I am , okay . For five minutes , he ll start wondering . When Indian says , I ll just be back , he won t . It means you have to gauge how long he ll take by his emphasis on the word just it . I ll just be back , I ll just be back , just be back . Whatever happens , he will be late , you have to adjust it . But the best is what Bangalore people say , this is a quantum of time . Please give me a positive , I ll say this as a quantum of time saying , how long will you take , my child ? I am on the way . Bangalore person says he s on the way , not he is on the way , but that follows not on the way to the journey of the destination , that follows means he s on the way , the journey of life flat . Life is a journey , you re all on the way , permanently on the way . </s> <s> But the best notion of Indian time is exhibited by the software industry , because the average age of an Indian is 64 years , with average age for a outsourced software professional is 128 years . Because even though the software professional is my entire age of 64 , he has already been productively built in terms of man hours and years to the international client to the tune of 128 years . Any international client saying , how could you believe for twice a year , simply say , he s an Indian person , he was working hard , then he died . After a re boying night , we have the average age of 4 policy , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across the country , we hire people across C Big Joe , say , they hire people across the country , they hire people across the country , they hire people across the country , they hire people across the country , they hire people across the country , I think they just keep on driving and illegally migrate without realizing it . Luckily for them in the south there was the Mexico weather , there was nothing called illegal , They wake up and ask God , why Guru ? Why Guru ? Why ? Why ? Why ? But it s so ironic , Man . It s so every American person , low class , middle class , upper class , everybody has a smartphone , yeah , homeless people have smartphones . And it s so ironic seeing an American person with a smartphone because most often the phone is smarter than the American person . Very soon they should get an , they should all write a SAT exam and deput it on the marks they get , they should get a phone accordingly . With the marks they get , they re only getting a Vagu Daki . The only people who deserve the great phones , like iPhone success and the Google Nexus phone and the OnePlus one phone and all that is our South Indian people much . Our son , last one link . Because what marks the SAT exam ? They re not going to get a Pichita , they re going to get a Pichita , they re going to get a mark . But the irony is , we South Indian people can t afford iPhone 6 much . No , no , we can t afford it . But we want it afford it . That s why you dicho went to the Thunder South for the day , that anyway we wanted to get an Apple app . </s> <s> I don t want it . I don t want it . diagnosis . The one that needs an Apple s phone . . . what Pa introducing for the holidays I have to ask them to come to me . But festivals , he said , Taita is better . Always , Taita way better . God , God , I said , Taita is better . Taita , I feel . But this is one of the most exciting things that happened to me when I went to America much . When I landed in East Coast , landed in New York , and New York has a very strict immigration policy . I mean , they just see it , they can send you back . And that fellow is looking at my visa and papers and all that , he s looking at me saying , where are you from ? I said , India , he s like , whoo , the land of the Kham Sutra , huh ? Huh ? I m like , ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Not really , ah ! I felt so guilty taking credit for the Kham Sutra as an Indian person much . I mean , I felt like Abhishek Bachchan taking credit for the box office success of Doom , you know ? I felt like Abhishek Bachchan taking credit for the cashmoney arise , baby , you know ? I m sorry . Oh ! Oh ! Tuttie people , Tuttie people , Tuttie people , Tuttie people , you all thought this , not Tuttie colours ? Man , it s like , always playing Khand Badaegar , Tiska Bati , Khand Badaegar , Tiska Bati , Khand Bati , Khand Bati . Audience fall , Hujai , audience , but Tuttie colours , Tuttie colours . I felt so guilty taking credit because I mean , I mean , he s looking at me as , I said , I m some sex god , you know ? I m like , no ! Indian man , no sex is a god , you know ? No , no , no . I mean , sex is like a religious activity in India . Meering to say it s performed in 8 to 10 times here on public holidays . And like festival , there s a lot of expectation about it , but there s a visor , then happens to two minutes , Khand Badaegar , Bapapachala . I said , I won t . And yes , it is like a , it is like religious activity because in India , it s permanently performed only in missionary position . Man on top , woman on top , I put forth on gravity , does the rest . And he s looking at me and I m like , no , I mean , when is the first time an Indian person ever gets to see the Kamashotra in the first place much ? It s in the erotic section in an international bookstore , you know ? </s> <s> Because in Indian bookstore , erotic section , there s no erotic section only . Even if there was an erotic section that probably have the Indian constitution or something there . Because that is the only book we have been fucking with for the last 65 years . Look at the last 65 years , look at the current literary output by us Indian people about sex much . It is called Indian porn . No , even however desperate you get not Indian porn , no . Indian porn , nothing happens . No , no , no , no . I don t know what happened . I don t know . Nothing there . Because this is the Arabic static . It s nothing kind of a porn or a franchise . Absolutely static , much . I mean , it is like , it s like , I mean , it is like bad wildlife photography , no ? What is happening ? Nothing is happening . You don t have the computers on pause if the video is buffering . You know , it s happening . They can t do anything about porn . I mean , I feel like asking Indian porn filmmakers , look here . Gigantic size and wrapping of cheeks is not sexy . And it will not lead to sex , it is friction . And with sufficient oxygen , it will lead to fire . Only man taught us that . I mean , think about it . You have the 1800 and 21 poses in the Kamasutra . Only 2 to 3 can be performed by any average jot male , no ? No , if the aim is for the arrow to hit the athlete , no ? Because in all those complex poses , arrow sitting , water melon , arrow sitting . Papa , yah . arrow sitting next to a little boy cycle , everything but the apple . There is actually a pose in the Kamasutra called a man on a swing . Hey , he is congresing with a woman on a swing pose . By the way , that s the word for getting fucked in the Kamasutra . It s called congress . 5 years , who pee , then they reversed it as 5 years , up with this side . Holy , we got , holy . But can you imagine yourself , just imagine , you imagine , you imagine , you imagine yourself on a swing . And trying to shoot arrow at the apple , that is also on a swing . What arrow , boy , itself won t get raised , don t you ? Yo , Papa , what do you want ? No , it s not possible , India . I don t think this Kamasutra was a sex man in the first place , Macha . It must have been that complex pose , which is yoga manuvala . I think it was a yoga manuval that got vandalized by all these penis and boob drawing text and all the better . </s> <s> You got it , library , no ? Any book you draw the little peep , a boob peep is everything that I draw . Somebody discovered and said , oh , sex manuval , no , yoga manuval . Because in India , you can t do sex and yoga at the same time . Only this one that you can do . Look at Baba Ramdev . You watch that fellow doing yoga , all feelings of sexiness will be wiped out from your human being . Who do you think , sickle handedly kill desi , Baba . com ? Those guys and Baba Ramdev only . I was introduced by some property , my name is Karthik Kumar . I spell it within 8 in the middle . Air right in the middle . As soon as I crossed the India , as now first they will steal my batua . Next , I ll tell you the name of Hul . Hul , I ll become Karthik Kumar . Manmohan Singh , S I N G , H Singh , I will cover extra S I N G . H S I N G is also singh on you , right ? You are just feeling a reservation for North Indian Singh . You singh on me . I m Karthik Kumar . Why are you not the day we will remove H from our nails , macha ? That s why we are thousands of years on call to H , macha because it s H S I H . H S I H . Because when we say H S I N , one thick bit of H S I S , it s a bit thick , right there . Then we can aim at it and the North Indians won t put H S I N and put it on batua . I m fucking . . . Now , fucking . . . Of course , we also take a new revenge on North Indian people . They call it Hindi . We call it Indi . The only words we South Indian s drawing in the Indian language is , Indi Nagi Malno . And Nagi is a her there , right ? Nagi , you can t move here . Nagi , Nagi , Nagi , Nagi , Nagi , Nagi , Nagi . Nagi . North Indian people , all these people , all these South Indians know that I m a huge film star down south , you know ? I m making fun of my bastards . Nagi and that tall they re like maybe who knows , who knows ? Maybe who knows , we don t know anything more than everyone knows , who knows ? Maybe they don t know shit about South India . Even though the Chennai floods North day one , day two , no news from the North Indian media much on that to see an IBM s Times North Chennai upbeat again . Nothing ! They re talking about some nonsense . </s> <s> Finally on day three , the Times now finally broke the news much on . Finally they broke the news . Oh my god ! Shoot a shit to see the ceiling levels ! Hard eating reality . People are getting evicted from the houses . Don t forget to watch . Big boss on color is HD . That is , fellows . North Indian people , for them all the South Indian people in India are one state much on . Capitalist Madras say , All are Madras says , They all speak Malayani . Malayani is not a language banjo . It is a person from God s own country . The Gulf . What is your name , my jar friend ? Sumit . Sumit tell me , how many South Indian states are there ? Sumit tell correctly . Come on ! You re like , why the fuck in the first two eyes ? They re asking me , Continger s answer is not only , But I m not sure . Come on ! Sumit . Seven to eight . Sumit , I m going to hit you . You re dead three brother . Dead . You re extra . Dead two . I m not dead . I ll give you extra . Come on . Keep the change . Blood is out of the Indian . Why are you saying that ? Andra got split . It got split into three agonist calculations . There is a CMandra Thalengana , San Francisco Bay area . Kerala is Kerala plus seven united Arab Emirates there . There is eight . Then there is a Pondicherry which is known as , What is it ? It s called a state of mind . All Tamil Nadu people after three dreams , They re going to the Pondicherry . Pondicherry ! Pondicherry ! There are so many states . There are so many . There are so many states . Andra s name is , Andra s name is , I love it . Why are you so excited ? Because state of God split is going to be sad , right ? You re not happy . Andra s ambulance is going to be over . Andra s visa is going to be cancelled . Andra s name is , The state of God split is going to be very happy . Because all the words ending will go to Thalengana . All the words ending will go to CMandra . So the only language that binds all the Telugu people is going to stall on it . Telugu ! It will be Java . Andra s national language is , Java ! They re all disputing . Till now they re disputing . Andra s Coping Persist must do something and take it out . We don t know anything . The banks don t talk in any state .

What did you do ? What did you buy for a half on that time stay ? Dinner ? So what are you , zomata . com ? Chip it out Favorite gift is ever given you First you have to say it First you have to say it You have to say it out and say it out And you have to say it out And this was also the wedding season right now And we Indians have to buy gifts Such a tense period for Indian people much Because we Indians hate giving gifts much We hate giving gifts , we love getting gifts Love but when we go for wedding , why should they buy gift ? My present itself is gift only now That s why this moment is called the present This kunti is kunti snog and gul Indians only invented Because I ll tell you basically there are two kinds of gifts that we Indian people give much One is known as the awesome gift Awesome gift is when you look people into the heart and soul of the person Who is about to receive the gift Find out exactly what s missing in their life that fits into your budget And then you buy it for them This is an awesome gift As I said heart and soul itself this man is like no , I want to give you a gift Which is heart one soul Which one is the heart which is soul Indian men are incapable of giving awesome gifts Basically awesome gifts are given by Indian women to other women And to the undeserving Indian men That is an only gift that be Indian men gift That can be qualified as an awesome gift is the gift of the baby Even that we men are always trying not to give you women No , somehow even when a woman comes and gets a better But she is more than anybody who will say we will act happy and take credit for it No , I mean you are thinking control all that control all that project about project about About about about about restart the machine . </s> <s> What is happening here wrong game over it What a restarting here . That s what we ll think the truth is we are There is another gift which is the other kind of gift of one the awesome gift is known as the Kunti gift Don t make that face really Couldn t any gift that we gave that we felt guilty giving the face placing Why are we giving this gift for giving this gift we might as well not give a gift that way we will have more respect And not giving this that is called a Kunti gift much There are three kinds of Kunti gift based on the pricing of this Kunti gift First is that cheap and Kunti gift It is not only Kunti it is cheap It is not only cheap is Kunti So what it desperately lacks in price know we ll try and make up for in size Pence time will buy a Kunti gift so that appears in the photo when we take it later and tag us At the same time you can t buy an oddly shaped one because oddly shape means will be remembered and people will not this fall off Kunti was given by that Kunti only So they look exactly which Kunti to tag So no just one big generate big one Second is the medium budget Kunti gift Which is a safe gift no one can fault you for buying a bouquet of flowers , no Like you know you got a five star hotel pick up a florist and buy the stocks and shoots arranged beautifully and The bouquet like French bouquet . This should not be confused with the Indian bouquet bouquet bouquet bouquet is a cheap and Kunti gift bouquet is basically flowers in a coma That have been embalmed and mummified in a plastic cover Help to gather in their grave by stapler pins If you try and get to the flowers the stapler pins will appear to your skin and start purting of the blood So like zombies lying in their grave you ll have to just watch them saying abyocha to the painter K There s only bouquet third is the expensive Kunti gift What do you think ? You re pretty expensive and Kunti at the same time Everybody know I know lot number of cheat people putting small amounts of money And buy one expensive Kunti gift This is what is known as the Gumballora going that gifted You know who s shouting go in that loudest But the real Gumballora is the one who gives the gift 25 people can t give no one follows the Gumballora is the Gumballora is the winner Gumballora will be forgotten by the end . Only Gumballora will take all the credit and go away But there s one more gift that we Indian people give please give me a round of applause if you ever given this it s the Kunti of the Kuntis It is known as the re gift Kuntis Confess , Confess , Confess , Confess , Confess , Confess , Confess Re gift oh my god is the Kunti of the Kunti gift It is that gift that you never bought it all in the first place You just spontaneously wrapped up some item and gave it away Anybody in the zoom who has cello tape and a wrapping paper at home is a culprit Why else will you have gift wrapping paper at home , but it s not as if I was a field with gifts that didn t Spontaneous wrapping all the time It is that gift that you invested nothing into it no feeling no thought no money except a thinking Which is the item I want to get rid of the forces of the pick is that looks somewhat new What is that item that is only because it s called a re gift because once it s received it will be opened re gurgitated upon And then re return to the vicious cycle economy of the re gifts out there much I truly believe I truly believe there is a finite number of laughing buddhas Sifting away car and those Billy Club Ganesh Shaws That are in permanent circulation out there We all become mediums for it much We can t do anything about it you try to remove that of circulation some party or maidens and all that I reckon put it back into circulation We can t do anything about it we have only thing we can do is Indian people please remember is whenever you give a re gift Don t give it with aham garam I reckon they don t give give it humbly with some modest with some please to be humbly because like Karumam and Karumam This is eventually going to come back to you only It s been a tiring day I ve been Traveling a lot I traveled A close to Chennai then I got down and got to Uber and came into Bangalore You call it air port or something like that just How many of you agree that air ports are becoming so safe know these days So safe no multiple sketching checking points Beeper scanner X ray machine full body grouping and massaging its security check I want men go in the coming of thing my wife doesn t know I m with them . </s> <s> I m going to go in the I m not a girl I m a wonder if I know why you re not letting it at this wonderful grouping massage and why they stop it ? Why didn t we install CD scan machine also much that way you can do full body biopsy and brain tumor detection for all the passengers Charter passengers that way at least airlines will make some money no because the biggest camera right now They re saying no no air penalty days have come down that time it will be 3000 rupees now So only 1200 rupees to come to Bangalore Mananda and the tea Those days air ports used to be within the city now they all move to halfway to the destination city Bangalore is moved to Horsesore Hyderabad is moved to Shamsadabad Coaches move to Dubai I think That the entire route by traveling a Uber and Walla in 2008 and we re going to go to the Ugar Then believe me the skin for share airlines and spice your airlines run taxi service to airport They ll make more money than running airplanes of this Next level of security have seen this javan s airport javan s very bulletproof jacket and holding AK 47 heading behind these sacks For our protection it seems After watching the money , I don t feel safe I m like why are you wearing the bulletproof jacket and why are you hiding behind sacks ? You only have the bulletproof jacket in the AK 47 Why are you hiding behind it ? We are the passengers who ve been stripped of any form of potential weaponry Paper , cutter and merskipper everything has been taken away from us By the time we enter the airplane we don t even have small scissors to cut the nose hairs for the terrorists We can t even pluck one hair Really ? Best is when they remove my shampoo bottle I ll be like That way at least I could have loved though the terrorist to death Die , terrorist die these bubbled shwyls mainly irritate your eyes and You ll have silky smooth hair and Then they ll all think you re a girl and we ll send them to Gurgaon in the rest of the village Next is that long cues that two were long security check cues much I m sure 500 meters which are pointed point is only five meters away from each other 500 feet up in the air and it s truly inspired by the Tripathi Jarragandhi system much And it s only appropriate because these days we re flying in this air asia M 37 There s a good chance you ll get to see going that person only The aircraft will have a run out of wind out Only happening there And the best level of security is once you go into the airport No , once you go into the airplane the air host is coming Which you may be willing to open the emergency door instructions Which you may be willing to open the emergency door during a I m like Okay , ma but Where will you be ma ? </s> <s> The entire airplane is only 100 feet long Why are you planning me to do something that you can walk 15 feet and do so yourself ? Confirming to me the fear that if the plane goes into emergency marchand these air hostesses are going to Auto eject and parodrop from the flight That s why their seats are on the will to facing us So that they can wave us goodbye Revenge revenge revenge for not listening to anything we said so far And only staring at the boobies and bumps We Indian men deserve it Tartif from Indian men , especially in the last 18 months of 20th of the month You became so badly , no ? But there are some concepts that we Indian men just don t get much Like last year at a mother s day , I mean sorry women s day we march eight or something I put up a tweet saying I m openly outweating I am a feminist most of the people in the Twitter community what sir you became gay sir ? You became gay sir ? No much are not gay no , you did Bangkok last year , he said , what sir , he said what ? Okay , voice is still like this , why poor ? Educated people saying , oh you being a feminist , so where are you doing the court ? JNU , JNU I am not doing anything in JNU much of fuck you I mean feminism is not a state of belonging to a state of sex much I just a state of belonging to a state of my Leave me He s so angrily staring at me right now What is he saying ? He s really empowering me My wife is really empowering me I am a very young girl I will be able to get all this from her Indian men , men What is that ? What are you only ? I am a gay and a co owner There are other concepts we men don t understand Like another concept that we men just don t understand is sexual harassment Because the word sexual is confusing the Indian man into believing that this must be something sexy Something sexy is going to happen Then something sexy happens he gets harassed This is sexual harassment He said sexy and there is no hair , he is not harassed right now Another concept that they don t understand is consent much Consent we Indian men don t understand consent Then you tell him saying , what about D . P . Couple s choice ? Mike choice and all that he will be like Hey , D . P . Couple is a buddy call , eh ? She will always be chuckling between Indian men , what to do ? What to do ? We have like that ? What to do ? But it s not off alty It s not the fault of the Indian man Indian man is a naive person Because the rest of the political world is such a bad example For that Indian man follow Macha Look at a political world out there The new PM is single He is married But he is in denial about it He show him his wife he says Gujarati Bain , Gujarati Bain Then you will be like then you are a pen Hey Hey , what is wrong with you ? </s> <s> Gujarati Bain doesn t recognize his own wife Old PM is definitely Definitely kept a safe distance from anything that altered his heart rate and any fashion Macha Including governance I am sure the only sexy event enjoyed is Overly getting abused by Sonya Ji Very hard to avoid a BDSM sex Yeah , it released as a boy you know It was called 50 Shades of UPA Raul Gandhi , poor fellow , the only guy who said I want women on top last is election I mean see , I mean last election , last election All the election is poor fellow You can t even try You can t even try to get hit , no ? If you don t pop , it s job is to keep up That s all he looks like Macha Speaking of that , Arun Kajrawal believes that he is the only one who should be getting any action Soon that s how he will be getting action also by himself only Next is the look that Superman is Sonya who definitely confused him overall for Warpal And is appropriately single all his life Butthornly , fuck , fuck , fuck this The look that , the such a shit that only is the only guy who looks like he is getting any kind of action at all That fellow , the only guy who looks like he is getting any even he The Indian people put so much Nazaar on him is wife got loopas and died in a murderous day Nobody knows what that means Macha Look at even Tamil Nadu Macha , we have mother , we have Tata Without UPA , our daddy being involved , what action can happen ? If you put mother and Tata together , you only get Hata , you only get But there is this other concept that we Indian men , we think it s a metaphysical thing It s like the black hole theory We don t understand , it s a metaphysical concept to us Indian men I will even utter the word right now people will be like Indian , what are you talking about ? It is known as the Clitoris Not seen at where is it near Agra , where is it ? It s a metaphysical thing , we have Indian men or in denial about it Macha We don t believe it exists , India may know Indian women don t have Clitoris Only foreign women have Clitoris In fact , Clitoris quit India law for the British and 1997 What do Indian women have there ? He says Sanskriti Sanskriti has to protect the country , protect the people Because this Clitoris is a very very advanced concept for us Indian men to accept Macha Because clitoris is , we have to first accept that Indian woman has a penis and it s known as a clitoris . As a satan , he s like , what ? No ! I m a jottu ! My husband is a hodikar ! Because he s thinking , oh my god , I have done that she has done that means only . The mutual activity we can be involved is playing Dundia . </s> <s> And not a kind that leads to Karbha . Because it s a very difficult concept for Indian man to understand that Bacha . Because I m sorry women , it s gonna take us one more generation respect you Bacha . But it s gonna take us two more generations to give you an orgasm . Because we Indian man are in denial about the clitoris Bacha . We are . The only way you can do is pretend as if we only discovered it . We are Columbus and this is only America . Pretend fake it fake it you fake so many things you might as well fake this so that you don t fake those other things no . Please ! Pretend we will take all the clitoris Bacha . I already discovered it ! Let us feel like that . Otherwise you ll have to become like Ramita Vachal and Janji Ramachan . No , not Parish officer . Then you become like Kiran Bedi . Imagine the entire men of Delhi rejected one woman means how will it feel ? What a horrible event ! All the men of Delhi rejected her Bacha . How much you must be feeling so horrible ? No , I m not feeling like you ll have to take the law into your own . I wonder if you ve put on weight recently in the last one year or so . Confess . About a one kage , two kage , up there giving me a big round of applause . So sweet . So sweet . Everybody s confessing yet . Or as we call you Fatis . Fatis , I have put on a little weight here . I put on a little weight in the last year and a half . I can feel it . I told them saying , I did this movie called Passing Got Two . I felt like what it must be to have two kids . I wanted to feel that . Just a method acting . Bindu Madhavi was my hero and she looks like she s my bad head kids . I looked like I had those two kids . I put on a little weight . But I think that it s a personal issue . I think that it s a personal issue . Initially at that stage where I thought that nobody will notice . Only I will notice . I ve been in that stage giving me a big round of applause . You know where you are ? Suddenly you will be constantly adjusting your clothes as if it s the fault of the fabric . You ll stop tucking in clothes and we re tucking in tummy all the time . No , you can t keep on adjusting your hair to give it more volume . So that overall some weak shape is maintained . No , that is the only way . Lots of volume will give the hair . Our normal respiration itself will be replaced by taking in shop pets of hair . So hair goes into not only our lungs and stomach but pancreas , small interests and kidney . </s> <s> Everything air should go inside there and all . And you should see our birth . Our selfie angles will move from acute to obtuse to absurd . I mean , poverty , poverty . I ve read it all looking like sharks in the photos . I thought I was at that stage then where in India , my child . It s society only notices first . Society will tell you your fat even before you begin fat only my child . In India society weight is sort of personal issue . The public equity issue . Everybody in society is a shareholder . You are the blue chip stock . Sir , you are the stocky blue chip . You see , I mean believe me , everybody will come to me and say what ? What is the hell looking so healthy ? What s the good news ? Day I m a man , Macha . I ve some foreign sarikas . I ve been telling you also wonder , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . Everybody , everybody , random aunties and weddings , waiter and a to be restaurant . Everybody will be asking me . And best of all , look at me and say what is the preparation for a role ? What role ? What role ? I m a traffic consumable employee . Top of I am saying what ? The irony is whenever we go to Indian actors play a cop and movie , we go to gym and get six packs on all the way . Why ? Where are these cops with six packs , Macha ? The only cops I ve seen are six packs . If you have six packs of beer , you will see that it s a drunk and driving . Drink it all and become a tie with the top of himself . So of course once you put on weight , you will change your diet . How many people have changed their diets in the last two years ? You re painful , Macha . First it is the avoids , the weights . Then they will say why the blacks ? I m like what is the civil rights movement ? What is happening here ? Why it s so bad ? Why not black ? Why not ? Then they will say , no they are saying gluten . Gluten is the enemy . I tell you the best of dieting , Tepe . You put on little weight you said . No , it s just avoid . What is that food ? Food . Gandhiji followed that diet . So obviously me was a player . I m an intern player . All these are GM diet , Gandhiji . Yeah , yeah , really ? That Dandibar is not . GM diet , third day salt craving bar . What is it ? You re going to salt , salt , salt . I want , you did GM diet , Macha . </s> <s> Diet , diet fucking salt craving that Dandibar . So that s all . But now they say gluten . Just avoid gluten , Karthik . Gute and everything . Avoid gluten . What is it ? Where is gluten ? Gute and everything . It s the carol of black magic . It sticks to you like glue and then never leaves you . It s gluten . So what is going to do ? Everything , gluten . Even the air , if you please contain gluten , it seems . Air is 60 nitrogen , 20 oxygen , 10 air from opening L . A . I get . . . Woo ! And 10 is gluten , it seems . Gluten is in everything . So but my dietation is like , don t worry Karthik , you can eat anything at all . You have no problem at all . You only eat chicken , very , no problem . Just avoid the chicken , chicken is gluten . You want cheese , birth , pizza . Eat , just avoid the cheese because that s gluten . And bursting is a typical gluten activity . You want to eat PCP in the batch , just avoid the PC in the bay , let s just go have a bath . Next is fitness regimes . Change , become fits . Go to the gym . Come , go to the gym , everybody . All people in my Facebook page are running marathons right now . So , how do you do that ? How do you do that ? How do you do that ? Tell me , if you have any last one year , at least five to six friends of yours have all tagged them something . I m running the marathon . Running the marathon , nobody . Yeah , call it very with these fellow fucking bastards , man . So far the only physical activity in those fuckers would have been involved in speaking on Facebook , sending me candy crutch invite . Next time somebody sent me candy crutch and I m going to invite myself over and crush you for candy . If you know what I mean . This marathon running is a scam , macha . It s basically event management company s cheap plan to conduct a gigantic event at no project , macha . Always event management companies are one and I want to connect a big event where I have to be nobody . No performance , no celebrities . I want the audience to pay and come in . I want the audience to become a performer itself . I don t want to hire any pop or go in , I want to do it . I ll do it on the road only . And if the topic principle comes to stop , I ll make them all run away . That s really marathon long . Please watch the look at it if they run . </s> <s> They ll say run for a cause . Hey , macha , if I doggies are chasing you and first of all you re running , that is running for a cause , macha . For no reason you re running 40 to go with it , they re running because you re loose . Because marathon is not an easy task , macha . Marathon itself is called a marathon because in the Greek battle of marathon , one over enthusiastic Greek guy , run 42 kilometers carrying a message and tied before even he could reach that message that clearly didn t reach any of us was , please don t run 42 kilometers . Like , over enthusiastic Greek guy , wait for the metros of the anything place . Because what do we Facebook generation people do when we can inspire to run marathon , macha ? We merely go to flip cott and bike , span textites and running shoes . And that delivery guy will be running marathon to reach it to you . You ll be sitting like an undiesinked delivery charger , people leave . And please , what ? Please , Indian people don t wear span textites , but please , no . It is not shooting of our constitution only . Indian mental is no , it s applying pressure on me . So it must be slinging in , no ? What is inside will not disappear , huh ? It is just pop out . And we all look like bandaged , bumblebees . And what is running shoes ? Any shoe you wear and run , that is running shoe only , no ? No , no , running shoes is a separate shoe which has an inherent feeling and momentum of running in it . You just have to wear an act to it , it s him . Scooony . When we are small with white canvas shoes , we did running jogging by text . How goes everything , no ? No , there is a separate jogging shoe , then there is a running shoe , there is a jogging , but not yet running shoes . Walking , but not yet jogging shoes . Standing in the same place shoes . There are even shoes that look like feet . Have you seen that ? Not this one , if you have some bony , skeleton on feet , I mean what the fuck is that ? I ve only seen ergonomic and aerodynamically designed to give the absolute comfort of walking on feet . Then walk on feet , no ? You only have a pair of sandier menna . Next to what we do , we will wear spandex ties and take selfie . Then we will remove spandex ties , amma , Adhiliyatthavadindru . My advice to all my friends is you want to burn calories , don t run marathon matcha , wear and remove spandex ties hundred times . That will burn more calories than running for it or glaminers . How is your power , what does spandex tense you ? You are a bloody punner , I am a nalar . Marathon or an abundance , yeah . Bangle of people , I love you guys , you have harassed us , chennai people for all our lives matcha . Because you guys are such a cool place and you guys are chennais of fucked up , chennais of fucked up , chennais of fucked up , chennais of fucked up . </s> <s> Yeah it s true , it s true , it s true . Chennais fucked up , Marathon . But we are fucked up and a very unique way , Marathon . Because first of all , let me tell you the world itself is fucked up . World is on a different state of all and different states of fucked . For instance , first New York is on a state of , I don t have any time to give a fuck , so just go fuck yourself . I mean good for you . San Francisco is going like , I have all the time in the world , but go fuck yourself . Enjoying . You guys like , there s nothing God fuck anymore , the queen hasn t done it in the last few days . We have abolished fuck , nothing God fuck anymore . Bangkok is like fuck is hurriedly , where are we fuck you on ? What are we fuck you on ? We are fucking everything , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come . Middle East is like , Allah told me to fuck you . Israel is like , Jesus and Judas told me to fuck you . Not Korea is like , no one told me to fuck you , but I ll fuck you anyways . Fuck you , Stan is like , no one need to tell me to fuck me , I ll fuck myself . Repeatedly , India is like , fucking is against our culture . Only in anything in this inner culture . Chennai is on a different state of fuck altogether much . Because when a Chennai says , fuck no , he just doesn t say , fuck you , he ll say , what the fuck ? What the fuck ? What the fuck ? But the North Indians and Americans don t think it s what the fuck ? No , that . No . What I mean , fuck it . Fuck you , you mean , what the fuck ? We Chennai s don t just keep all fuck about things , we give you two . If you wanna eat , it s gonna be hard , you have to eat . Take it , take it , you guys , one more , take it . Wonderful place , much of it . Because Bagelon keeps harassing and saying , you re not an international destination , no , no . And I keep telling you , what do you need to be an international destination , much of it ? Chennai has everything , what do you need ? You need something high in your city , some seer , starware , I feel tower , something like that , no ? Then you need something that goes around and around , like some Singapore , flyer , London , flyer , church , steps of stent , peat or something going around and around . Then you need some famous bridge , like Golden Gate , bridge or London , bridge or something like that . </s> <s> Then you need wonderful food experiences , Chennai has all of that , much of it . You want something high , go to LIC building . You want to go higher and go to Tasma , Gammas , Tasma , bar . You don t have to drink there , the urine smell , the entrance is so high , you want to come down out of that only . You want round and round experiences available , Chennai , not available , anybody else in the world , you don t know what the fuck it is in Chennai also , it s called , round and round . Round and what the fuck is round and round ? You may want to go left or right , you keep on going round and round and round and round and round , round and round . Next you want famous bridge , here we shot the famous movie , the classical movie called , Bridge Over River Eye , Adhyar Pricks . But you want food experiences , Chennai will give you , Italy and Sambar in any combination you want much . You want normal Italy and Sambar go to Ananda Bhavan or go to Sangitara Strat . You want lots of Italy and small amount of Sambar go to Kayenthi Bhavan , the local Telavalas . You want small amount of Indian buckets of Sambar go to Latha Kavain . You want small amount of Indian , small amount of Sambar if you want , if you want to go to Ketni , go to Vattal Saranabhavan . But we have something in Chennai that is all parallel much , I internationally , it is the common as you ll the Disneyland Park experience . At the same time the Bangkok and Amsterdam thrilling jilling experience , it s called the Share Auto Ride Experience . My God , short man , I will tell you , the Share Auto Ride Experience is basically a community experience , for the most unbelievable , unreasonable number of people are packed on a bulk cubic centimeter basis . No discrimination whatsoever , man with man , man with woman , woman with all combinations are possible . The entire auto is kept in a warm to hot temperature , caught by the rubbing together of human bodies . For your work , it is to pre fortilize and up to you be ready . Best is you don t have to do anything much , you just have to fit yourself in the gym , the jala bling , spoolings , ruffling , couplings , everything will happen to you . You will walk out with a white smile in your face , not knowing who to thank , thank you somebody , thank you . Rumble on the air in the road , I love like , what a wonderful rubbing . That s why the Share Auto Ride Experience , you ll never say a bit discrimination you re going , you ll say , it s the best direction you re going , I will get on , I will get off only after I fully got off . Like I m the show by saying my favorite experience in the USA last two hours , watching a Hollywood show in Hollywood , on an iMac screen , Hollywood premiere , we got to watch Interstellar in LA , Vacha . </s> <s> How many Interstellar fans in a house ? Awesome , how many of you really understood Interstellar ? Nothing , I understood what I was like . What s the value of every book , something , what s happening , nothing , I understood . The only thing I understood Interstellar is after 50 years , America said , after 50 years , dust will be the greatest challenge of the world . I m like , huh ? India has only conquered dust in the first place , all non linear things in India when you re not touching them . I m a staring atom , they ll be security industed . Coming back , everything will be covered by dust . Dust is the original heat , it s boson particle , you know ? He says that German sendos will invent the atom . Bos is that ? Jarrav , Bengal is sentos will invent the thin film of dust covering all the atoms . I have asked them much , whenever I cross Dubai sector , no , my asphalt disappear . I went to my doctor and said , what s the problem ? He s saying , you see , Poland content in India is very high . Poland content is imps . Apparently India , like all the human beings , also the trees are in a permanently reproductive state . Everything is in Poland all the time , I m breathing in it , and he has my thips . What a tree is emitting in Europe and , hey , America , are all white bicycles , huh ? Dust is only a bacha , dust has been there since the time of Shirdi Sai Baba on Janayar , all the time . Have you seen the pictures of them with the tail over on their head ? That is not a halo , that is dust only . India s law observes it does all the elders of the car , how the country is telling young people to become like dust only . First , first , first , learn to settle down . Hey , pop , patul , settle down , settle down , settle down , we are just talking about dust . I always settle down , my mother always tells me to settle down and I stop it . settle down , now have a child , they settle down . Have one more child , settle down . Go out to the country , settle down . Come back to India , settle down , settle down , settle down . We also did not watch one other movie that released at the same time , which is a Hobbit 3D release that time , watch out . And the all out year fans got so excited seeing their movies . How many LOTR fans in those give me a big round of applause ? This Darithiram s only . God so excited , say Hobbit 3D , Hobbit 3D , I am like , my child , this movie only released last year , the year before that also released Hobbit . The year before that also every year released Hobbit , that s not Hobbit , my child , that is headless . Hobbit is a prequel to the lot of the rings and that got divided to three parts . So a lot of the rings , one is actually Hobbit 4 . </s> <s> Or Hobbit 1 is a lot of the rings , minus 3 , I am like , what , I couldn t even put up . I mean Indian person , I don t know what it is , this prequel sequel , all that bullshit . All of it is the entire Indian population of the underings and the Christian 2 , where it is going to go ? Oh my God ! Oh my God ! Oh my God ! Oh my God ! Oh my God ! Oh my God ! We Indians don t understand prequel , we only understand hum or k , ain t gone much . Where prequel sequel , everything happens within the movie . Everybody lives happily ever after before and during the movie . And if you all gonna watch the sequel and mom , mom , mom , mom , mom , kid , we all gonna watch them up , kid , and gone . I can t , I can t , and again , and again . Who , who , who , who , who leave it ? But one thing I ve realized much other than , the interstellar movies release , that means the dark night trilogy is come to an end by Christopher Nolan . And looking for the dark man , what are the Batman versus Superman . Not gonna be made by Nolan because Nolan is close to the dark night trilogy , because the dark night trilogy , any fans in the house ? Yeah , and was okay . I was okay because I think he wasted three movies in telling the entire dark night story much more . What a waste of three movies in telling an archinary Batman story ! First a Batman , begin song , then dark night song , then dark night rises on what a waste much more . We can t wait for it to be made in Tamil much more . The darkest night is sitting right there for remake rights , our pair , kept and museum all . You use our captain Vijay Khan , the entire trilogy can be collapsed into a few scenes only , but not . Beginning of the movie , captain begins just day , becomes full tight . It becomes dark night . Namila , enter the room . Dark night rises ! Thank you very much . Thanks to Big One of the audience , ladies and gentlemen , give me a big round of applause ! So I d like to end the show with something that brings all of us together , you know . So , to other big roles , sing together . One of our favorite songs in childhood is a Beatles song by John Lennon s song called Imagine . Big One of the most popular ! Imagine there is no one to go . It is easy to strong spire . You are in my dream . Just call it , fall on the ground . Imagine all the good dreams . Try to be 65 . Imagine there is no one to go . It is a very lonely , ungrateful life . Imagine there is no one to go . Only starlet , more captain . </s> <s> But better see even your one time . Imagine all the stars . This dark portion of life . You may see it , I don t know . But I just feel it , big one . I hope someday you ll love me . I feel happy , oh my . Imagine there is no lonely , 77 of the Constitutionates . It is easy to be strong . It is a very lonely , ungrateful life . Imagine all the good dreams . Imagine all the good dreams . Three leaves , right on the ground . Imagine all the good dreams . You may see it , it is easy to be strong . Bad Augustine , in constant . I m gonna cry And I should cry , I m gonna cry Stop seriously , but she says no , she s not saying , oh do me more , do me more , do me more Like , bow , but she s chasing , fucking , tamarind , but she says no , but she says no , fucking no Oh yeah You could remember hump , kill her But I ll not be a cases rap But that s all I m doing It s been more than a while , more than a shame Rightshift R משer </s>"

All they re doing is showing you what not to do when you get rich . Seriously , because none of those people are saving their money . Half of them all they have is one hit song . So they really be buying all of that shit . Seriously , 20 room house , seven , eight cars . It s just like , dude , don t you watch behind the music ? You know what I mean ? You re gonna be smoking crack in like six weeks . Hold on to this shit . They never invest it . They never get like , you know , CDs , like obviously , I just wanted a Ferris wheel .

That s a good word . It s a top word . A fuckin midget . Yeah ! Midget . That s political correctness out of control . There was no reason to change midget . Midget was an eracial slur , right ?

You draft a redneck . Not only does that do to psycho , who actually saved your money . Those guys show up to the army and like , here s your M16 . They re like , I already got one . I got some shit in the trunk . You ain t ever seen before , buddy . I went on eBay , got me some of that surface air shit . Took it out hunting , got me a moose in a duck , at the same fucking time .

They just ought to have one car for all the crazy people . They do that when you go to jail . They put the murderers over there . If you do some dude who s , you know , did some lighter shit , you don t fucking throw everybody together . It s crazy . I was on Downtown Sixth in New York one time . It s true story . I m sitting there . I m staring at the floor , not doing the sign thing . Staring at the floor . There s like 20 other people in the middle of the train .

And it s like , oh my God , that s terrible ! There was a disturbance , she didn t try to intervene . But why didn t she just separate the parties ? That s so shit you do when you first come to the city like , oh my God , there s a problem . I think I ll help out . Stab , stab , stab . I said that shit to you guys , you did the right thing . You did the right thing . It was already a tragedy , no sense making it a massacre . Somebody had to be around to describe the assailant . It might as well have been your . . .

It was like me and three other white dudes sitting there . And he gets into it this guy , he keeps coming back to that point . Like I may wouldn t say shit to these crack ass motherfuckers over here . And after like the third or fourth crack ass motherfuckers , we kind of start like looking at each other like , dude , should we not be getting offended at this point ? This is getting ridiculous . I can literally feel the heat from his fingers , he s going , quick ass motherfuckers ! Somebody should do something ! You know what , nobody did shit ! We just sat there and took it . That s what sucks about being white in that situation . There s no unity ! There s no brothers when it comes to white people . White people , we are individuals , we are the worst ! We re just like , hey , I don t know him , fuck him . That s his problem , I do not give a shit . Long as I get where I m going , this right here isn t happening . This here is happening from here over . I m from here to here and here , here . I m in this , I m in this right here , and that s over there . This shit s unbelievable . It s a little bit of a point . There s one black guy who can walk up to four white dudes , start beating the crap out of one of them . Another three white dudes , we re not going to do shit . We ll be like , hey , my son said something . I don t want to get involved . Movie starts in five minutes , hey , whatever , fuck him . That shit doesn t work both ways .

Crack a ass , motherfucker . Fucking thing you re right , my friend . Crack a ass , motherfucker . Shit was ridiculous . I d say that s funny when someone gets ratio with you and your white . Because you re not allowed to get ratio back . It s against the rules . You can t do the shit . So it s like awkward . It s like the other dude s going , I fucking taco . You fucking white boy . You fucking jerk . No , you can t do it . Because the second you get ratio with your white , then all of a sudden they wheel out that podium . And they have the press conference . You know what I mean ? You gotta be standing on . I disgrace the company . And I d like to apologize to all the members of my family . I just like to stay for the record . There was no air conditioning on the subway . I wasn t thinking clearly . I took some cold medications . I just like to apologize . I had nothing against Mexicans . I went to Tijuana . I had a great time . Please . I need this job . Please , don t do this . You re gonna see the light , too , nothing . He fucked up . He just stopped there begging for his job . Please , go ahead and get a mortgage . That s how white dudes we get up tight sometimes . And we get nervous in those situations .

Oh , the black shirt . What the fuck did you say ? I said black shirt . I should have said African American shirt . I apologize . I met no offense to anybody . Please . Please , I m already two months behind of my rent . Please , don t do this . Please . They got me . They got me . You ever seen that ? Like , the dude s always like the white dude behind the podium . Always thinks he s gonna get his job back , too . That s what kills me . The shit is over . If you re white and the second you get behind that podium , the shit is over . What you did it or not , white people have done so much evil shit . Somebody s gotta go down . </s> <s> Once every six months , the machine gotta eat one white dude . Spend him up .

Maybe we can work it through . We can work it back through . Have you ever seen that shit , though ? Do you ever feel the tension ? When somebody white , like I tell you , what s always awkward ? Did you guys watch out Venus and Serena play each other in the US open ? A couple months back . You know what s funny about that shit ? Any time like black people do some new shit , white people always gotta talk about it . And no matter how hard they try to compliment , they always come off as fucked up . It was kinda like , I don t know about that . You know what I realized watching that shit is really difficult for somebody white to say somebody black is intelligent without it coming off . Like , well , why did he get insane on Ray ? I can see he was intelligent . Why all of a sudden he s just saying this shit ? Like I said , no , Loachan , I swear to God , Dickenberg says this shit . He s watching it . Great game . Always had to do . You shut the fuck up . Say this for . Get in . You still got your job . Everything s cool . Then all of a sudden in the middle of it , all of a sudden he just goes for no reason . He says go , yeah , Venus and Serena , they re two very bright young ladies . And you literally feel the other two white dudes in the booth just being like , all right , buddy , you re on your own . Fuckin whatever . I don t know where you re going with this shit , but I want no part of that . They re like dust and off the podium . Dickenberg s like , oh shit , somebody go to commercial . Why did I start this ? They sit in there going , y all , you could sit down with them and have a conversation about a wide variety of topics . Please , please go to commercial . I ll just wait for the guy to be like , you could be doing a crossword puzzle . And maybe Serena could help with number eight . So it s like , what are you talking about , Dick ? Just say the fucking score . I got it . You re going to believe this week . I m actually psyched to be down there . I had such a fucking stressful week . My grandmother was , what are you guys chatting about ? Oh , okay . What are you talking about ? Jesus Christ , this fucking guy . Talking about me , what are you talking about ? Oh , you saved him .

It s gonna jump up here and throw it his back and then fucking sue me . I mean , it provoked your honor . I was all , all those old tips stop , but I feel like I added a bit of my honor .

My girl , she went to college . My grandma s not even been to college . She grew up on a fucking farm . I m saying , she s looking at me . I couldn t believe it . I couldn t believe it . I couldn t believe it . Should I look at my grandmother totally different now ? She used to be this cute old lady . I can sit there making like cookies . Hey , what s the jar for ? Kip cookies ? Nah , I just don t see that . You want some oatmeal and I just see everyone on knitters ? Stay away from the Jews . She s not , she doesn t like anybody . I already knew she hates Japanese people . She can t stand them . She looks through Pearl Harbor . She doesn t trust them . She really has issues with Japanese people . Now , she was 50 years ago . She can t stand them . She s always glaring at them and shit . Oh my grandma , what s wrong ? What s wrong ? Oh , they re always taking pictures . Like , they re these bunch of spies . So , I don t know , man . That really freaked me out . I guess I don t know . I guess it s where it s going to be . Should we do it ? Okay . Well , you know what I mean ? I don t mean that like I wanted to die . I m just saying like , I ain t a changer . You re 95 , you re thinking that shit ? Of course . People , it s the late show . I m opening up to you . Okay . So , anyways , you know what I m going , what s that ? What ? Is that that dude is a driver ? I said , oh , but then she s bullshit . Like , what is bullshit ? What ? That s what those dudes doesn t understand . You re doing a character . They think that I m saying that shit . Was my grandmother saying that shit ? Is that what it says ? Is this crap ? I m going to change the subject . It s my fucking act . They ll talk about it . I want to talk about it . </s> <s> What ? Oh , my god . I got my fucking jukebox or something up here . Hey , hey , hey . That s not what I m saying . That s really irritating because I was about ready to change the subject . Now I feel like I can t . I m fucking . . . Jesus , Christ . See , it s all smelling that urine all day . But people are everywhere . His face is just so . . . Rocky wouldn t say any shit like that . Oh , my god . Time is flying right here . I want to hit , ignoring the people to the right . Just plowing a hit , getting to my own comedy zone . Blocking it out . I was watching out of the Oprah Winfrey show the other night . Is this subject okay with you ? That s fantastic . I m just going to clear every subject with you for the rest of the fucking way . This subject is okay . This one is not . . . This isn t come up here and beat the shit out of me . That s a difficult thing too when a woman comes out of you . That s a fucked up situation . When a woman comes out , fucking . . . Why ? Why isn t a fucked up ? Huh ? What ? What happened ? It was all peace and love . And harmony . Huh ? He told you to handle it . Oh , the knocker out ? Me and me and that s right . That shit never works out . It doesn t work . I m telling you , that situation , it s like fucking kryptonite . You feel it from me , Todd and Bitsley . Huh ? It s a comedy show , right ? It s a good thing it was a comedy show . The crowd is heckling itself at this point . The fucking . . . Yo , you tell Table 22 , the Table 26 shot the fuck up ! I don t know what s going on . I didn t want it to be like this . I didn t want it to be like this . I just wanted to tell some jokes , make a little money , have a good time , eat a cheese steak , a little bit like that s all I wanted . That s all I wanted . I wasn t trying to sturn it shit up . I have no problems with anybody . DJ , play We Are The World . Just get that fucking thing going on . Just some sort of . . . some shit . Break out some holy water . Something good , got almighty . It s always the late show . People get a little fucking . . . Get fucking crazy . Anywho , so I m watching the Oprah Winfrey show . I like watching that show because I like watching a guest , because your guest is idiots . </s> <s> You know what , Kills , I want that show . Every night Oprah is examining marriages and she s never been married . And no one ever brings that shit up . They just listen to her , no one ever goes , wait a second Oprah , you ve never been married . So you don t know what the fuck you re talking about . And what kills me is the guy is always wrong . Every time they examine her with it mathematically , that doesn t work out . At least once the dude has to be right . You know what I mean ? Never . The woman is always like totally innocent . I was just trying to make him some chocolate chip cookies . And he didn t think there was enough chocolate chips in the cookies . So he started beating me with the cookie pan . It was horrible . Then the guy s always the biggest moron ever . What the fuck , what the fuck , what the fuck , cookie ? You didn t talk to him . Look , I m not saying guys are jerks . I m a good example of a bit . Women can be jerks too . Like in all group of women , I always wanted them to expose with those 24 , 25 year old gorgeous women who hook up and marry like a 80 year old rich guy . Never seen that , the billionaire . Like fucking old dude walking around this young hottie . Now the girl just came out and just said , look , all right , you know what , he s fucking rich . He s gonna die whatever . And I m gonna fucking make some money . I wouldn t have a problem with that . But they always got a bullshit . He d be like , no , I love him for who he is . There s nothing to do with this 60 million . There s just something about the way he drools in his bathrobe as he pushes the checkers along . It s just , you know , it s a great feeling . It s like , lady , you re humping him for his money . See , that song you never catch a dude doing , okay ? If some 80 year old billionaire old lady came walking on the street , started hitting on me , like grabbing my ass , like , hey , there , it s sunny . Hey , you re pretty firm . Are you in the name of your something ? I m speculating . Get away from me . But you re old , you re gross . I m sure you were the shit back in the 20s when you re doing the Charleston , making beer in your bathtub . But you were at least four decades beyond fuckable . Sit down and knit something . How do you have sex with somebody 50 years older than you ? The only way you can do it , you know what you gotta do ? You gotta put the will on the headboard . So at any point , when you start losing your nerve , you can just read some of the shit you re gonna be getting like , oh my god , this is disgusting . I can t believe I m doing this . Oh , how semi ammy , okay . I can hang in there for a little bit longer . </s> <s> No , for some reason , you can t ever bring up shit that women do . Because they always branch as a woman hater . But they just go off on guys . They always have like more on guys . They don t listen , they don t fucking do this , they don t do that . You know , you can never have to show about , you know , like what about women who like kind of fake a pregnancy and then say they need 500 bucks on abortion and then you find out lady , you paid their phone bill and they re rent . Anybody done that ? Anybody find that ? Never do a show on the opposite . Her phone , mom . Women never do stuff like this . No women who would do that ? No , this like , certain shit . Like , beautiful women . I m always suspicious of them . I don t trust beautiful women . You know why ? Because I know this beautiful women are only around when you have shit . Oh ! Oh , what the fuck do you know ? You re a woman . You wouldn t know . I m a guy . I know . I m telling you . When you re fucking broke , I swear you can t find a beautiful woman . This trolls and midgets running around . Second , you get some shit going on . Women , beautiful women come on . I know her like , oh my god . You have some stuff . Can you buy me some stuff ? I ve always loved you . Then the second you go broke , oh my god , I left something over here . Next to this guy who has this stuff . Now , I m not saying all women are like that , but there s women like that . Those women , they stand at the finish line of a guy s life . They re not there in the beginning when you got the futon and you re trying to get your business going . You know what I m saying ? Because that dude could lose . He could go out of business . They don t want to lose it . They don t want to win it . So they stand . They don t give a fuck . Which winner ? They just stand at the finish line . Every dude running by , they re like , I suck it there . I suck it there . I suck it there . I suck it there . I suck it there . Now this is where guys fuck up . This we should stay with the girl who is there for the futon . Because she loves you when you re a loser . But we don t do that . We fuck up because the dick s like , hey , fuck no , this one over here . Six months later , you re doing a behind the music . Yeah , you re still on that house . </s> <s> Damn bitch , chicken probably . Bitch , chicken probably . No , you know what I m going to do ? Fuck all this comedy shit . You know what I m going to make my million ? I m going to come up with some sort of piece of shit that I can sell late at night for like 1995 . Because people will buy anything . Like those George Foreman grills . He sold a zillion of those . George Foreman is a boxer . What the fuck ? Did he know about cooking ? Nothing . He s always talking about all the grease and the saturated fat . It s like , George , you re fat . You ain t , you re not using it . You know what I mean ? If people are , no , no , it s George Foreman . He lost to my homadile . And now he s selling grills . Well , I ll take one . And that makes the law to sell . People won t buy anything . I ll tell you the best scam I ever saw in my life . Have you ever seen a woman with a dude selling the quarters ? Have you ever seen that shit ? It s dude is selling quarters . How did I fuck you selling quarts ? It s a quarter . But the dude hypes it all up . These are limited edition minted quarters . We give you a book . He can stick them in the book . And he starts like , yelling to me , and this is unbelievable . You get a book . We re going to put a quarter in . We re going to add another quarter . This is unbelievable . That s two quarters and a book . That s a 50 cent value for only 1995 . People , we only have seven left . There s got like the number in the corner that bogus number . It s just like going down just to scare all the red necks . Like , holy shit , they only got seven left . Let it get the card . I m going to dial the number . Hurry . This is what I m going to do . I m going to write a relationship book . That s what I m going to do . And this one , I m going to cater it to women because I don t think guys . Guys , don t buy relationship books . You know , if we don t give a shit , what about it ? So this is what you got . I m just going to kiss women s ass . It s going to be called women . I m absolutely right . The chapter one , women of the shit . The chapter two , guys , idiots . They just listen to women . And then just the whole 550 pages just kissing women s ass . And then the back picture . It would be like a picture of me with like sweater . Like the gayest look . So I go back up and I get a touch of that feminine side . </s> <s> And then all but , you know , enough women will buy that shit and take it home to their boyfriend . You see ? You see ? That s what I was talking about . You see ? There s a million I make from that . I m going to go out and get an island . I m going to get some hookers . I m just going to get them all tested . I m going to start fucking the hookers . Just having a great time . Get some pizzas . Then I ll take a picture myself . Humping the hookers . And that s going to be the cover of next year s book . It s going to be called , ah , you stupid bitches . And then all the guys are going to buy it . They re going to take it home to their girlfriend . You see ? You got to . You just mad . Because you got to . That s all . You know what ? That shit could actually work . You d have to . You know what ? That shit could actually work . You d have to . You could make it as obvious . But , you know , you could actually . Yeah . Hookers . Let s talk about hookers . Shall we ? It s late enough . I never understood the whole , ah , like , does like a big thing . Like , if you get a , ah , prostitute , guys always give you shit . You know ? Like , dude , you got to pay for it . Like , there s some big shame . Please , yeah , fucking pay for it . You could pay for it . It s like , dude , I paid for this shirt . I m going to get it . I m going to get it . I m going to get it . I m going to get it . I m going to get it . I m going to get it . I m going to get it . I m going to get it . You could pay for it . You could pay for it . It s like , dude , I paid for this shirt . What would you rather have ? A shirt or a blowjob ? No , because you ll regret a shirt . You will . You ll come home . You ll see you got 80 shirts in the closet . And you re like , what the fuck am I doing ? I got enough shirts . You never regret a blowjob . You re calling your friends . Dude , you re going to get it . I can send my dick . It s wet . No , the only thing that stops me at diseases . If it wasn t for diseases , I d be ordering hookers like fucking dominoes . Why not ? My girl , my girl , we had a big fight like that four months ago . She went out to a strip club , right ? Which , you know , I don t mind . You know , she s dating me . I understand you got to do what you got to do , right ? You need to close your eyes and give yourself some sort of rapid fantasy . </s> <s> I understand that shit . I know my limitations . So she came home , right ? She was a little bit drunk and she told me she told me she touched one of the strippers dicks , right ? She kind of put that in like the sandwich in the middle of some day . How was your day ? Oh , by the way , I touched dick and then some shit all the way here , right ? So I m like , whoa , wait a minute , wait a minute , whoa , back up a few sentences . What do you mean you touched a stripper s dick ? Just like , what ? How did you touch it ? Would you like , graze against it with your shoulder ? How did you poke at it ? Like , eh , eh , eh , what the fuck is that ? How did you do it ? Would you poke it ? She s like , no , I kind of went like that . I was like , what the fuck ? You didn t touch it . You stroked it . So now we ve got this huge fight about what a stroke was . She s like , no , a stroke is down and then backed up again . I m like , yeah , but that s a stripper s dick . That s twice as big as mine . So one s down is equal to down and then backed up again on me . So I had her . Once in my life , I m in an argument with the woman . I m 100 in the right and I still lost the fight . You know why ? Because she cried . I had her on the ropes all of a sudden . She started crying next to you . You know , I feel like a bully . And now next thing you know , I m apologizing because she touched the dick . Fucking genius . And the thing was , I wasn t sorry . I just wanted to stop crying because I felt like an asshole . I ll tell you what kills me too , is I ve been totally faithful with this girl . And there s a girl around the corner . I know once the hook up with me and I ve stayed away . Stayed away in the second . She said that shit . I didn t think it up here , it came up here . I should fuck that girl next door . I m like nah , nah . I can t go . Hey , hey , hey . Come on . Hey , I got to watch out for my dick . My dick is a dreamer . It s a visionary . He always believes like , yeah , yeah , you can do it . Come on . Nobody will know . Do it . I didn t . You know what , I didn t . I probably should have , but I did . What s that ? I kind of messed it up on the mic stand . Why ? Oh , is that supposed to be like some jerk off Joe ? Oh , he s just like the most concerned person ever . That guy is rubbing it . </s> <s> Excuse me . What s wrong with your hands , sir ? I hope everything is okay . If there s anything coming up , if there s anything can I get you something ? There s a pharmacy only a block away . I got a computer , man . That s like the biggest thing in my life now . I m trying to get good at that shit . I came up , we just had like typewriter shit like that . You know what I m saying ? I m like an idiot now . Eight years ago , I was a semi intelligent person . I m like a fucking moron . It s like every button I hit on my computer . My computer has to like , shut down . Restart . You ever get that shit ? Regrew somehow deal with my idiocy . Then it s always like some eight year old kid on a computer next to me . He s like breaking into the Pentagon , downloading movies . Getting a plane ticket for six bucks . I m gonna fuck you , do that . I ll tell you the only thing I like about my computers . I really enjoy spell check . You know what I like about ? You know what I like about spell check ? You know how to be close to getting the word right ? Have you ever noticed that shit ? All you got to do is just get it like somewhere like within the ballpark of the word . It s almost like your computer . I could just start guessing like , yeah , shit . I don t know . Dinosaur ? You know , when you sit in there like an idiot like , nah . I wasn t trying to spell dinosaur . So now what is your computer doing ? It starts throwing out like every day word it can possibly think of like , okay , how about dictionary ? Diary ? Any of this shit looking familiar ? Are we moving towards the goal or away from it ? You ever spell a word so bad though ? Your spell check is absolutely no clue with the fuck trying to spell it . What do you end up getting ? You end up getting like a question mark . You ve got a million dollars worth of technology just looking back at you like . It s just like , you got me , buddy . Which is pretty amazing . Because I have all the words . Yeah , and that doesn t look like any of them . I can t even make a guess that so fucked up . Would you like pass out and whack your head off the keyboard ? Please tell me you re not that stupid . I am , I m the worst . I was sick too . I was sick all through September three weeks . I was sick , man . I didn t take any medicine though , because I don t trust the shit anymore . I m paranoid , man . I ve known this over the last couple of years . Any new medicine that they advertise on TV ? The last 20 seconds of commercials and just totally psychoside effects ? </s> <s> To whatever they re trying to advertise . Do you have an orange set , shit ? They always try to slide it in real quick too . Like it s no big deal . Just like , yeah , I m curious . Yeah , everything s great . Then your ear falls off . You can t feel your eyes . Then your ear falls off . You can t feel your feet . And you won t recognize your mother . 40 of the people were bleeding from the ash . And one guy thought he was a pigeon . I m not even exaggerating that bad . I saw this shit the other night , right ? It s supposed to cure like stomachache . And then the commercial , the three side effects from migraine headaches abdominal pain and diarrhea . Who the hell would try that shit ? You basically try that shit . You go from like one problem to three . You just walk in a way like , how s your stomachache ? It s green . Never felt better . No , diarrhea is not a side effect . That is a major goddamn problem . All right , where I m from the evening is over . I m going to actually people out there like , oh , it s little diarrhea . I don t worry . It s going to kind of slam my ass , cheek shut . I ll be all right . Actually , diarrhea is the least of my problems at this point . It s helping to take my mind off the migraine headache and the knifeing abdominal pain in my stomach . You don t try anything that causes diarrhea . Diarrhea is evil . That is basically your body going , you know what ? You have something so foul within your system . We can t wait for the normal process of elimination . We have to get rid of that shit right now . Never do it . I m still in the bus . Fuck it . Now . You have some evil in your ass . And it has got to go immediately . We must override . All do not shit your pants systems . Because you , sir , have a storm brewing . All right , my name is Bill Burr . You guys are a lot of fun . Thank you very much . I ll get my shit together , man . I m fucking 36 . I m not married . You know what I mean ? You re not the age where everybody knows getting married . You know , let me just a question . What the fuck do people keep getting married ? You know what I mean ? Isn t anybody looking at the stats ? What s it like ? Half the marriages are going right down the shitter , right ? People , if you were going skydiving and they told you 50 of this parachute s weren t going to open , you d be like , yeah , fuck that . I m not going . I don t like those odds . I got a 50 chance of splinting on the ground . I m not doing it . </s> <s> But there s something about getting married . People just have to do it . They re just like , is this the line to lose half my shit ? Oh , awesome . This is going to be great . I can t wait to lose my car , my money . This is going to be a . . . Oh , the line is moving . One step closer . To lose , take everything I ve worked for . No , I just talked to married guys and they scared me . Anytime you have some married guy , what s it like being married ? They always tell you it s good , but they have a look on their face like they have like an appendicitis . So it s confusing . They re like , no , what s it like being married ? That s good . That s good . No , no , no , it s good . It s a lot of work , but that s good . When you meet that special someone , it s definitely . . . I can t fill my legs . It s incredible . You can just take your battle . Very good . It s pathetic . Married guys whisper in their own house . You ever notice that shit ? It s their own fucking house . They paid for half of it , right ? And they whisper . Talk normal until you ask them to do some fun shit . You know what I mean ? They re like , hey , how s it going ? Hey , what s up , you know what s shit ? Hey , you want to go to the next game on Tuesday ? Yeah , okay , but I just kind of ask that . Terrified . That s what all becomes . Terrified . You re terrified it gets you woman in a bad mood , because you know what s going to happen . She s going to cut off the sex . That s what they do . So you have some shit they never talk about on Oprah , right ? They always expose guys for the assholes that we are , but they never talk about that shit . That s how they run the relationship . They fucking , they ration out the pussy . You stay in a relationship long enough . Guarantee sex will become like a reward . You know what I mean ? Like it took out the trash . You make big blind . Training in like a goddamn seal . Fucking terrorists . Hold the pussy hostage . It s exactly what they re doing . But I m like this country . I do not respond to terrorist threats . I ll fucking rub one out in a minute . You take out the goddamn press . You are useless to me for the next 12 minutes . I m in the bubble , baby . No ! Because of that three minutes of material , I never get laid after my show . Right there . This exact opposite thing I m supposed to be doing up here . People close up here kissing women s asses , you know ? Like most comics get in a pig . I m going to give it up for the ladies . Don t the ladies look fine tonight . Ladies , give it up for yourselves . </s> <s> So coming out to this club looking so fine . Making this fine ass fucking club even finer . Fuck that . So anyway , I m dating this girl , right ? This girl s like really it s like women s issues . So she gets me this book I women s live , right ? Now I m reading this shit , right ? It was really interesting , man . I think women s live was a great thing . Definitely necessary . I think it was totally cool back in the 70s . You know , I got to admit , over the last couple years , I think that woman s movement is starting to morph and to kind of like that reverse kind of pimping kind of thing , you know ? So every time we see women on TV , they say all we want is to be treated exactly like guys . Which sounds cool . But if you listen to them , they don t . They only want the good shit of being a guy . You ever notice that ? That Sherry picked it . They look at a guy s life like it s like a buffet . Like you just can start picking out shit . Like same amount of an hour , we ll take some of that . Pace for the movie . Fuck that . You can keep that one . I don t like that one . I don t like that one at all . This is nice . That s yucky . That s yucky . Come on , man . You can t choose . This girl gave me shit one night . She goes , well , why does a guy make more an hour to do the exact same job ? I go , I ll tell you why . Because of the unlikely event that we re both on a Titanic and it starts to sink . For some fucked up reason , you get to leave with the kids and I have to stay . That s why I get the dollar more now . Now , if there s a house fire , it s always women and children first . I got to stand there with like the back of my shirt on fire . And let s go , people . Let s go . Let s go . So that s how I look at it . No , it s a dollar an hour search arch . That if some fucked up happens either I can t leave or I got to like get in the way of it to give you a head start , you know , like rabbit dog run honey , one Mississippi , two Mississippi . You hear a bump in the night . I got to go check it out like , yes , he does have a knife . Anytime there s a hostage situation , who didn t negotiate for first ? Well , at least let the women and children go . </s> <s> What about me ? You think I want to stay in the vault with those 20 other sweaty guys ? Training a god and I m not the hostage who gets dragged out in front of the bank by that psycho . As he starts asking the cops for a helicopter , then I know he s not going to get right . They never get the helicopter . So now I got to try to convince this guy with like a 38 to my head going , dude , that s for a rena car . I think they re going for a rena car . See what I m saying ? We re all those feminists in those situations . You can t find them . They are no feminists in a house fire . That s a fucking guarantee . You could take the most hardcore feminists , right ? So I m shaking your face . You re shouting at me , you know , a little short , little haircut . The whole line yacht , right ? Second , those slaves break out . She s going to twist those little hairs into big tails . I m just a girl . I want to go take some rope . </s>"

They ain t no telling what they ve done to get them black dudes respect . Well , then black dudes have seen them do some wild shit . I ll tell you that .

LAUGHTER Then the police seen us and pulled us over . They understand I m scared as shit . I mean , come on , the car smells like we . I m speeding this man as fucking drunk . I m scared . Chip was not scared at all . It was weird . He didn t turn his radio down . And it was weird , a little bit .

Some of them didn t have underwear on . I was fucking disgusting . But I couldn t turn away . Please put a squeamish plug . One of the girls gets into it . She s just got the cops around . She spreads her butt cheeks open . She spreads her butt cheeks open . I was discussing . I was like , oh my god . Is that her birth command ? Oh , it gets worse . I knew God almighty . Is that a baby ? I know that s gross . It was a baby . It was the same baby from the project . She s like , I snuck in a club , nigga . I got that lead if you need me . Just pat on the hand . Now come out . You guys thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you . Good night . </s>"

It s our way of saying thank you . Keep your free gift . Actually , it s our way of saying bend over just a little further , and let us stick this big dick into your ass a little bit deeper . People are fucking dumb . You can say what you want about this country , and I love this place . I love the freedoms we used to have . I love it . I love that . I love it when it didn t take a fucking catastrophe to get us to care for one another . I love the fact that we re on camera all the time from all angles , but you know what you can say what you want about America . And I say , I love this place . I wouldn t have it any other way . We wouldn t live in any other time industry and any other place . But , say what you want about America , land of the free , home of the braid . We got some dumb ass motherfuckers floating around this country . Dumb ass motherfuckers . Now , obviously that doesn t include this audience . I understand that . You seem intelligent and perceptive , but the rest of them wholly jump and fucking shit balls . Dumber than a second coat of paint . And this ain t just ranting and raven . This ain t just blowing off steam . I got a little evidence to support my claim . It just seems to me , seems to me , that only a really low IQ population could have taken this beautiful continent , this magnificent American landscape that we inherited . Well , actually we stole it from the Mexicans and Indians , but hey , it was nice when we stole it . It looked pretty good . It was pristine . Paradise . Have you seen it lately ? Have you taken a good look at it lately ? It s fucking embarrassing . Only a nation of unenlightened half wits could have taken this beautiful place and turned it into what it is today , a shopping mall . </s> <s> A big fucking shopping mall . You know that ? That s all you got . That s all you ve got here folks . Mile after mile of mall after mall . Many , many malls , major malls and many malls . They put the many malls in between the major malls . And then between the many malls they put the many malls . And then between the many malls you got the carlots , gas stations , mufflers shops , laundromats , cheap hotels , fast food joints , strip clubs , and dirty bookstores . America the beautiful . One big transcontinental commercial cesspool . And how did a people feel about all this ? How did a people feel about living in a coast to coast shopping mall ? Well they think it s just fucking dandy . They think it is cool as can be because Americans love the mall . They love the mall . That s where they get to satisfy their two most prominent addictions at the same time . Shopping and eating . Millions of semi conscious Americans day after day shuffling through the malls , shopping and eating , especially eating . Americans love to eat . They are fatally attracted to the slow death of fast food . Hot dogs , corn dogs , triple bacon , cheeseburgers , deep fried butter , dip in pork fat , and cheese whiz . Mayonnaise , soaked barbecue , mozzarella , patty melts . Americans will eat anything . Anything . Anything . If you were selling sauteed raccoons , assholes on a stick . Americans would buy them and eat them . These people . These people are efficient , professional , compulsive consumers . They think of that as their national pride . It s their civic duty . Consumption . It s the new national pastime . Fuck baseball . It s consumption . The only true lasting American value that s left . Buying things . Buying things . People spend money they don t have on things they don t need . Money they don t have on things they don t need . So they can max out their credit cards and spend the rest of their lives paying 18 interest on something to cost 12 . 50 . And they didn t like it when they got home anyway . Not too bright , folks . Not too fucking bright . Well , I think things ought to be named for what they are . I think there ought to be a little more truth in names . They ve tried to clean up advertising claims . Let them clean up some of the names like Excelo and Acme and Ace Top . Bullshit . Things to be called what they are . I d like to bring out a new card . The 1977 piece of shit . A division of United consumer fuckers . You know , whenever you re exposed to advertising in this country , you realize all over again that America s leading industry is still the manufactured distribution , packaging and marketing of Bullshit . High quality Bullshit . World class designer Bullshit to be sure . Hospital tested clinically proven Bullshit . But Bullshit nonetheless . And it always amuses me that so many people seem to think that Bullshit only comes from certain sources . You know , advertising , politicians , salesmen . Not true . Bullshit is everywhere . Bullshit is rampant . Parents of Bullshit . Teachers of Bullshit . </s> <s> Where are you men of Bullshit ? Law enforcement people of Bullshit . The entire country is completely full of shit . In fact , this country was founded by a group of slave owners who told us that all men are created equal . That is what s known as being stunningly , stunningly , Bullshit . And you know , I think . And I think people show their ignorance when they say they want politicians to be honest . What are these people talking about ? If honesty were suddenly introduced into politics , it would throw everything off . The whole system would collapse . And I think deep down the American people know that . The American people like their Bullshit out front , where they can get a good strong whiff of it . That s why they were elected Clinton . Listen . Clinton might be full of shit , but he lets you know it . Dole tried to hide it . Man , honest man . Bullshit . Bullshit . People don t believe that shit . Clinton said , hi , I m full of shit and how do you like that ? And the people said , at least he s honest . Laced he s honest about being full of shit . It s like the business world . All businessmen are completely full of shit . Just the worst kind of people you get ever want to run into . Businessmen . And the proof of it is , they don t even trust each other . They don t trust each other . When a business man is negotiating a deal , the first thing he does is to automatically assume that the other guy is a complete lying prick who s trying to fuck him on the deal . So he has to do everything he can to fuck the other guy a little bit harder and a little bit faster . And then when it comes to dealing with customers , that s when you get the big smile . That s when you get the big smile . Businessman always has that big smile on his face as he carefully positions himself directly behind the customer . And unzips his pants and services the account . You hear that ? Now you know what it means . Whoever coined the phrase , let the buyer beware , was probably bleeding from the asshole . Advertising sells you things you don t need and can t afford that are overpriced and don t work . And they do it by exploiting your fears and insecurities . And if you don t have any , they ll be glad to give you a few by showing you a nice picture of a woman with big tits . That s the essence of advertising . Big tits . Frattingly . Big tits . And speaking of big tits , what about show business ? Show business completely dishonest , corrupt and foolish yet . But in a nice way . Plenty of expensive drugs and perverted sex . You re going to be foolish yet . Might as well enjoy your work . Then you have the media . Not just the news media , let s include them all . The media are almost literally exploding with bullshit . Because they re located right at the crossroads of all the other bullshit . The media are made up of equal parts , advertising , politics , business , public relations and show business . </s> <s> These people are sitting right at bullshit junction . There s enough bullshit in the media for Texas to open a branch office . And you still have enough left over to start two law firms in a Christian bookstore . Because . Because folks , I gotta tell you . When it comes to bullshit , truly major league bullshit . You have to stand back in awe . In awe of the all time heavyweight champion of false promises and exaggerated claims religion . Organized religion . It s no contest . Religion easily , easily has the best bullshit story of all time . Think about it . Religion has convinced people that there s an invisible man living in the sky . Who watches everything you do every minute of every day . And the invisible man has a list of ten specific things he doesn t want you to do . And if you do any of these things , he will send you to a special place . A burning and fire and smoke and torture and anguish for you to live forever and suffer and burn . And scream until the end of time . But he loves you . He loves you . He loves you . And he needs money . He always needs money . He s all powerful , all present , all knowing and all wise . Just can t handle money . Religion takes in billions and billions of dollars . They pay no taxes and somehow they always need money . You talk about a good bullshit story . If I may be permitted a small pun , holy shit . Okay . It s been a little while since I ve been here and a couple things have happened in that time . I d like to talk a little bit about the war in the Persian Gulf . Big duins in the Persian Gulf . You know my favorite part of that war ? It s the first war we ever had that was on every channel plus cable . And the war got good ratings , too . Well , we like war . We like war . We re a war like people . We like war because we re good at it . You know why we re good at it ? Because we get a lot of practice . This country s only 200 years old and already we ve had 10 major wars . We average a major war every 20 years in this country . So we re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . We re good at it . </s> <s> That s our new job in the world . Bombing brown people . Iraq , Panama , Grenada , Libya . You got some brown people in your country . Tell them to watch the fuck out . Or we ll goddamn bomb them . Or when s the last white people you can remember that we bomb . Can you remember the last white people ? Can you remember any white people ? We ve ever bombed the Germans . Those are the only ones . And that s only because they were trying to cut in our action . They wanted to dominate the world . Bullshit , that s our fucking job ! That s our fucking job ! Now we only bomb brown people . Not because they re trying to cut in on our action , just because they re brown . Now you probably noticed , I don t feel about that war , the way we were told , we were supposed to feel about that war , the way we were ordered and instructed by the United States government to feel about that war . You see , I ll tell you , my mind doesn t work that way . I got this real more unthing I do , it s called thinking . And I m not a very good American because I like to form my own opinions . I don t just roll over when I m told to . Sad to say , most Americans just roll over on command , not me . I have certain rules I live by . My first rule , I don t believe anything the government tells me . Nothing . Zero . Nope . And I don t take very seriously the media or the press in this country , who in the case of the Persian Gulf War were nothing more than unpaid employees of the Department of Defense and who most of the time , most of the time , function as kind of an unofficial public relations agency for the United States government . So I don t listen to them , I don t really believe in my country . And I got to tell you folks , I don t get all choked up about yellow ribbons and American flags . I consider them to be symbols and I leave symbols to the symbol minded . I look at war a little bit differently . To me war is a lot of prick waving , okay ? Simple thing that s all it is war is a whole lot of men standing out in the field waving their pricks at one another . Men are insecure about the size of their dicks and so they have to kill one another over the idea . That s what all that asshole jock bullshit is all about . That s what all that adolescent macho male posturing and strutting in bars and locker rooms is all about it s called dick fear . Men are terrified that their pricks are inadequate and so they have to compete with one another to feel better about themselves and since war is the ultimate competition , basically men are killing each other in order to improve their self esteem . </s> <s> You don t have to be a historian or a political scientist to see the bigger dick foreign policy theory at work . It sounds like this . What ? They have bigger dicks ? Bomb them . And of course the bombs and the rockets and the bullets are all shaped like dicks . It s a subconscious need to project the penis into other people s affairs . It s called fucking with people . You know if I had to say to you what is the answer I would say massive bloodshed I really would . I don t really honestly deep down believe in political action . I think the system contracts and expands as it wants to it accommodates these changes . I think the civil rights movement was an accommodation on the part of those who own the country . I think they see where their self interest lies . They see a certain amount of freedom seems good . An illusion of liberty . Give these people a voting day every year so that they ll have the illusion of meaningless choice . Meaningless choice that we go like slaves and say , George I voted . The limits of debate in this country are established before the debate even begins and everyone else is marginalized . They re made to see me there to be communists or some sort of disloyal person a cook . There s a word and now it s conspiracy . They ve made that something that should not be even entertained for a minute . The powerful people might get together and have a plan . Doesn t happen . You re a cook . You re a conspiracy buff . The only way you cure that death bloodshed I don t advocate it but I see that it s really the only . Now to balance the scale I d like to talk about some things that bring us together . Things that point out our similarities instead of our differences because that s all you ever hear about in this country . Our differences . That s all the media and the politicians are ever talking about the things that separate us . It s different from one another . That s the way the ruling class operates in any society . They try to divide the rest of the people . They keep the lower and the middle class is fighting with each other so that they , the rich , can run off with all the fucking money . Fairly simple thing happens to work . You know anything different . That s what they re going to talk about . Race , religion , ethnic and national background . Jobs , income , education , social status , sexuality . Anything you can do , keep us fighting with each other so that they can keep going to the bank . You know how I describe the economic and social classes in this country ? The upper class keeps all of the money , pays none of the taxes . The middle class pays all of the taxes , does all of the work . The poor are there just to scare the shit out of the middle class . </s> <s> They come showing up at those jobs . Right . Boy , everyone in this country is always running around yammered about their fucking rights . I have a right . You have no right . We have a right . I hate to spoil your fun , but this knows your sting is right . Okay . They re imaginary . We made them up . Like the boogie man . The three little pigs , Pinocchio , mother goose , shit like that . Rights are an idea . They re just imaginary . They re a cute idea . Cute . But that s all cute and fictional . But if you think you do have rights , let me ask you this . Where do they come from ? People say , well , they come from God . They re God given rights . Oh , fuck here we go again . Here we go again . The God , excuse the last refuge of a man with no answers and no argument that came from God . Anything we can t describe must have come from God . Personally , folks , I believe that if your rights came from God , he would have given you the right to some food every day and he would have given you the right to a roof over your head . God would have been looking out for you . God would have been looking out for you . You know that ? He would have been worried about making sure you have a gun so you could get drunk on Sunday night and kill your girlfriend s parents . But let s say , sure , let s say God gave us these rights . Why would he give us a certain number of rights ? The Bill of Rights in this country has 10 stipulations , okay ? 10 rights . And apparently God was doing sloppy work that week because we ve had to amend the Bill of Rights an additional 17 times . So God forgot a couple of things like slavery . Just fucking slipped his mind . But let s say God gave us the original 10 . He gave the British 13 . The British Bill of Rights has 13 stipulations . The Germans have 29 . The Belgians have 25 . The Swedish have only six . And some people in the world have no rights at all . What kind of a fucking goddamn God given deal is that ? No rights at all . Why would God give different people in different countries different numbers of different rights ? Boredom ? Amusement ? Bad arithmetic ? Do we find out a long last after all this time that God is weak in math skills ? Doesn t sound like divine planning to me . Sounds more like human planning . Sounds more like one group trying to control another group . In other words , business is usual in America . Now , if you think you do have rights , one last assignment for you . </s> <s> Next time you re at the computer , get on the internet , go to Wikipedia . When you get to Wikipedia , in the search field for Wikipedia , I want you to type in Japanese Americans 1942 . And you ll find out all about your precious fucking rights , okay ? All right . You know about it . You know about it . In 1942 , there were 110 , 000 Japanese American citizens and good standing , law abiding people who were thrown into internment camps , simply because their parents were born in the wrong country . That s all they did wrong . They had no right to a lawyer , no right to a fair trial , no right to a jury of their peers , no right to do process of any kind . The only right they had , right this way , into the internment camps . Just when these American citizens needed their rights the most , their government shook them away . And rights aren t rights of someone can take them away . They re privileges . That s all we ve ever had in this country is a bill of temporary privileges . And if you read the news even badly , you know that every year the list gets shorter and shorter and shorter . You see how it s sooner or later ? Yeah . Sooner or later the people in this country are going to realize the government does not give a fuck about them . Government doesn t care about you or your children or your rights or your welfare or your safety . It simply doesn t give a fuck about you . It s interesting in its own power . That s the only thing keeping it and expanding it wherever possible . The interesting thing about this country is they talk about how we have freedom of choice . You know we have freedom of choice . It s an important thing , limited choice . Two political parties essentially . Two . Big media companies . Five . Six . Max . Yeah . All companies down to three now I think . Overall . Three or four . Banks . The big banks . The big brokerage houses . The big accounting firms . All of the things that are important reduced in choice . Newspapers in the city . How many ? Four . Now it s one or two . The dome by the same people and they also own a radio station and a TV station . But jelly beans . Thirty two flavors . All the things that don t matter . The unimportant things . A lot of choices . You know what I say ? You know what your freedom of choice is in America . Paperoplastic . That s it . It comes down to paperplastic . Cash or charge . Isle or window . Smoking or non smoking . Talk or Pepsi . These are your choices . Everything else is kind of laid out for you . You get to do what they really want . They want to own this country . They do what they want . Speaking of our choices being usurped or taken away from us . </s> <s> What do you make of ? And I m fasted to ask you this because all the things that you ve been talking about for years are , I mean , we ve come full circle on this stuff . That s why I was so fast they didn t thank you for coming on the program . But here we are now , you know , thirty years after you were talking about it , with this huge debate , this huge fight about whether or not our civil liberties are being taken away from us . What are your thoughts on ? Well , I think if you looked at the record of laws which have been passed in the last thirty to forty years , there s a thing called social hysteria . Social hysteria is whipped up generally by the media . Crime . In Nixon s time , crime was the big social hysteria issue . There s too much crime . The coddling , the courts are coddling . The criminals , we have to tougher laws . So a lot of civil liberties went away in terms of the rights of criminals and the rights of the accused and people going on trial . These were limited . They were cut down . These rights which are guaranteed by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights . Another social hysteria , drugs . The drug thing happened . Same thing . Big , big , flow of drugs . We re going to fight the drugs . We need newer tougher laws . We need draconian sentences . We need to be able to go into houses . We need to be able to do this . We have reasonable reasons . All of these shortcuts have resulted in less liberties because of social hysteria . The media whips up the frenzy . People get all excited . The legislature passes it . The president s , the executive signs it . And the judges , then the judicial branch , okay , sometime later when it gets to them . And what has happened is you have less freedom , less liberties , less civil liberties , less rights . And the third social hysteria is terrorism . That was whipped up . Now , it s a little more cause there . You look at the 9 11 . It s a very dramatic event . But that too has been used with this Patriot Act to reduce our liberties . They say , well , if you have nothing to hide , what are you worried about ? You know that all along ? Yeah . Yeah . Tell me about the people that are , you know , just getting out of prison because of the DNA . They forget it . Had nothing to hide . It s just , listen , this country is owned by the ownership class . They do pretty much what they want . I figured it s like a freak show . Here s what I do . Know what I do ? To me , if you re born in the world , you get a ticket to the freak show . </s> <s> If you re born in America , you got a front row seat . So some people are in the freak show . We got our freaks . Then some people , they want to fix the freaks . These are the ACLU lawyers , environmentalists . We want to fix the freaks . We want to fix them . Oh , in that trouble , let s do this . Then there are folks who just watch the freak show , as me . And some of us get to write about it and talk about it . Right . And I do that . That s you too . Yeah . And I say , look at you . I look how badly you re doing . How did you do this to yourself ? Why did you let them do this to you ? Now , there s one thing you might have noticed . I don t complain about politicians . Everybody complains about politicians . Everybody says they suck . Well , where do people think these politicians come from ? They don t fall out of the sky . They don t pass through a membrane from another reality . They come from American parents . And American families , American homes , American schools , American churches , American businesses , and American universities . And they re elected by American citizens . This is the best we can do , folks . This is what we have to offer . It s what our system produces . Garbage in , garbage out . If you have selfish ignorant citizens , if you have selfish ignorant citizens , you re going to get selfish ignorant leaders . In turn , let me say , I m going to be any good . You re just going to wind up with a brand new bunch of selfish ignorant Americans . So maybe , maybe , maybe it s not the politicians who suck . Maybe something else sucks around here . Like the public . Yeah , the public sucks . There s a nice campaign slogan for somebody . The public sucks . Fuck hope . Fuck hope . Because if it s really just the fault of these politicians , then where are all the other bright people of conscience ? Where are all the bright honest , intelligent Americans ready to step in and save the nation and lead the way ? We don t have people like that in this country . Everybody s at the mall . Stratchin his ass , picking his nose , taking his credit card out of his fanny pack and buying a pair of sneakers with lights in them . LAUGHTER So I have solved this little political dilemma for myself in a very simple way . On election day , I stay home . I don t vote . Fuck them . Fuck them . I don t vote . Two reasons . Two reasons I don t vote . First of all , it s meaningless . This country was bought and sold and paid for a long time ago . The shit they shuffle around every four years . </s> <s> Broom . Broom . Broom . Doesn t mean a fucking thing . And secondly , I don t vote . Because I believe if you vote , you have no right to complain . People like to twist that around . I know . They say , well , if you don t vote , you have no right to complain . But where s the logic in that ? If you vote , and you elect dishonest , incompetent people , and they get into office and screw everything up , well , you are responsible for what they have done . You caused the problem . You voted them in . You have no right to complain . I , on the other hand , who did not vote , who did not vote , who in fact did not even leave the house on election day . In the no way responsible for what these people have done . And I ve every right to complain as loud as I want about the mess you created that I had nothing to do with . So I know that a little later on this year , you re going to have another one of those really swell presidential elections that you like so much . You ll enjoy yourselves . It ll be a lot of fun . I m sure as soon as the election is over , your country will improve immediately . As for me , I ll be home on that day doing essentially the same thing as you , the only differences . When I get finished masturbating , I m going to have a little something to show for it folks . Yeah , it s all bullshit folks . It s bad for you . It s all bullshit . That s what you have to remember as you go through life in this country . It s all bullshit . And it s bad for you . Now , speaking of parents , speaking of bullshit , two ideas which aren t always mutually exclusive , by the way . I d like to mention a special kind of bullshit that has taken hold in this country in the last 30 to 40 years . It s a form of bullshit that really only can be called child worship . It s child worship . It s this excessive devotion to children . I m talking about today s professional parents . These obsessive diapers sniffers who are over scheduling and over managing their children and robbing them of their childhoods . Even the simple act of play . APPLAUSE Even the simple act of playing has been taken away from children and put on mommy s schedule in the form of play dates , something that should be spontaneous and free is now being rigidly planned . When does a kid ever get to sit in the yard with a stick anymore ? You know , just sit there with a fucking stick . Do today s kids even know what a stick is ? You know ? But you know something . </s> <s> A kid shouldn t be wasted as time would have stick anyway . If he s four years old , he should be home studying for his kindergarten entrance exams . Do you know about that shit all they have now ? Yeah , yeah . There are places that have kindergarten entrance exams . The poor little fuck . The poor little fucking can barely locate his dick . LAUGHTER You know ? And already he s being pressured to succeed . Pressured to succeed for the sake of the parents . Isn t this really just a sophisticated form of child abuse ? And speaking of that , speaking of child abuse . APPLAUSE Speaking of child abuse , next up , grade school . Grade school , where he won t be allowed to play tag because it encourages victimization . And he won t be allowed to play dodgeball because it s exclusionary and it promotes aggression . Standing around is still OK . Standing around is still permitted , but it won t be prolonged because sooner or later , some kid is going to be standing around and his foot will fall asleep and his parents will sue the school and it ll be good by fucking standing around . LAUGHTER Yeah . APPLAUSE My last question , George , is that it seems to me you re kind of an icon for someone who can see the bad things going on and but not let it sort of harden your heart , not let it get into you and screw up your either mental state or your emotional state . Do you have any advice for people on how you can still stay engaged in the world and not just go insane with anger and resentment ? Become a spectator , that s what I am . I have found that over the last 20 to 30 years , somewhere in that span between 20 and 30 years ago , I began to pull away from having a stake in any of this . I don t really have an emotional stake in the outcome anymore in terms of my caring . I don t really give a fuck when you get right down to it . I don t care what happens to my species because I think this species has squandered great gifts , namely , and especially , the gift of this mind we have , the brain , brain flash mind , which is able to distinguish between subject and object as a starter and able to do a lot of abstract things that should have led us better places . And the opposable famine walking erect in that whole package , we should certainly have done better than to embrace superstitious religious belief that rules us and leads us and the pursuit of goods and profits and territory and power . That s what we turned into . And I think the same is true of this culture . I have also found myself pulling away from this culture and not caring about the outcome because I think the same thing is true . This culture , the country , the American country was given great gift . </s> <s> It developed great gifts on its own at the beginning . And I think we squandered these ideals , these noble purposes and ideals that we began with . And we went off the track because of the prosperity , primarily . We were always infected with the religious thing . That was always there underneath everything . But the prosperity led to greed and possessiveness and wanting to own things and have them for their own sake . And now the American people politically have been brought off . Have been completely silenced and brought off by gizmos and toys . And that s a line from the current show . And it s just a shame . So I pulled away emotionally and I said , you know what , fuck them . Let them do what they wanted you . I m going to enjoy this shit . That s a spectator . And I look at it as a show . It s a big circus . It s a big parade , whatever you want to metaphor you want to use . I think of it as the free show . I like to say this . When you re born in this world , you re given a ticket to the free show . When you re born in America , you re given a front row seat . And man , I m sitting there and I have my notebook out . And I m enjoying the show . And I wish I could live a thousand years to watch this all develop . The rise of Russia , the rise of China , the marginalization of Europe , the decline of the white race . It s going to be an amazing story as it develops . And I just wish I could see it all . I m 70 now . I ve probably lived between 90 and 100 , I think . And I ll get to see some of it . But it is an interesting , exciting thing to watch if you can detach yourself emotionally . And that s the end of that . That s the best way to swallow all that stuff and believe it and still walk down the street singing a happy , happy to sit in . There s no anger in it . There s no anger , there s no emotional speak . But it didn t happen . And one of the reasons , one of the reasons is because we were using that soft language , that language is to take the life out of life . And it is a function of time . It does keep getting worse . In other examples , sometimes during my life , sometimes during my life , toilet paper became bathroom tissue . I wasn t notified of this . No one asked me if I agreed with it . It just happened . Toilet paper became bathroom tissue . Sneakers became running shoes . False teeth became dental appliances . </s> <s> Medicine became medication . Information became directory assistance . The dump became the landfill . Car crashes became automobile accidents . Partly cloudy became partly sunny . Motels became motor lodges . House trailers became mobile homes . Use cars became previously owned transportation . Room service became guest room dining and constipation became occasional irregularity . When I was a little kid , if I got sick , they wanted me to go to the hospital and see the doctor . Now they want me to go to a health maintenance organization or a wellness center to consult a health care delivery professional . Poor people used to live in slums . Now the economically disadvantaged occupies substandard housing in the inner cities . And they re broke . They re broke . They don t have a negative cash flow position . They re fucking broke . Because a lot of them were fired . You know , fired , management wanted to curtail redundancies in the human resources area . So many people are no longer viable members of the workforce . Smug , greedy , well fed , white people have invented a language to conceal this . It s as simple as that . The CIA doesn t kill anybody anymore . They neutralize people . They depopulate the area . The government doesn t lie and engages in disinformation . The Pentagon actually measures nuclear radiation and something they call sunshine units . Israeli murderers are called commandos . Arab commandos are called terrorists . Contra killers are called freedom fighters . Well if crime fighters fight crime and firefighters fight fire , what do freedom fighters fight ? They never mention that part of it to us . They never mention that part of it . And some of this stuff is just silly . We know . We all know that . Like on the airlines , they say they want a pre board . Oh , what the hell is pre board ? What does that mean ? To get on before you get on ? They say they re going to pre board those passengers in need of special assistance . Disciples . Civil honest , direct language . There s no shame attached to the word cripple that I can find in any dictionary . No shame attached to it . In fact , it s a word used in Bible translations . Jesus healed the cripples . Doesn t take seven words to describe that condition . But we don t have any cripples in this country anymore . We have the physically challenged . Is that a grotesque enough evasion for you ? How about differently abled ? I ve heard them call that differently abled . You can t even call these people handicapped anymore . They ll say , we re not handicapped . We re handicapable . These poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change their name of the condition , somehow you ll change the condition . Well , hey , cuss . Doesn t happen . Doesn t happen . We have no more death people in this country hearing impaired . No one s blind anymore , partially cited or visually impaired . We have no more stupid people . Everybody has a learning disorder . Or he s minimally exceptional . How would you like to be told that about your child ? </s> <s> He s minimally exceptional . Oh , thank God for that . Psychologists actually have started calling ugly people , those with severe appearance deficits . It s getting so bad that any day now I expect to hear a rape victim referred to as an unwilling sperm recipient . And we have no more old people in this country . No more old people . We shipped them all away . And we brought in these senior citizens . Isn t that a typically American 20th century phrase , bloodless , lifeless ? No pulse in one of them , a senior citizen . But I ve accepted that one . I ve come to terms with it . I know it s here to stay . We ll never get rid of it . But that s what they re going to be called . So I ll relax on that . But the one I do resist , the one I keep resisting is when they look at an old guy and they ll say , look at him , Dan . He s 90 years young . Imagine the fear of aging that reveals . To not even be able to use the word old to describe someone to have to use the nant in him . And fear of aging is natural . It s universal , isn t it ? We all have that . No one wants to get old . No one wants to die . But we do . So we bullshit ourselves . I started bullshit in myself when I got to my 40s . As soon as I was in my 40s , I d look in the mirror and I d say , well , I guess I m getting older . Older sounds a little better than old , doesn t it ? Sounds like it might even last a little longer . Well , shit , I m getting old . And it s okay because thanks to our fear of death in this country , I won t have to die . I ll pass away . Or I ll expire like a magazine subscription . It happens in the hospital that ll call it a terminal episode . The insurance company will refer to it as negative patient care outcome . And if it s the result of malpractice , they ll say it was a therapeutic misadventure . I m telling you , some of this language makes me want to vomit . Well , maybe not vomit . Makes me want to engage in an involuntary personal protein spill . You got people like this around you . Countries full of them now . People walking around all day long , every minute of the day worried about everything . Worry about the air , worry about the water , worry about the soil . Worry about insecticides , pesticides , food additives , carcinogens . Worry about radon gas , worry about asbestos . Worry about saving endangered species . Let me tell you about endangered species . Saving endangered species is just one more arrogant attempt by humans to control nature . </s> <s> It s arrogant , meddling . It s what got us in trouble in the first place . Doesn t anybody understand that ? Interferring with nature . Over 90 over , way over , 90 of all the species that have ever lived on this planet , ever lived are gone . Woot ! They re extinct . We didn t kill them all . They just disappeared . That s what nature does . They disappear these days at the rate of 25 a day . And I mean regardless of our behavior , irrespective of how we act on this planet , 25 species that we re here today will be gone tomorrow . Let them go gracefully . Leave nature alone . Haven t we done enough ? We re so self important . So self important . Everybody s going to save something now . Save the trees , save the bees , save the whales , save those nails . And the greatest arrogance of all , save the planet . What ? Are these fucking people kidding me ? Save the planet . I m going to have to take care of ourselves yet . We haven t learned how to care for one another . We re going to save the fucking planet . I ll get tired of that shit . Tired of that shit . Tired . I m tired of fucking Earth Day . I m tired of these self righteous and violent medallists , these white bourgeois liberals who think the only thing wrong with this country is there aren t enough bicycle paths . People trying to make the world safe for their volvos . Besides , environmentalists don t give a shit about the planet . They don t care about the planet . Not in the abstract . They don t . Not in the abstract . They don t . You know what they re interested in ? A clean place to live . Their own habitat . The word that someday in the future they might be personally inconvenienced . Narrow , un enlightened self interest doesn t impress me . Besides , there is nothing wrong with the planet . Nothing wrong with the planet . The planet is fine . The people are fucked . Difference . Difference . The planet is fine . Compared to the people , the planet is doing great . It s been here for 1 . 5 billion years . Do you ever think about the arithmetic ? Planet has been here for 1 . 5 billion years . We ve been here what ? 100 , 000 ? Maybe 200 , 000 ? And we ve only been engaged in heavy industry for a little over 200 years . 200 years versus 4 . 5 billion . And we have the conceit to think that somehow we re a threat . That somehow we re going to put in jeopardy . This beautiful little blue green ball . It s just a floating around the sun . The planet has been through a lot worse than us . Then through all kinds of things worse than us . Then through earthquakes , volcanoes , plate tictonics , continental drift , solar flares , sunspots , magnetic storms , the magnetic reversal of the poles . Hundreds of thousands of years of bombardment by comets and asteroids and meteors , world wide floods , tidal waves , worldwide fires , erosion , cosmic rays , recurring ice ages . </s> <s> And we think some plastic bags and some aluminum cans are going to make a difference . The planet . The planet . The planet isn t going anywhere . We are . We re going away . Pack your shit , folks . We re going away . And we won t leave much of a trace , either . Thank God for that . Maybe a little styrofoam . Maybe . Little styrofoam . The planet will be here . It will be long gone . Just another failed mutation . Just another closed end biological mistake . An evolutionary code to sack . The planet will shake us off like a bad case of fleas . A surface nuisance . You wonder how the planet s doing ? Ask those people at Pompeii who are frozen into position from volcanic ash . How the planet s doing . One of the planets all right , ask those people in Mexico City or Armenia or a hundred other places buried under thousands of tons of earthquake rubble if they feel like a threat to the planet this week . How about those people in Kiloayahauai who build their homes right next to an active volcano ? And then wonder why they have lava in the living room . The planet will be here for a long , long , long time after we re gone and it will heal itself . It will cleanse itself because that s what it does . It s a self correcting system . The air in the water will recover . The earth will be renewed . If it s true , the plastic is not degradable . Well , the planet will simply incorporate plastic into a new paradigm , the earth plus plastic . The earth doesn t share our prejudice towards plastic . Plastic came out of the earth . The earth probably sees plastic as just another one of its children . Could be the only reason the earth allowed us to be spawned from it in the first place . It wanted plastic for itself . Didn t know how to make it . Me and us . Could be the answer to our age old philosophical question . Why are we here ? Plastic . Plastic . Oh . You know , comedians never get old . They don t . They get old , but they live to be 150 George Carlin , the great George Carlin just turned 70 . And to celebrate his 50 years in show business , he s just released a DVD collection of always comedy specials . And it s called George Carlin , all my stuff . Please welcome comedy legend , George Carlin . APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE APPLAUSE You re the seaward . That s a very neat one . Let s see what I see . Let s see what I see . I see it . Let s see it . Whoo ! Can t do it . I don t have the falsetto anymore . You re just being able to sing some nice high tenor and always . Like that guy , what were you having ? He s doing , whoa ! He went , whoa ! So , can t get the falsetto . That s all right . So George , before we talk about an old you re getting . Yeah . </s> <s> Yeah . How does it feel to be 70 in the business ? Does it feel any different ? No , it really does . It does . No . You know the time has passed . And you know you re getting better at what you do . You re supposed to . Anything you do , you better get better at it . Yeah . You better stop doing it . And so , you know what George Burns said . He said there are five stages of life . Childhood , adulthood , middle age , old age , and you look great . And that s where I m at now . The people there don t say , hey , you look great . You know what you said . But you re still funny . I mean , funny never goes away unless you get a dementia or something . No , right . And they didn t even find it . That s right . Potentially . Now the thing is , it s not just the funny but the ideas get richer . The writing . I found out at one point . I used to always , when I was a beginning comic , who first 20 years probably , I referred to myself as a comedian who wrote his own material because I was proud of that . A lot of comedians didn t . A comedian wrote his own material . Then one day I sort of realized , after the fact a few years , that I d become a writer who performed his own material . And that really made a difference in my mind , in my heart . I just matured into that . I had the skills to be a writer all along apparently . And I was using them effectively but in a little more of a frivolous way at first . And later , the experience is very good thing because it gives you something richer against which to compare what you re seeing . When you re 20 and you see X , Y , and Z , it bounces off a very thin wall . If you re 60 and you see the same thing , boy , it can sit in there and it goes around a little bit and everything . And it s a richer output . So that s what I gained just from getting older . Do you think that you look at comedy now ? Do you think that you could , if you were starting out today , would there be a place for you ? I had that question recently , slightly different same idea . And I thought , gee , if I were starting today , if I were 20 , I wouldn t even know if I d be the same person at 20 . And that I was then , not with all of the things that would have happened between , let s say , five and 20 , the technology , the demands , and the way the parents , my mother would never would have been one of these professional parents . But I would have been a different person . And it would have been harder to start because I did my career on my own terms . </s> <s> And I don t know how many people get to do that anymore . I think there are too many expectations , there are too many pathways and rules . And true rebels don t seem to be around very much . What would you say ? I would say , do what you love , do it well , and if people patch on the back for it , you got it . The secret to happiness is finding something you love and doing it well and then being recognized for it . Someone , even if it s one person who says you re doing a great job or if it s applause , but those three things together , when I first changed the kind of stuff I was doing in the late 60s , I had been a suit and tie comic out of the 50s and I had short hair and all that . And I realized I was doing the wrong thing for the wrong people . And I let myself change into a more freer , more of a , if you can use the word hippie , look and attitude . And I realized that I said to my wife at that time when I changed , I said , you know , even if I only filled coffee houses , three days a week for the rest of my life , I d be happy doing that . And when you let go of goals and stuff , I mean the attachment to goals , that s when things come to you . You should have a name point , but not a thing like that . Well , I want to ask you , George , because you have , it is to celebrate the 50 years in show business , all of your HBO specials are now in a collection called All My Stuff . And I have , as a stand up comic , I m just so excited . I have my favorite routines that you do . What is , what is some of the most memorable routines in here ? Well , the time , it was a year or two later that I looked back and I had that realization that I ve really become a writer , was 1992 show called Jammin in New York , which was in Madison Square Garden , the theater there , 6500 people . It was live , it was the first one they did live on HBO . It was my hometown , the place was full , and it was electric . And I had essays for the first time I was doing essays rather than bits . These were developed ideas that had a little bit of a serious overtone to them , but were relieved with laughter and irony all along . And after that start to sink in , I look back and I thought , well , see , that was a kind of pivotal point . So there s a thing in there called the planet is fine . It s in the jammin in New York . The planet is fine , the people are . . . Because everybody s running around trying to save the planet . The planet doesn t need that . The planet will take care of itself . People are selfish , and that s what they re doing . They re trying to save the planet for themselves to have a nicer place to live . They don t care about the planet in theory . </s> <s> They just care about having a comfortable place . And these people with the fires and the floods and everything , they overbuild , they put nature to the test and they get what s coming to them . That s what I say . Well , that s what I m harsh . That s what s happening . And I can t wait for the sea levels to rise . I can t wait for some of these cities to do so . I can t swim , George . There are places that are going to go where the map is going to change and that s because the real nature . . . People think nature is outside of them . They don t take into them the idea that we are part of it . They say , well , we re going for a nature walk . We re going to the country because we like nature . Nature is in here . And if you re in two with it like the Indians , the Hopes especially , the balance of life , the balance , the harmony of nature , if you understand that , you don t overbuild . You don t do all this more on stuff . There are too many people . . . Let s go after them . The polluting , the operations , people who do it . It s a symphony . Everybody s in the band . It s not just one group . People want their goodies . They want their toys . Everybody wants the newest gizmo . We re slaves to gizmos and toys . They got it today . I don t think they re unhappy . Everybody wants a cell phone that will make pancakes and that will make them happy . And it doesn t make them happy when we watch this . Thank you , George , because I want to let you guys know you are all messed up . We ve been planning this fine . We are messed up . But if you are in New York City , Thursday , George will be signing DVDs at the borders on Wall Street from noon to 2pm . You ve got to be there . And we re going to be right back with James Lipton .

        "transcript": "<s> Give it up for my help , Mr . Jim ! Jeffree ! Hey ! Hello ! Nice guy ! Big down ! That was . . . that was very nice . Alright , start with the joke . Every time I sneeze , some asshole in the room goes , do you know the sensation of a sneeze is one eighth of an orgasm ? I don t know if you ve heard this myth , but that s what people say . That s why when I m fucking a chick , I keep a bit of pepper on the bedside table . And as I m coming , I chuck it in a face . Because he deserves something . Well , thank you . I used to , for a while , date Michael Phelps ex girlfriend . And that sounds like a joke , but it s true , I dated Michael Phelps ex girlfriend . And I ll tell you something about fucking Michael Phelps ex girlfriend . You put no effort in , because no matter how good you think you re fucking her , you re not fucking her as good as the greatest Olympian that s ever lived . This guy , 6 8 , has size 20 feet and holds his breath for a living . Right ? He puts 10 , 000 calories a day . You know , he s just fucking her and drinking Red Bull and eating chocolate bars . And I m there coughing cigarette flame up on her back . And she always used Mike against me . I call him Mike now . She goes , Mike , pour me his handbag . Mike pour me these shoes and I ll be like , Mike looks like he has down syndrome . I don t you ever mention that . And we don t know for sure that I m not a better swimmer . I ve never timed myself when I get in the pool , it s for pleasure not to show off in competition . I can tell you if I ever finish a lap of an Olympic sized pool , I ll be really , really tired . And you can only assume from that that I ve been going extraordinarily fast . Mike took me here , Mike took me there , Mike cheated on you with Miss California . And I could never do that to you . It s not that I wouldn t . I just couldn t . It s Miss California , that bitch has got to be fucking tasty . Like I m on the TV a bit , I m a minus celebrity , I could fuck like Miss Delaware . It s coming to mind . I don t even know where Delaware is , but she sounds fucking ugly Miss Delaware , aren t you ? But I ve got a girlfriend now , she s in the room . I ve got a girlfriend , she s moved into the house , serious relationship . I ll tell you what I ve been doing with the last 12 years of my life . For the last 12 years of my life , I ve been traveling around the world having sex with random women . And my girlfriend has told me that that s a really sad way to live your life and kind of depressing . </s> <s> And it s weird you know , because it felt like fun . I remember a lot of smiling back in the day . I have vivid memories of high fiving a lot . I , I think I d she s come along to tell me that I was mistaken . You might be asking why when I want to settle down , then I am at the age , you know , 35 , where I m thinking of the future , I would like to be a father one day . I think I would be a great dad , I really do . I just don t think I d be a good husband and there s a problem . Because you can t just like me to woman , marry her , get a pregnant , she has the child , and then you divorce her in the first year , that s automatic bad dad territory . It doesn t matter how many ball games take the little cut to you re a bad fucking dad . So I think the only way up for me is to like me to woman , marry her , get a pregnant , she has the child , and then if she could die , that would really help me out . Because your kid couldn t hate you then , because I m doing my best , your mom s dead , you know . But I ve looked into it and not as easy as you might think , it turns out that family ill women don t want to get pregnant , they re all about them and what they re up to and there is you . The family ill are very fucking high maintenance if you ask me , so I need to find a woman who doesn t know she s dying and that s a whole new set of complications . So I need to be a friend of Doctor , that Doctor will have like a cancerous woman come into his office and he ll be like , oh you re fine , get out of here , you re wasting my time , congratulations on the weight loss . Then he ll ring me up and go , I ve got one and I ll be like , yay ! And then I ll give him a couple of free tickets to his show , we call it even . And I d meet the girl , apparently charming , I d get a married , I d get a pregnant , she d have the child , and then if she could die , that would get me out of a bind . Like I don t want to die during childbirth , I m not a fucking animal , you know , like a few years later after the Kid Good Walk and Talk and wipe its unass and open the fridge and take care of itself to a certain extent . And I think I want a daughter , I think that would suit me to have a little three year old daughter , Eliza , I ve already named her . So , pitching me Jim Jeffries with little Eliza struggling through life , hey , just the two of us , the mum s fucking dead , she s long gone . </s> <s> It s just the two of us , I do what I can , I take her on the road with me because I can t leave her with anyone , she s all I ve got left . I m fucking adorable ! There is a woman in this room that doesn t want to suck that guy s cock , that s about a sexist I get with the dead fucking wife raising a little girl . And I would play that card every single day as well , I d be like an adiant of a little Eliza and as the hot waitress walked by I d go , no , mummies never coming back . And then when the wages came up I d go , no , no , nothing for me , thank you so much . But I think someone might like an ice cream Sunday ! It s the first birthday without her mother . No , no , no , it s okay , we re okay . Sometimes I think she takes care of me . You know I ll be happening later on that evening , I ll be getting my dick sucked and the free Sunday . And I raised a kid good too , no fucking around . Raised a kid the same way that I was raised , beat the fuck out of it . My mother broke both my brother s legs , not both my brothers , one brother ! Both his fucking legs ! Scottie was under the bed going , oh no , why don t I go out to school and mum s going , get out right now , you re going to school and he was like , no , I m not , you can t make me and she went , you don t think I can make you and then Scott went , fuck off ! Now , Gunter wasn t taking that . She reached under , grabbed him by the shirt , pulled him backwards , yanked him upwards so he shined , shouted against the bed frame and the floor . Now on the upside , didn t go to school that day . Got a couple of extra days off to relax . Fogging soft , you soft people , I m telling you , you re this kind , this self esteem and giving every child a fucking medal if it runs a race in it . There are two fucking lots of people in this world , winners and fucking losers , right ? You might not be a winner at everything , you might not be a loser at everything but you won t find out what the fuck you re good at if they tell you you re fucking good at everything . You here in America are the most powerful country that s ever been to coming number 27 in education and that s disgusting . You re coming number one in confidence . So you re breeding stupid , confident people . They re the worst employees in the fucking world . So this whole weird number one shit , call it a fucking day , America . China s coming to get you and you can t stop China makers , they re number one in education and they re the bottom of the listing confidence . They re in tire society rotates about honor , respect , dignity , do your homework , learn your fucking violin . </s> <s> So who do you want putting your card together , a little nervous Asian fellow with a drill going , zzzzck . Or this guy , zzzz , perfect . If you can t compete with the Asians , there s not a there smarter , they re not smarter , their infrastructure is infinitely better . The Asians do something that we don t do , they acknowledge stupidity . If you have a classroom , American children , little Johnny isn t keeping up with the other kids , what do you do ? Come on Johnny , you can catch up , we believe in you . What do you think they do in China when fucking may bang isn t throwing the light , eh ? Get out of the way you re done , they talk to the smart kids , you re weighing them down . Go over there and make some shoes and help our economy but leave them alone . You don t acknowledge stupidity and I can fucking prove it . We have a thousand people in the room by a shaman hands , don t do it ironically , don t do this castically . Only do this if you truly believe it . Put up your hand if you truly believe you have a stupid child at home . None of you , well guess what ? It s statistically higher than that . But your child isn t stupid , not your child . Your child has a learning difficulty . That s the definition of stupid . If you have difficulty learning , that s what stupid is . If you find it hard to put information in your head and recall it when you need it , that s textbook stupid . And there s nothing wrong with being stupid . I was taken nice hit it over smart asshole any fucking day of the week , ladies and gentlemen . But let s just acknowledge these people . You know , now I m giving you a good point . Many of you are thinking maybe our kid is a dumb come . You re picturing him in his little league game , he s in the outfield digging a hole with a stick . I ve told you before in one of my other DVDs , this is how you find out if your kid is a dumb come . You are a dumb come . Here s your wife or your husband a dumb come . Guess what your kids are . Your kids are dumb come just like you accept that I ll achieve even less . Now don t be upset by this information . If you re indeed a dumb come with your dumb come spouse , your dumb come kids , your dumb come family with your dumb come friends . Because society is very accommodating to dumb come . In fact there are places where you and your dumb come family can go once a week and meet other dumb come families . And you can sing songs . And it s called the church . And they ve never turned away a group of dumb cats . The church loves dumb cats . Doesn t like the smart but with their constant questions . The smart are always asking questions and that s like fucking cancer to religion . See I ve been going on atheist when I was 15 years old . I remember there was an exact moment . </s> <s> I was digging a hole with a stick . Now if you ve just recently become an atheist try to be cool about it . Especially in this country people use atheism almost like its own religion . Because when you become an atheist you re very angry because you ve been fed so many lies that you become angry . So try to be what I call a good atheist . I used to be a bad atheist . For example I didn t go to a friend s wedding once because I was in a church because I wouldn t set foot in a church . And then I couldn t go to parties because I was always in an corner with a Christian going you re a fucking idiot . And that s no way to live your life . So you re going to live in this world . Have the magic man . Don t have the magic man . I don t give a fuck . And since I have this new sunny disposition . My life s really turned around . I ve got more friends . I tolerate others . And now Godfather the three children and that s retarded . Because these people know me . And they still fucking ask . They still come up and go Jim will you be the child s Godfather . And I m like yes . And then I stand there in church with the priests and the parents and the priest is holding the baby and the priest turns and he goes Jim . Will you spiritually guide this child throughout its life ? Sure . Because I have no problems lying in church . A difference doesn t make . Now there are two reasons why baby is a Christian . There s the real reason which is the church are trying to recruit people who can t talk . Then there s the second reason , the Bible s reasons , God s reason . This is why God wants you to Christian your child . Because if you don t Christian your child and it dies in infancy , it doesn t get into heaven . So if you are religious , your God sounds like a super guy . But if he lets one dead baby into heaven then he has to let all the dead babies into heaven . And before you know it heavens just feel with fucking dead babies . Why be out to move for dead babies ? And let s not act like these babies didn t know what they did . Now it s not lost in me . Then when I tell a joke like that in front of this many people , then in this room there s a good chance there s a couple who lost their child in infancy . I m a comedian , I m meant to make you laugh and I ve just reminded you of the most horrible thing that ever happened to you . And for that I m sorry . But if you aren t smart enough to get a pedophile in a dress to put a small amount of water on the child s forehead , what the fuck did you think was gonna happen ? </s> <s> As far as I m concerned , you re bad parents . And that s why God took your child away from you . Because I think we all know that God makes no mistakes . Maybe you did . You re a bad person . It s weird you re a bad tension in the room now people are still . . . I prefer the laugh drum , you used to laugh . I like this weed because you all know what I do , you see my specialty boy . If I can , these people still get shocked . Right but the thing is , it s not my fans that get shocked or upset . They know what s fucking happening . The problem with these shows are , is that people come in groups . And there s some guy here who s a big fan of mine and he said to six of his friends , you gotta see this guy . We re gonna have a great fucking night . And at this stage of the show he s going , oh no ! Oh , Karen s here . Karen fucking loves God . I m never gonna fuck Karen . Karen . Then afterwards , I ll be outside having a drink and one of the bars around the place . And afterwards Karen will see me and she ll walk up to me with a smile like this . And then once you get really close , you ll go , you re a fucking asshole ! And I ll be like , oh no , you don t want a photo . And then her friends will sort of drag her away . And as she s being dragged away , she ll yell something out like , God loves you . Jesus loves you , some bullshit like that . Because Christians have this belief that there s a man on a cloud that loves them . Let s say he exists . He doesn t fucking love you . I have heard Christians say that my God loves me unconditionally . No such thing as unconditional love . That s a load of fucking bullshit . My mum always says that one out there . My mum always goes , Jim , I love you . No matter what , I love you unconditionally . And I always think to myself , what if I cut one of her tits off ? Whatever it is , got a rusty blade and started hacking into that obese woman s breast . Like , would she still love me ? She might , I m not willing to test it , but I can tell you for sure . I can tell you for sure that God does not love you unconditionally . I have already given you a condition . If you don t put a small amount of water on a baby s forehead , it burns for eternity . That s the condition of a fucking psychopath . </s> <s> Like , if God showed up at a party , he d be the least welcome person in party history . Like , everyone would be having a good time , then someone would go , don t look up . Oh no . God s here . Hey God , how you going ? We didn t know you were going to be here . Yeah , well , fucking everywhere on us . So what the fuck wouldn t I be here ? Well , God , it s really great to have you here . We re really happy you re here . And God s like , everyone , everyone ! Can everyone please be quiet looking at me right now ? I ve come down to tell all of you , I want you all to know that I love all of you unconditionally . And they re like , thanks to that God , we really appreciate that . And they go back to their party . And then God goes , is that all you have to say ? Sorry , God . I just said I love you . Oh , fucking shit , yeah . Um . We love you too . Good , good , good . Because you know if you don t you fucking burn , right ? Yes , God , we really love you . We really love you . Do you love any other gods ? No , we don t . We really don t . Okay , cool . Sorry , everyone . I m sorry . I ve had too much to drink . I m sorry . And then they go back to their party . And obviously God s not getting enough attention . He pipes up again . Everybody ! One last thing . I know you all said you love me . And that s really cool of you . I want you to do one more thing for me now . I want to point out that you won t burn if you don t do this . But go a long way not to burning if you get my fucking drift . Right ? It would be really great if you could all sing songs about me . And they re like , sorry , God . I made the fucking world . Just sing a fucking song . What s the problem ? And they re like , yeah . Yeah , we can do this . Can t we gang ? Let s sing some songs for God . They start singing some gospel music . They begin with God s fucking diggin it . He s just . . . Because let s not forget that God s a white guy . And halfway through this song God starts to turn . Everyone stops singing . Who s the guy in the pink shirt who s enjoying singing ? Oh . Oh , oh , that s Brian and his boyfriend . You know how I like faggots ? Good God , God , God . Come down , calm down . You just said you love everyone . </s> <s> Not faggots either . And then people are trying to calm down . And he s like , don t you fucking touch me . Don t touch me . You faggot lover . They re like , God is probably best you to sleep this party . You re all gonna fucking burn all you fucking cubs . And he goes outside and he s trying to calm himself down . A fucking hate faggots . I couldn t be clear about this . It s in the book for fuck s sake . Everyone s got the book now . Everyone s fucking read the book . Everyone s got the book . And he passes like a young couple holding hands . He s like , hey , hey , hey , you re doing a sad trip . Fucking made that shit . Hey , wait . Wait . Are you too married ? No . Well , don t fuck each other . I hate young people fucking . And I hate faggots . I also hate people eating shrimp . I mention that eight times in my book where I only mention twice that I hate homosexuals . But people seem to really enjoy eating shrimp , so I ve forgotten about that rule . But I m still very certain I hate faggots . And everyone s like , I m so happy to have him in my life . It s constant glow I have in my heart . My pet hate when I m on stage . It doesn t really matter too much in this show because it s being filmed . But I hate it when people have their camera phone up and the video tape on my show when I m doing a gig . For two reasons . It sounds silly , but first reason is simple . There are my jokes . And I don t want you putting them on the internet before I get through a quarter amount of special . Second reason is I m not in charge of the editing . You know , it easier to be to edit that last routine down to , I hate faggots . And I ll be getting interviewed and someone goes , Jim , why do you hate homosexual so much ? And I ll be like , I don t hate homosexuals . And then they d show me the clip and I d be like , oh no ! Ah ! What you don t understand is I was got at the time . God doesn t like homosexuals . And I don t hate gay people and pro gay people , man . I protested for gay marriage . I believe very strongly in gay marriage . I believe if you re a person who s watching this special right now and you don t believe in gay marriage , turn it off . You re a fucking dickhead . I don t want anything to do it . Now , and my reasoning is so simple , right ? If you don t believe in gay marriage , you re a dickhead because it s got nothing to fucking do with you . Doesn t matter . It doesn t matter who loves , who wants to be with , who . It s not your fucking business . Not your fucking business . If you hate gay marriage , you know what you should do ? Don t marry a gay person . </s> <s> That ll be your little way of getting around . Are that all fucking show the gay ? Is he ? I like the gay . They re fucking suit me . I m this class studied musical theatre at university . I m wearing leather without a shirt underneath . I would love to be gay . But tell you what , because I m a man s man . I like men . Men like me . We like each other . I hate women . Women hate me . We hate each other . The only reason I couldn t be gay is because I can never fuck a man . Because I can never fuck something that I respect . Who s gay ? Are they good fucking joke ? You know what that joke ? That jokes what I call an awkward car ride home . You know how many men are going to be driving home with their girlfriends or wives this evening and they have to do this one . They ve got to go . What joke ? Oh , don t remember that joke . I laughed at it . Me . That doesn t sound like me . You re saying I stood up and clapped ? I was probably laughing about the joke before it . I was like , where God hated homosexuals . How do I know that that joke was before it if I didn t know that this joke even existed ? Your mother s a cant . But still some stories . This first story . The first bit of this story should all you know in the same way that you know things like don t kill people . Try not to rape . When you re an airplane , there s a thing called plane etiquette and it goes like this . Window gets an armrest in a wall . Middle gets two armrests . Ile gets an armrest and a little bit of extra leg . We re not fucking animals , we live in a society . I was on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston and I had the middle seat and that sucks balls . So I was sitting there with two armrests . Next to me is petite young laddy , she s doing her job armrest wall . I m in the middle , two armrests . Sitting next to me here is a great big black man who s as gay as the day is long . He sits down next to me and we do the niceties . Hello , hello . When no issue whatsoever , he sees my elbow there and he just went chalk and I went . . . No , I m pretty upset but he s a big fucking guy and it s a long flight . So there s no need to get into an argument . So I have that argument that you re having in your head where the other person doesn t know you re having an argument . Where you re like , you re a fucking asshole . If you said this and I would say , well good sir , I think you re mistaken . </s> <s> So I sit there festering for like 45 minutes and eventually the ass tutors comes to the drink cart . Now why am I ass tutors ? Whenever you watch a movie set in the 60s and they show ass tutors or an old TV show , they show like Pam Am or something . So I used to pick ass tutors as these hot young things with a pill box hat , a little bun and big tits and a small waist and holding a bag . I don t think any of those women have retired . This thing was just being propped up by the drink cart . 50 years have recycled air and made a skin drip off a skull like the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark . She comes up , the guy reaches over for his drink and he s pretzels , arm rest open , bang ! I m back in . I m not fucking going anywhere either . He puts all of his things down and he s train , he goes to put his elbow back but he fucking can t . He can t because there s a wall there for Jim Jeffries and he can t fucking move it . And he s pushing , he s pushing and I m acting like a cow fillet like this but casual like like . Then he gets his fists like this and he s am like that and he s pushing really hard back and I m trying to do that casual . But he s much bigger than me in events I have to give in and I just went chalk . So I turned to him and said what needed to be said . Why are you such a cunt ? Now I understand that that word in this country isn t as popular as maybe it should be . People were freaking the fuck out . Now he s going he did he just said it I heard him say it . Called that man a C bomb I heard him say it Bob . Called the man a C bomb Bob . And he was shocked as well he turned to him and went excuse me . What did you just call me ? Been in for a penny in for a pound right ? And I was there going a cunt sir . I called you a cunt and he said are you upset because you re trying to take my armrests and I went you don t know plain etiquette . Window gets an armrest in the wall middle gets to armrest . I ll get to armrests a little bit of extra leg . We re not fucking animals we live in a society . And the people that initially hated me agreed with me like he is right about that that is true . That is true . You do live in a society . And he went oh I m only taking the back of the armrest you can have the rest of the armrest and I went you take the back . You take the whole fucking thing . No one gives a fuck about the front of the armrest . No one s ever gone thanks for the front of the armrest . I said it s not just that you re taking my armrest . Your elbow is coming over the armrest and it s digging into my rib cage . </s> <s> And he said well maybe if you lost some weight I know . I was I was close back don t know what the fuck it s saying . I just turned to a when you bitchy queen . Now everyone the pain has lost their fucking shit the movie . The movie can fuck off . Made no one s watching the fucking movie . I m the entertainment now . The ass jeer has come running back on her walker . She comes after us and she goes what s going on here ? And I said I want this fucking ass all away from me . And she said service is not the situation to be swearing in . I went yes it is . We re having a fight . And she went well there s no need for name calling . I called the guy bitchy queen so I sort of get what she s saying . And I turned her and said you know what you re right . There is never a need for name calling . But as a proud gay man myself . I feel like I ve earned the right to say such words . She apologized . The gay guy knows I m fucking lying . He s fagging the fuck out . And the ass just went get everyone calmed down . What s the problem here ? He s trying to take my arm rest and the ass jeers went everyone knows the middle gets two arm rests . And I went see she goes I m going to have to break you two up . And I went towards the man said sir you re going to have to find a seat at the back of the plane . I m victorious . I stand up . I bash my head on the thing . I pointed the man . And I went get to the back of the plane . Now a lot of people on that plane hadn t seen the rest of the argument . All they have seen is me pointing at a black man yelling get to the back of the plane . Things got real awkward real fucking quick . I didn t know what I had done yet . People were yelling at me calling me a racist and I was like I know who but how do you know who . Then a guy threw a bag of peanuts at the back of my head and said sit down you lie me bastard . And I was like that s the British I m Australian you fucking racist . Which would have made a lot of sense if being British or Australian was a race and not a nationality . But at that stage I was clutching the straws really . So I go shit back down in his old chair where you got the empty seat between us being the girl pounded out . Now later on the flight I m walking up the back of the plane to the toilet . And I want to see the guy because I want to go . </s> <s> And I get all the way to the back of the plane I don t see him anywhere about to go in the toilet . And then I see his leg around the corner . There were no more seats . This is a full flight . He s sitting in the ass to us landing seat that folds down with a seat belt over the top like he s in a fucking go cart . I pulled my head around the corner and I went no arm rest here dickhead . And the ass to us when you get back to your seat and run away like a child like . So for learning I go sit back down in his old seat now the ass to us is taken . So she s taking my old seat in the middle and she fucking hates me and I m taking both arm rest fucker . And that s my landing . The guy of the all leans over and goes excuse me . You re Jim Jeffries right ? I m like , yeah man how you doing ? And he went , I had no idea you were gay . Fucking yeah . Ah , I caught . I threatened any like fucking techno DJ guys watching this special . To make some song out of hate faggots . I like cock . It s going to be popular in Europe . Now this last story happened five years ago and involves a very famous famous movie star comedian . I won t say his name as he comes out of this story very poorly . Five years ago I was performing at the Just Flask comedy festival in Montreal . I was out there before my career taking off over here a bit . I was out there supporting a very famous comedian . I was just doing the 10 minute warm up in a big theatre like this . For me it was a great stage in my career because I ve never been flown overseas to a gig . I ve never met a movie star , never performed in a theatre . It was exciting times . I get to the stage door after the gig and there s like 300 people waiting in the alleyway just to get this guy s photo or an autograph for some . And I m standing up to the side like a bit of a douchebag like . And then these two 18 year old French Canadian girls come up and start talking to me . Now one of them is all hot and 18 and more . And the other one is more . . . . . . fat . So . . . I m talking to the two girls . Eventually the movie star stops doing photos and he walks over and the girls lose their fucking shit . We go out drinking . It gets like four in the morning and they yell last orders . Now every man knows this moment in the night . </s> <s> You ve been working on a girl for hours . You haven t closed the deal . They ve turned the lights on . They ve yelled last orders and you re in that pressure cooker of time where you have to go , ah you want to fuck ? Right so . . . I m going to let you in on a little secret which a lot of comedians don t tell you what I did in this situation . I said to the girl and said , hey let s stay out drinking and the girls go , we can t . All the bars are shut and I said not the bar back at our hotel . The bar at our hotel is still open . Now I should mention at this stage of the story that I knew full well that the bar at the hotel was not open . We get back to the hotel , the bar is shut and I m like this , oh no ! This is fucking bullshit . They fuck I have drinks up in my room and then the girls come up to the room and the spiderweb of deceit is complete . Now we re all out there drinking after about 15 minutes the other comedian becomes what I can only call rapy . He wanted the two girls to kiss each other but he wasn t doing that drunk and herber you two start kissing . He was grabbing the back of each of their heads , going do it , kiss each other , do it ! Now I was sort of in awe of this guy so I was kind of nervous so I was like , ah don t do that . But there s a bit of my brain going but if you pull this off I m right there with you . The guy sort of checks himself very quickly and he s like , oh I m sorry Jim I m sorry girls I don t know what came over me and we forgive him rather quickly . But we continue on drinking about 40 minutes later we run out of coke or coal to mix with the jack Daniels so I go to the vending machine to get more coke . I come back in with all these cans of coke under my arm . Obviously since I ve been away the rapiness has surged back through his veins because he now has one of the girls pinned up against the wall and he s tearing out of top the other girls on his back trying to fight him off . Now as exciting as it was to see my first rape I really felt like I should intervene . But I was nervous so I was kind of like George McFly from back to the future . Hey you ! You get your damn hands off her . And he gave me the most evil look I ve ever had from another person . He slammed that girl against the wall he fought the other one off his back and he looked at me and he goes , I m going to make sure you never work with me again . And you girls can fuck off as well . I m going to out of bed then he storms out of the room and he slams it all behind him . Now the girls are about to cry so I m going to keep things up beat . </s> <s> You know when you were the child and the child s fallen over and there s a small window of time where the child doesn t know it s hurt at all ? And if you just go , wow ! The kid s all he goes , I don t know if I was happened . So he stormed out the girls and he went , whoa ! Someone had too much to drink now didn t they ? Don t cry . I m not going to rape you . Look , look , look , look , look , look . Oh , lock the door . Okay ? He can t get back in but you can t get out . No , I m joking , I m joking , I m joking , I m joking , I m joking , I m joking , I m joking , I m joking . There s no rape . So the girls calm down . I go over to a table in the room and I start cutting up a gram of coke . Now I turn around to offer the girls a line for the look of horror that is on their faces . These are 18 year old girls , they never seen cocaine . My mind is will turn around with a belt around my arm holding a needle just . So as soon as I saw their faces I tried to downplay the situation so I went . I m going to throw it away . I ve never done it before . The bad man gave it to me . I m probably horror , I m going to throw it away . So I gently scraped the coke back into my mouth . I m going to throw it away . So I gently scraped the coke back into the rap and for a man who allegedly never taken cocaine in his life I fold the rap up like an origami ninja . And then I looked at the girls and I went , well , I m off to the bathroom . And I go to the bathroom and I go to the bathroom and I start doing cocaine off the toilet seat . I come back out a little bit more , Chipper . I lay down between the girls . Every 10 minutes I m getting up and doing cocaine , I m coming back , I m still drinking whiskey after whiskey . So I m drunk plus I m coaked up and I m trying to act like I m not coaked up . And so I m trying to hide everything in front of the girls and that s given me the appearance of cerebral palsy . Because I m just lying between the girls going . And then the hot go goes to the bathroom and the big go gets in top of me and starts making out with me . And I m so wasted , I don t give a fuck I m taking all covers . </s> <s> I m like , ah , big fat person . It s like extra person . And then the hot go comes out of the bathroom and the big go gets off me and it s like nothing had happened . She makes a hell of a sound . And then the big go goes to the bathroom and the hot go starts making out with me or I start making out with her or who can remember . So when the other girl comes back from the bathroom I spring to the end of the bed and I went look , here s the deal . We ve all been making out . We should all get naked and fuck . And the big girl s already taken off at top like yeah , let s do this . And the hot go goes , I don t want to do that . So I pointed a big girl and I went , your job is to convince her . I m going to the bathroom . So I gave the bathroom , I do another fat line of Charlie . I appear at the bathroom door , the two girls are naked . I m excited but I never had a threesome before so I panic a little bit . So I jump back into the bathroom and say , my mirror , I m like , ha ha ! This is fucking brilliant ! 40 minutes ago there was going to be a rape in this room . I ve really turned things around . And then my brain goes , you re just taking a gram of coke in 40 minutes and I looked out at my cocksrible up like a walnut . And I m like , no ! And I started hitting it like it owes me money . I m trying to reason with it . Come on , it s 2018 year old . This is what we ve always talked about . I m stretching and trying to get blood flow back into it . But I ve got nothing . I don t know about you but when I take coke , I blow it out and I sweat like a beast . And I ve got fat and sweaty with this gnarly little fucking cock . My mouth s like cock and I m just looking at myself in the mirror like . . . This is you ! So it is owned and I just walk out or fat and gross like . . . How old ladies ? The big girl s going down the hot girl . The hot girl s head s at the end of the bed . So I put my flaccid cock into the hot girl s mouth , which sounds like an aggressive move . And it was . And she s sucking on this flaccid whiskey coke . And I ve got no decor . I m just over a head going . . . And my guts resting over one of her eyeballs like she was a meat pirate . </s> <s> And I was sweating profusely from my forehead into the other open eyeball . And after a minute and a half she pulls my cock out of her mouth and goes , Well , I m doing this anymore . And you know what I thought at that moment ? Good jaw . I really pushed that boat out as far into the harbor as maybe it should have gone , you know ? I was just one of the girls to go home . I wasn t going to make them happy . All I wanted at this stage of the evening was to have me coke wink . Now if you don t know what a coke wink is , you re going to have to go out and have a drink . And you re going to have to go out and have a drink . Now if you don t know what a coke wink is , let me explain . When you talk about a gram of cocaine or so and you get home and you re lying in bed and your friends are gone and the sun s about to come up and the depression s about to set in . You re masturbating for around four hours . Now this sounds excessive and it is . But don t think you re enjoying yourself for four hours . Three hours in 58 minutes , you re in fucking agony . Because the comes right at the end of your cock , but the nerve scentering of brain refuses the past message on to shoot it out . And that s what keeps you at the table like a bad gambler . Now the most important thing with a coke wink is to keep your focus . You lose your focus , you re fucked , you ve hit the reset button , you ve got to start again . I ll tell you how I do it . I lay on the bed with my laptop really high up on my chest with the battery burning into my ribcage . I put the most horrific porn I can find on the screen , which often is just women punching each other . I put my hand behind the screen so I don t have to see how violently I m fucking myself . Then through cuts , abrasions and bruises and using tears as lube , eventually you will come , but you re so dehydrated , it doesn t come out in a fluid state . You just shoot like this six gelatin chunks . Now ordinarily , when you come on your chest , it s best to get a towel and mop it up , but this stuff just rolls at a ball and chuck it in the corner . And after you realize something you didn t know before , you re almost dead . Your heart s beating at a very regular pace . Your mouth s like cotton . So you peel yourself off the mattress to get water , put your thighs are cramping up . You walk away , you turn around , you see a sweaty outline of your body on the sheet and it looks like the strut of turin . Anyway , I was looking forward to doing that . So I said to the girls , I said , you can go home and the big girl went , but I still want to get fucked and I went , ah , you re more of a package deal . </s> <s> Now as soon as I said it , as soon as I said it , I felt like a fucking asshole , right ? Well , the great thing about being an offensive comment is you can cover your steps very quickly by going , ah , I m kidding , I m crazy , wah ! So I did that , I went , oh , I d love to fuck you , I love you , I m kidding , I love it , wah ! But I can t fuck you in funny , friend . And she points at a friend and goes , you get in the bathroom while I fuck him . And I went , ah , ah ! I can t see why that wouldn t work . Now I ve got a fuck , I d be rude not to . You can t be willing to fuck someone in a couple and not be willing to fuck them as an individual . That s bad manners and my mother brought me up better than that . So I m going to fuck this girl to be polite . And a friend didn t want to go into the bathroom and she s like crying and her friend s like pushing her like , just getting the fucking bathroom . This big fat girl s pushing this hot girl like , getting the fucking bathroom . And I m so wasted , I m getting involved like , yeah , getting the bathroom . So we push this hot girl into the bathroom . She sits on the toilet , she s crying , she s so hot , she s crying like , ah ! And she turns the hairdryer on , so she doesn t have to listen . So I pitch her like , there s this hot girl , she s crying , she s holding her hairdryer , it s , ah ! Anyway , that gave me an erection . Now I ve got erection . Big question , do I wear a condom ? And the answer is no . I was on too many drugs to come , no one s getting fucking pregnant . And let s be honest , 18 year old Canadian who d never seen cocaine , let s go out in the limb and say she doesn t have AIDS . And even if she did have AIDS , it wouldn t be the aggressive , errrr , AIDS . There would be a soft , gentle girl y AIDS . It probably wouldn t kill me . So I got on top of , I thought I was a premature ejaculate , I said I didn t have to fuck her for too long . Because I knew I wasn t going to come , right ? So I put my cock in her for like 10 thrusts of it . And I just pulled out and went , ah ! And she went , always that and went , I just came over there . And she goes , no , you didn t . I went , yes , I did . It s , errr , heaps of it over there . When you go over there , you ll get pregnant . It looks like a Jackson Pollock painting over there . Anyway , then we let a friend out of the bathroom . </s> <s> The girls got dressed and they went home . Now that should be the end of the story , but it s not . That story up and five years ago . Now this year , I went back to just Philips County Festival Montreal and I wasn t supporting some movies . I was in the big theater myself . And when I finished the show , I went to the stage door and there was people waiting for my autograph . And at the end of the queue was the hot girl , all these years later . And I took her back to my hotel and I fucked her . Now the reason I tell you this story is because you should never give up on your dreams . Ladies and gentlemen , thank you so much . Come on , come on . </s>"

I mean , if Tommy is in some sort of trouble , then I d like to nip it in the barbeque . Well , quite frankly , Tommy is in trouble . Recently , his behaviour has left a great deal to be desired . Yeah . He seems to take no interest in school life whatsoever . </s> <s> He refuses to muck in on the sports field . And it s weeks since any master has received any written work from him . Yeah , me . Quite frankly , Mr . Perkins , if he wasn t dead , I d have him expelled . Speak your pardon . Yes , expelled . If I wasn t making allowances for the fact that your son is dead , he d be out on his ear . Oh , he s dead . He s lying up there in sick bay now . Stiff as a board and bright green . And this is , I fear , typical of his current attitude . Do you see the boy has no sense of moderation ? One moment he s flying around like a paper kite , and the next moment he s completely immobile . And beginning to smell or . . . How did he die ? Well , is that important ? Yes , I think so . Well , well , it s all got to do with the library . You see , we ve had a lot of trouble recently , with boys taking out library books without library cards . Your son was caught and died ministered a beating during which he died . But you ll be glad to know . . . You ll be glad to know that the ringleader was caught . So I don t think we ll be having any more trouble with library discipline . You see , the library card system . . . I m sorry . Well , you beat my son to death . Yes , yes . So it would seem . Please , I m not used to being interrupted . You see , the library card system was introduced . . . Exactly what happened ? Well , apparently boys were just slipping in the library and taking the books . No , during the beating . Oh , that ? Well , one moment he was bending over , the next moment he was lying down . I mean , er . . . Dead ish . Mr . Perkins , I find this morbid fascination of yours with your son s death . Quite disturbing . What I m talking about is his attitude . And quite frankly , I can see where he gets it from . Well , it wasn t me that beat him to death . Well , I was perfectly obvious to me from the first day he arrived here . I wondered then as I wonder now if he might not have turned out to be a very different boy indeed if you had administered a few fatal beatings earlier . Oh , you mad ? Now furious . In order to accommodate the funeral , I ve had to cancel afternoon school on Wednesday . It s a preposterous . Yes , it is . Or at least it would be if it were true . What ? I ve been joking , Mr . Perkins . But me , it s my strange academic sense of humour . I ve been pulling your leg . Oh , thank God ! </s> <s> I wouldn t cancel afternoon school to bury that little shit . And on the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee . And it came to pass that all the wine was drunk . And the mother of Jesus said unto the Lord , they have no more wine . And Jesus said unto the servants , fill six water pots with water . And they did so . And when the steward of the feast did taste of the water from the pots , it had become wine . And they knew not , whence it had come . But the servants did know , and they applauded loudly in the kitchen . And they said unto the Lord , how the hell did you do that ? And inquired of him , do you do children s parties ? And the Lord said , no . But the servants did press him , saying , go on , give us another one . And so he brought forth a carrot . And said , behold this , for it is a carrot . And all about him knew that it was so . For it was orange , with a green top . And he did place a large red cloth over the carrot , and then removed it . And lo , he held in his hand a white rabbit . And all were amazed and said , this guy is really good . He should turn professional . And they brought him on a stretcher , a man who was sick of the posi . And they cried unto him , my strobe . This man is sick of the posi . And the Lord said , if I had to spend my whole life on a stretcher , I d be pretty sick of the posi too . And they were filled with joy . And cried out , Lord , thy one liners are as good as thy tricks . Now , what indeed an all round family entertainer . And there came unto him a woman called Mary , who had seen the Lord and believed . And Jesus said unto her , put on a tutu , and lie down in this box , and then took he forth a saw and cleft her in twain . And there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth , but Jesus said , oh ye of little faith . And he threw up on the box and lo , Mary was whole . And the crowd went absolutely bananas . And Jesus and Mary took a big bow . And he said unto her , from now on , you shall be known as Sharon . For that is a good name for an assistant . And the people said , we ve never seen anything like this . This is great . You must be the son of God . But the Lord said , no , I am he who comes before . And they were sore amazed and said , then Master , how shall we know the true Lord ? And Jesus said , by his name shall ye know him . And he shall have a very religious name . And he shall be called Paul . And Daniel shall he be called . Paul Daniels they cried . And the Lord said , yes , something like that . Here ends the lesson . And now in the latest of our series , a day in the life , we present a day in the life of the invisible man . </s> <s> Every morning , I go to work by tube . Very soon , however , I get bored and decide to start annoying other passengers . I usually select the most respectable person I can find and blow gently into his left ear . Then , into his right ear , then perhaps down the back of his neck . It s about this time that the man thinks I am a draft . But not for long , because I soon stick two fingers up his nose . Higher and higher , removing them just before he sneezes . Then , I start to manipulate some other limbs . Now , I leave him alone for about ten seconds . And when he is at his most vulnerable , I kick him in the groin . And steal his seat . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Welcome back to the Olivier Theatre Awards . And we come now to the award for best actor of the year . And the nominations this year are Al Pacino for Death of a Salesman , Kenneth Branagh for Richard III . And then two actors , both from the same remarkable new play , Stench by Harold Barkworthy . And the nominees are John Daniels in the role of Mr Trotter and David Forbert in the role of Mr Gannett . Now , these are four fine actors , and I m sure they d all agree that the point is not to win , but to play the game . And the winner is . . . . . . John Daniels . No , shit . Unfortunately , John is unable to be with us tonight . And so I d like to ask his co star David Forbert to accept the award on his behalf . David . Thank you . David , how d you like to say a few words , David ? Thank you , Vanessa . Ladies and gentlemen , what I d like it to accept this award on behalf of my close personal acquaintance , John Daniels . John cannot unfortunately accept it himself because he is in Hollywood , starring in his first major film role with Meryl Streep . I am , however , not in Hollywood , not having been offered even a minor role in an eight millimeter pornographic movie . But what a delightful object it is that John has won . Although , you know , I m sure I will very soon receive one myself when I next buy ten gallons of petrol at a Texaco store . So what is it that Johnny has got that makes him stand apart from other actors of his generation ? Well , I think we all know the answer to that one . Cifalus . And what a great and heartwarming thing it is that he has already started passing it on to a whole new generation of younger actors . Of course , to win an acting award is always a great honour , but to receive one here in the heart of London s famous West End on an occasion such as this , hugely diminishes that honour . What could be more dull ? The sordid back slopping sessions where has beans and tuxedos hand over to even older has beans and tuxedos awards for plays that closed the week before they opened , because the audiences were clamoring instead for tickets to Andrew Lloyd Webber s latest rearrangement of a Vita to suit the vocal range of Kylie Manogue . </s> <s> And therefore cannot say what a delight it is that John has won this award instead of me , and I should like to announce my retirement from the acting profession in order to begin a lifetime of work amongst the mentally handicapped , in which capacity I look forward to meeting all the members of the judging panel very soon . Good evening and welcome to the Boston University Huntington Theatre for this the second part of our course in elementary courting for men . May I say how pleased I am with tonight s turnout ? Some 800 people , which is very gratifying . Tonight we look at the first date , obviously taking out a girl for the first time , is a very complex issue . The first crucial step is having arranged to pick up your date , not to look like a complete idiot when she opens the door . Best to look as though your attention has been momentarily distracted . But when you do notice , it is vital to say how pretty she is looking straight away , but don t overdo it . If at this point you are introduced to her parents , attitude is all important . You can be too casual . You can be too keen . When you have said goodbye to the parents , again don t overdo it . Leave her to your car and remember to open the door . Once in the car there are various ways of driving . If you drive like this , you might lose her respect . If you drive like this , you should have taken a taxi . Before long you will arrive at the restaurant , get out of the car , and escort her to your table . Then tuck her into her seat , yourself , and attract the waiters attention . Selecting from the wine list is important . Complete ignorance is not good . When the bottle arrives there is much to be made in the tasting of it , but don t be too professional . With eating again moderation is the order of the day . Don t eat too fast . But don t eat too slowly . Next is receiving the bill . This is a very important moment . You must be sure not to lose your cool . This is right . This is wrong . The girl may have crossed over to pay herself , in which case you should refuse . Next stop is a fashionable discotheque . Once inside you might look slightly strange if you try and talk over the music . So just stand casually and look sexy . This is good . This is better . This is starting to be misguided . After stance , dance technique is most important . Most people don t know how to dance and so do too much . Are the people do too little ? Some people dance if there is something up there bottom . And other people dance if there is something coming out of there bottom . When all said and done , it s best probably not to dance at all . The well mimed sporting injury is always useful and a good excuse for leaving the discotheque . If you don t utterly found it up , 20 minutes later you should be back at your place . It s important to relax and make your guests feel at home . </s> <s> She will probably feel as nervous as you do . And there s no need to make any extra special effort . Then putting on the music , we can t help you with the choice of CD , even though no matter what the circumstances , Donnie and Mary Osmond s greatest hits would be a mistake . At all costs , avoid the temptation to brag about your stereo . Now comes the moment you ve been waiting for . The seduction . This is the subject of next week s lecture . However , as a rough guide , this is right . And this is , I think , a degree disastrous . Good evening , gentlemen . No , no , no , no problem . Come in , please . Although , perhaps if we could just keep that delight for singing down a little bit , obviously plenty of refreshment at the football game . No , no , come in , do . . . No , no , no , that table is reserved . It is also a table for two people . Perhaps this table might be more suitable for nine . If you d like to step this way , gentlemen , please . . . Here , let me help you up . Sorry . No , no , it is a tricky bit of floor that . . . Deceptively flat and uninhabited . If you d like to take a seat , yes , or perhaps on the chair . There we are . Right , now what would anybody . . . Quiet , quiet , gentlemen , please , quiet . What would anybody like to drink ? Nine pine sharp blood . 18 pine sharp blood . 18 pine sharp blood , I m not sure if he doesn t keep it up . Now , if you d just like to take a menu , they ll just pass those round their hand one for you , sir . Dear , there we go , straight onto the floor . Here , let me pick it up for you . Undergeld , that s really what ? Try and grip it , sir . Either side , between the thumb and the four fingers , if you grip , it won t always fall on the floor . But why don t we just put it on the table ? Here , let me rest it against your friend s head . There we are . There , that should be fine . Right , now what would anybody like to eat ? Oh , it is a lamb dish , sir . A marinated lamb in coconut with a cream sauce , very nice . No , not . . . It s hot , sir . It is a . . . How can I put it ? It is a medium spiced dish . Oh , all in that case , no , in that case you want the Bombay duck . No , no , duck . </s> <s> Duck , duck , duck with the duck . Oh , I see . Oh , it was your little joke . Very funny . Well done , everybody on that one . That was very good . No , no , it is the chic cabab that is like two little turds . The shami cabab is sort of a mince onion russul . A bit like cow dung , sir , yes , but in smaller potions . Harajji , thank you if you would like to put the drinks down . Well , can we move your friend here ? Well , perhaps if we just roll him , that is a great idea . Perhaps if we just roll him out of his catalytic and into the mango chutney . Don t runny , he will be fun there . Thank you , Harajji , go katam . Now , would anybody like any writer that is a kind of a yogurt dip sort of onion cucumber ? Yes , look , I think we better wake up your friend here . Well , no , he is not just having a little nap . He is having a little nap , face down in a picture of beer . He is going to drown . Well , but oh , dear . No , no , don t worry , sir . Much better out than in . No , you worry about it , sir . What are you worried about , is he ? Just leaves all the more room for your chicken curry . Thank you very much . Indeed . So , would you like to have your friend here , might like to eat ? Hello . What would you like to eat ? A hot dog . Okay , I ll see what I can do . So , let me just go back on this piece . We want a cucumber writer , an onion writer , a paperback writer . But I m presuming that s a joke . Home eat curry , one bambi duck , four rice , four sharmic amab , and a hot dog . And anything else for starters ? Just some poppy dums and salad and yogurt and shit . Okay , I ll see what I can do . Although I m not sure you ve been needing that last item . As you all seem quite full enough of shit already . Imagine that . That s a deep one . Thank you . Oh , here comes when we cry to be full of shit , where all I m to see .

Unfortunately , it was my wedding day . And three men in particular were to blame . It all started with the priest . I now pronounce you , man and wife . Well done . You may now kiss the bride . Mm hmm . Nice one . All right , please be seated , everybody . I d just like to say a few words before communion . You know , a lot of prospective brides ask me these days . Father , what is the church s attitude to Feliccio ? LAUGHTER And I tend to reply by telling them a little story about the first time I was asked that question . LAUGHTER LAUGHTER It was a couple of years ago now . And a young attractive bride to be came up to me after a service and asked me just that question . Father , what is the church s attitude to Feliccio ? And I replied , well , you know , Joanne , I d like to tell you . </s> <s> But unfortunately , I don t know what Feliccio is . And so she showed me . And ever since , whenever anyone has asked me the question , father , what is the church s attitude to Feliccio ? I always reply , well , you know , I d like to tell you . But unfortunately , I don t know what Feliccio is . Next came my trusted best man . Right , right , right , well , right . Ladies and gentlemen , and fellow survivors of that stunning stag party , how many of those two girls get under the table and what the hell were they up to with that toothpaste ? All right , well , just before I left the house this afternoon , I said to myself , you know , the last thing you must do is forget your speech . And so sure enough , when I left the house , the last thing I did , you guessed it was to forget my speech . So it s all ad lib , I m afraid . All right , well , well , now where should I begin ? I d like to begin now . Well , well , well , well , I ve known the groom ever since we first went to school together at the age of eight . And you know , he hasn t changed the bit . Well , that s not quite true of course . He didn t have his beard then . And I tell you this , he wouldn t have been able to do whatever he was doing last night , but there s two extraordinary , extraordinary , extraordinary how little people change , isn t it ? Yeah . Although I know I ve changed a great deal , because I used to be an absolute arse . I was always blurting things out when I shouldn t have , for instance this afternoon , I m sure I wouldn t have been able to resist mentioning the bizarre sight that greeted my eyes when I opened this man s bedroom door earlier this morning . Yes , but enough of that . He started making gestures at me now , which I think means he wants me to cut my speech short . So it s a fight to say that I think he ll make a ripping husband , and I think his wife s ripping too , and I can only hope that the dress will hold out . So I d like to pose a toast to go with the pate . To the groom and to his lovely horse , her wife . It s all starting to come back to me now . And I just know that their marriage will be as happy and satisfied as I was when I paid off those two prostitutes earlier this morning . Cheers ! And finally , my loving father in law provided the perfect end to a perfect day . Ladies and gentlemen and friends of my daughter . There comes a time in every wedding reception when the man who paid for the damn thing is allowed to speak a word or two of his own . </s> <s> And I should like to take this opportunity , sloshed as I may be . To say a word or two about Martin . As far as I m concerned , my daughter could not have chosen a more delightful , charming , witty , responsible , wealthy , let s not deny it . Well placed , good looking , and fertile young man , then Martin as her husband . And I therefore ask the question , why the hell did she marry Gerald instead ? Because Gerald is a sort of man we used to describe at school as a complete prick . If I may use a gardening simile here , if his entire family may be likened to a compost heap , and I think they can . Then Gerald is the biggest weed growing out of it . I think he s the sort of man people emigrate to avoid . I remember the first time I met Gerald . I said to my wife , she s the lovely woman propping a blatter , renders old lush of a mother of his . Either this man is suffering from serious brain damage or the new vacuum cleaners arrive . As for his family , they are quite simply the most intolerable herd of steaming social animals . I ve ever had the misfortune of turning my nose up to . I spur new as I would spur an erybid dog . I would like to propose a toast to the cataracts . And to the pigeon who crapped on the groom s family s limousine at the church . As for the rest of you around this table not directly related to me , you can sod off . I wouldn t trust any of you to sit the right way on a toilet seat . Thank you . Good morning , everyone . As you may know , we were hoping to have Mr Jeremy Irons with us this morning talking to us about the art of acting in the cinema . Unfortunately , Mr Irons has had to cancel due to an unforeseen award ceremony . But I have been able to procure the services of a local actor , Mr Bernard Huppup , who was luckily not busy . So it s my pleasure now to read for Mr Huppup as he illustrates his own lecture on Shakespearean acting entitled The Actors Art . So the Actors Art by Bernard Huppup . At the centre of the Elizabethan world sits the king . Upon the character of the king depends the plot . So there are many different kinds of king . The benign king . The benign king with a physical defect . The mad king . The evil king . The evil king hatching a plot . The mad king hatching an egg . An important part was also played by messengers , distinguishable into many different types . A messenger enters bearing good news . A messenger enters bearing bad news . A messenger enters bearing bad news . A messenger enters bearing in different news . A messenger enters bearing bad news . A messenger enters bearing bad news . </s> <s> A messenger enters bearing bad news . A messenger enters bearing bad news . Oh . LAUGHTER Death came swift and often in this brutal world . Death could come at the hands of a total stranger . Or it could come at the hands of one s closest friend . Ah ! A poison was particularly popular , applied to the throttling cup of ale of the unsuspecting victim . First we look at the simple poisoning kill . BLEEER BLEEER And then the villain attempting to use poison . LAUGHTER But in the end all these were merely devices , amounting to nothing whatsoever without the plot . At the centre of the plot stands the hero who is king . He has a twin brother . Who is a villain ? With a physical defect . War comes and the hero must lead his men into battle . At the gates the hero s mistress waits to bid her lover farewell . LAUGHTER And the villain s mistress bids her lover farewell also . LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER The war rages on for many years . Until at last a messenger arrives bearing the bad news of the death of the hero . LAUGHTER So the villain becomes king . But the message was wrong . And years later the hero returns . In disguise . And revealing his identity to the audience by means of a surreptitious wink . That is brother the villain recognizes him . And they fight . Finally the villain is mortally wounded . He dies . In character . I am a battle . LAUGHTER Ah , hero wins his rightful throne . And celebrates with a frothing cup of ale found by the side of his brother s throne . Yeah ! APPLAUSE Ashes to ashes are men . We are gathered here today on this beautiful autumn morning to pay our last respects to Thomas Fairclough , Richard Mason and Harold Walker , Tom Dick and Harry . As they were known to all of us , three stout fellows of our community who will be sorely missed . Tom sadly was blind . An affliction he bore with great fortitude , especially considering he was also deaf . His only power was that of speech and song . And we all recall his enormous voice . Joining lustily in our hymn singing . Of course , being blind and deaf , Tom never actually knew what hymn we were singing . Which seemed appropriate . Because we never knew what hymn he was singing either . In fact , if we had to be frank with each other , Tom didn t actually know any hymns . Thus it is with deep gratitude we recall the day when Colonel Grant using only a sense of touch through the medium of a clenched fist . Actually broke through to Tom and got him to shut up . Needing guidance through the darkness of life , Tom was lucky to have a friend like Dick . Dick had perfect eyesight and would gladly lead Tom wherever he wanted to go . Unfortunately , since Dick was also deaf , he couldn t actually hear where Tom wanted to go . Yet like Tom , Dick never complained about his afflictions , did he ? Well , he couldn t . He was dumb . But blessed with a gift of vision , though stone deaf , he was a tremendous fan of Olivia Newton John . </s> <s> Being such an idiosyncratic pair , deaf to the world about them , Tom and Dick were to have the permanent companionship of Harry . Harry could literally hear a pin drop . Although being blind and dumb , he could not see to pick it up , or warn anyone else not to stand on it . And so as individuals , they were sadly afflicted . But together , they were in possession of all of God s senses when they . And it is together that we remember them . Together at their job , checking eggs at the battery farm . Dick would look for the cracks . Tom would complain to the foreman , and Harry would do the listening to Radio One . Likewise , in the evening , when they had returned from work , they would all sit on the big red couch . Dick watching the television . Harry listening to the television , and Tom insisting that it was time to buy a television . Sadly , as we all know , three days ago , their peaceful lives were ended . Dick saw the combine harvester . Harry heard of the combine harvester , but neither could cry out . Tom , who could have cried out , never had the faintest idea what hit him . And so they were all harvested together , blended into oneness at last . And now we trust our in heaven , as happy as any in that immortal host . For Dick will see the angels choir . Harry will hear the angels choir , and no doubt Tom will ruin it for everybody . Alright , come on , settle down . Answer your names . Ainess . Ask bandit . Bottom . Clotrus . Where are you , Clotrus ? Do do . Enema . Fist up . Come on , grow up , please . Genital . I m sorry . Herpes . Still with us , I see . I m a dick . I m a dick . Enema , you know I m a dick , don t you ? Jackulation . My prick . Has anybody seen my prick ? Come on , somebody must have seen my prick . Very well , remind me to beat my prick when he does so . Nice and quick . On top . Pube . Ah , my prick , so good of you to turn up . Yes , well now that you are here , my prick perhaps you d like to find a seat . Bottom squeeze my prick in somewhere there . Rigid . Russian exchange student , Sakuya . Tight fit . Up your sh . Volva . Your prick . And zipper . Absent . Now then boys , the headmaster has asked me to speak to you this morning on the subject of smut . All members of staff have noticed an alarming increase in the use of silly humour and pureil in New Endo about the school . I did fist up bottom out . There have been some disgusting doodling on the wards of the lavatory . Sit up straight on top . I wanted to unpleasant health magazines have been found . </s> <s> If you fall asleep on top , I shall be very annoyed . And Mr Hardon tells me that there s been a great deal of sniggering in his biology class . Tight fit . Haven t take leave your prick alone . I don t care . Your prick had no business poking the old desk in the first place . I will not put up with this kind of behaviour boys . And neither I must warn you will miss a grit big heartcock . This is a school for the sons of gentlemen . And theory is that one day you will turn into gentlemen yourselves . That is with the exception of genital , who appears to be turning into a ferret . So there will be an end to this second form toilet humour , where so much conversation is just devoted to smutty , du blown torn , du du suck me off nice and quick detention Saturday . Right , I m going to the staff room now . But if I come back and catch her peas and the corridor , like the headmaster did yesterday , then there will be trouble .

OK , none of this rhymes are hyper rolls settled here . Many of you are really great . I m going to turn off your mermaids and turn on your good comedy radar because we really have got some fabulous polymics here . Please put it together with a loud , glows geet cheer . Don t punch me in the getty for this . Mr . Shudley . One , two , three . You got me , Mr . G . T . Four . You got me , Mr . G . J . You got me , Mr . G . You got me , Mr . G . You got me , Mr . G . You got me , Mr . G . You got me , Mr . G . You got me , Mr . G . What ? What ? Play me , Mr . G . That was a . . It was him . That was his name . Dude , how can you say this ? Oh yeah ! I can t say this thing . It really was a . . Not the same as me , Mr . Shudley ! Here . So on September the 11th of 2001 , I was actually on holiday , right ? That seems distasteful now . But I wasn t to know at the time . You know , I didn t plan it . The holiday , I mean , not the attacks . And I was actually in the city of Grenada in southern Spain , right ? It s interesting place . Grenada was kind of the last point of Muslim occupation of medieval Europe . It s still a very mixed city . Lots of mosques , lots of churches , lots of Arab Spaniards and white European Spaniards . We re getting on fine . And I was walking around there on 9 1 1 . The 9th of November reclaimed the calendar . We invented those dates . It s walking around there on the 9th of November 9 1 1 . And I went into a little Spanish bar . And on television there was all this film of buildings on fire and things falling down and people running around screaming . And I said to the barman , where s that ? In Spanish , Donde Esther . And he said , Nuevo Eureka . </s> <s> And I thought , I think Colombia or somewhere , it doesn t have to be that . And then I watched for a bit longer Glasgow and I realized that it was New York where English speaking people live . And therefore a terrible newsworthy tragedy . And I don t know if you remember , do you remember the planes flying into the , yeah , World Trek ? Because we got that on the news in London . I don t know if you had it here . I don t know , mate . Any assumptions , you know . And so I was watching that in this Spanish bar . And then George Bush came on the television news . And he said , we are going to get them folks what done this . And that annoyed me for two reasons . One , because it was grammatically inaccurate . And secondly , because you could already see the terrible kind of cultural fallout of what this was going to mean . There was suddenly a horrible tension between the Aerospaniards and the White Europeans , and this previously happy bar . And after a while I couldn t stand the tension anymore . So I went into the Gents to do a wee . And a couple of people over there sniggered at the word wee . That s fine . I know this is a tense subject to open with . And I m happy that the word wee has helped diffuse the atmosphere a bit . So I stand there in this Spanish bar on the 9th and I remember doing a wee out of my car . It was yellow . And smell of a wee . And while I was doing it , this thing happened when you get a bit older where when you kind of release the pressure on the front sphincter , the back sphincter kind of loosens off of its own accord . While I was there , this Arab guy came and he stood next to me , but I didn t make eye contact with him because I was embarrassed about the wee and world news events . You know , while I was there , because I was a bit older , the front sphincter slackened off the back . Sphincter went of its own accord and suddenly a little fart came out . But it was only a really tiny fart , like the kind of fart of vol , like to or anaphril . The fart that smelled mainly of hair and was comprised principally of ideas . But it was a fart nonetheless and the Arab guy , he heard the fart and he looked across at me and I looked back at him and he laughed and then I laughed . And I realised everything was going to be okay . And then I went back into the bar , by now the situation was even worse , even more tense . The room had kind of split along racial religious lines , there was a horrible tension in the room and then suddenly Colin Powell went on the television , we invented those names . </s> <s> His name s not Colin the Barbarian . His name s Colin , he should be running a photocopier repair workshop . Colin Powell went on television on the 9th of November , Spanish bar and he said , we are going to launch a crusade against them folks what done this . And being in a largely Muslim town full of murals of crusaders cutting the heads of Muslims , you realise what an inappropriate word crusade was to use on the 9th of November , it went down really badly and as a world statesman Colin Powell should be aware of how words change their meaning kind of culturally saying crusade on the 9th of November , it s a bit like if I were to get a job as a maths teacher , teaching maths in a German town somewhere near Belson . And I was to say to the kids , I m going to set you a maths problem , I want you to work through it and on the last page fill in your final solution . You know I ll be received badly and as a world leader Colin Powell should be aware of these kind of cultural shifts in language but he said crusade and it went down really badly and there was something that was even worse at the atmosphere than before and then the Arab guy that had my kind of moment of epiphany of kind of human trust within the toilets he was sitting just in front of me and he looked across at me with these eyes full of hope as if to go what are we going to do ? And I didn t know what to do , I mean I couldn t just do another far outweigh . You know I m not a 19th century French musical entertainer . I m the opposite of that . And for main ways there isn t time to go into now . But someone went oh disappointed there if you seek me out afterwards I ll clarify the exact position . But I knew I had to do something so it was my moment so what I did was I just kind of lifted my leg up like that and I sort of acted it out and I went oh fuck smell , oh and he laughed and the guys he was with laughed . Gradually the laugh to spread all around the room . There was a critic from the independent on Sunday at the back not laughing . He didn t really get what I was doing you know I was kind of mixture of the sacred and the profanities when I was head but eventually everyone in the room was laughing and I realized that with that one in name pure old scatological gesture I had achieved more for world peace than any politician had all day . Because Farts are funny Glasgow right that is the international baseline of all humour Farts right and you can be as sophisticated as you like Glasgow but at the end of the day you have to admit Farts are funny and you go no we don t actually agree with you Stu I saw a hilarious satirical cartoon in the new statesman at the weekend satirising EU farming policies it was hilarious was it was it as funny as a fart no it wasn t but actually I saw Ian his slop on television at the weekends too satirising the government with his voice going up with the start of a sentence and then down at the end it was hilarious was it was it as funny as some gas that smells of shit coming out of an ass no it wasn t and nothing Ian his slop ever says or does or secretly imagines will be as funny as that and around this show in Edinburgh French festival right in August and every year in Edinburgh they have a prize for comedy right organised by peri a the peri a awards peri a of course owned by Nestle Nestle top of the world health organisation list of unethical companies it s suggested that their milk marketing policies contribute to the death of 1 . </s> <s> 5 million children every year so every time you laugh at a peri a nominated act a little baby dies and every year in Edinburgh they always give that award to comedy to a human being speaking about some stuff if they had any integrity they would give the peri a award to the genuinely funniest thing that s going to happen in Burrall August which is just going to be an old Scottish tramp doing a fart in a wood but Glasgow if a tramp farts in a forest and no one hears it is it still funny yes it is because it s some gas that smells of shit coming out of an ass but if the peri a had any integrity which they don t they would give that peri a award to comedy to a fart and if Channel 4 had any integrity which they don t they would sign up that fart for its own 12 part Channel 4 comedy series deal some laughs some doubt in the ring people going we re kind of with you theoretically we understand this is some kind of satire of something but how would that actually works to you an invisible cloud of shit smelling gas with its own Channel 4 series I don t know Glasgow I don t know what I say to you is could an invisible cloud of shit smelling gas with its own Channel 4 series be any less funny than the Friday night project so the day after the 9th of November which is the 9th of December 912 do the math I flew back from Spain to Heathrow Airport I got a mini cab from Heathrow Airport to Stonk New Inter and Hackney North East London where I live and on the way I had to go past the Finnsbury Park mosque which you ll know if you read the news is the kind of hotbed of Muslim radicalism in Britain run by Abu Hamza until recently that s the guy who has an eye patch and hooks for hands an eye patch and hooks for hands that s not a good look for religious leader it s a good look maybe for considering auditioning for extra work in the sequel to pirates of the Caribbean but it s not a good look for religious leader the Archbishop of Canterbury does not have an eye patch and hooks for his hands he has a big festive Christmas beer and which robins my nest and that helps us to take his pronouncements on the ethics of the family and modern society more sympathetically than we would if he had hooks for his hands you d be suspicious no woman they re saying it s only one hook I think that it s hooks for handling he s got two but of course luckily the element of doubt has been introduced here I m able to go away and check that if it s fact in accurate I can remove it from this video as I can everything you ve said so I ll just look like a 60 minute stream of uninterrupted success although ironically I may consider leaving this part in to give the illusion of it being a genuine event what do you think of that viewers at home this is simultaneously dishonest and yet also satisfying but Abu Hamza of course he s in Belmarsha at the moment he s in the process of being deported to America where he is guaranteed a fair trial irony there one of the many comic tools we ll be using tonight so I was driving past the Finnsbury Park mosque on the night of December the day after the night of November and it was all kicking off outside there s Muslim demonstrators on one side of the street complaining about the reprisals they suffered police in the middle trying to keep order and on the other side of the Seven Sisters Road British National Party members standing near the Arsenal shop their spiritual home and they re shouting out send them back send the Muslims back to where they came from Bradford wood green leads Liverpool Manchester Birmingham another British industrial city which required cheap labour in the 1960s and 70s and it looked Glasgow like there was going to be a full scale religious race riot and so I said to the minicab driver stop let me out I can help you and I got out of the minicab I pushed through the British National Party bloke I pushed through the police line I pushed through the Muslim demonstrators I ran into the mosque some guy tried to get me to take my shoes I ve done this about there wasn t time I carried on through it was a nice hospital gesture but it was ill time and I ran up the prayer tower to the minaret where the call to prayer is broadcast out to the faithful of North London and I snatched a little microphone out of the stand there and I pulled down my underpants and I shoved it up my anus and with a concerted effort of mental and physical willpower I farted into it but on that occasion it didn t really help in fact some eyewitnesses to the ensuing carnage were subsequently to suggest that it may have made the situation worse and my heart felt message of peace and goodwill to all men was misunderstood although I take some comfort in the fact that a similar thing often happens to Jesus not saying I am Jesus that s for you to think about at home but if I was him this is the kind of place I would come isn t it a simple humble place let s go empire I would come in but I m not saying I am Jesus not in the current climate well I think there s a kind of European kind of smudness where we look at America s kind of hysterical overreaction to the events of the 9th of November and we go thanks for that America thanks you ve set us off on a course the destruction of world civilization as we know it thanks for that thanks but you mustn t hate the Americans right America is currently the most hated country in the world Americans don t know that they don t read or watch news if they did they would be unhappy the summer bin Laden flew planes into the world trade center it was a waste of time if he really wanted to hit America hard where it hurts he should a carpet bomb the country with a weapon that Americans would never be able to understand world geography examination papers you shops which don t have the word barn in their name and the metaphysical concept of shame but you mustn t hate the Americans don t hate them glad to go Americans live in a kind of state of ignorant pre lapse Aryan bliss they don t know what s going on and because of that it can be very relaxing to go to America and watch them if you go to America and you look at Americans in their natural habitat the theme park the shopping mall the race right at the high school massacre you watch them walking around looking at colors and shapes and light words sometimes imagining what the words might mean it s very relaxing because it s like watching carp in a pond in a stately home their mouths opening and closing it s charm you mustn t hate the Americans they re not a naturally curious people most Americans do not own passports they re not a naturally curious people if you were to lock an American for 60 years in an empty underground bunker which contain nothing except a woolly T . </s> <s> Cozy that American would not even be curious enough to be tempted to see if the T . Cozy would make a serviceable hat the farmer likely to arrest the T . Cozy and turn it illegally in Wantanamo Bay and then repeatedly aimally rape it until such time as it admits that it was actually a member of an alcoida training cell even though at the time of the alleged defence the T . Cozy was actually working as a shop assistant in a branch of curries in Wolverhampton some laughs they re other people a bit confused what s he talking about right okay well again that s a kind of bit of satire of the fact that some of the British citizens held in Wantanamo Bay were tortured into saying that they d been in alcoida camps even though at the time they were supposed to be there they were actually working as shop assistants in a branch of curries in Wolverhampton other people are sent to going yeah we know about that that s not what s confusing us what s confusing us here in Glasgow is the idea of a T . Cozy working as a shop assistant in a branch of curries how could that possibly work and again Glasgow I say to you I don t know I don t know how that would work but what I say to you is could a T . Cozy working as a shop assistant in a branch of curries actually be any less effective some of the people currently employed there hello I don t know if you can help me I m interested in buying one of those iPods I m sorry sir I won t be able to help you on account of the fact that I am fashioned entirely from colourful world perhaps you d like to ask one of my colleagues the cardigan the mitten the balaclava helmet and again you ll notice there are a list of three things really they ought immediately to build but the balaclava helmet was a disappointment it didn t get the lawful be hoping for there and I knew that was going to happen right because like I say around this show in in Edinburgh for a month lost August and I thought I ll be honest with you Glasgow I thought the balaclava helmet was going to get a big laugh ironically I ve been touring this the only place the balaclava helmet did get a big laugh was in older shop which is a military town so they probably have a different kind of business with it but on the whole people don t find it funny and I was confused because for me the balaclava helmet is one of those inherently absurd items I thought it would be a good top of there but it never works so the first kind of week of the run the month run I kept swapping the order around I was going perhaps you d like to talk to one of my colleagues the balaclava helmet mitten cardigan cardigan balaclava helmet mitten whatever and after wait still nothing we ve never got any laughs then after about 10 days one of my friends in the audience the actor Kevin Elden who you may remember from channel 4 is packing him in in the early 90s his best work he did and I said to him why do you think that isn t working and he said well the problem is all the items in your list are made of wool and the tea cozy has already said to the customer that it won t be able to help him on account of the fact that it is made from wool so for the tea cozy to suggest to the customer that he seeks assistance from other exclusively woolen items you know it simply adds insult to injury it makes the situation worse I said yeah I never thought of that you know what shall I do and he said well just think of three things that aren t made of wool and you ll be all right I thought yeah I will but I won t write them down you know I ll come out every night and I ll just make them up I ll exist in the moment I ll trust it the chance I ll improvise like Eddie Isard pretends to do no and when you try to do it you realise why he doesn t it s hard it s hard to do it s much easier to just go er in every sentence and give the illusion of spontaneity so I came out let it go let it go so I came out the first night I went yeah perhaps you d like to talk to one of my colleagues and I said you know the stick the wood and then I said the toaster and again there was no laughs I thought it wasn t I went home I thought yes because the problem is the toaster is an electrical item and the people are thinking is that working in curries or is it for sale yeah but I was chasing the problem down basically I realised I needed three things that were neither electrical nor woolen right but it s quite hard to think of that so I think of a thing weather vain weather vain the act of coming wangus weather vain the act of cunny lingus and banana what a banana a banana weather vain the act of cunny lingus some of well admittedly those are those are quite good then electrical nor well and weather vain banana good the act of cunny lingus is particularly good because that takes us into an area where concepts are working in a show it s going to certainly I was in Aspen Colorado two weeks ago in America you beat them hands down the American audience their first two suggestions were a scarf and a kettle and electrical straight although to be fair this wasn t the part of the set they like least you know after the 9 1 1 opening a lot of the American audience have been shaken off in Aspen and if anything arguably the New York warm ups were worse well this week is about two weeks into heading with some kid emailed me and he went um you know that bit you do about people being so bored they wear t cows as his hat so when yeah he goes um there s a spike milligan aura billy connolly joke like that he said from 1972 so basically I must have kind of remembered down and copied it so that bit the first half of it is plagiarised and the second half doesn t really work but I was making a number of kind of crass generalisations about Americans that I don t really believe anything and I did it for comic effects and I don t understand how anyone can have a kind of generalised view about another nation or race I certainly don t and I think it s because I m different to a lot of you I m not necessarily better by am I different and I m better let s face it but I think it s because I feel a little bit kind of removed from your human society because I m actually I m adopted I m an adopted man and so I m suspicious of notions of identity or nation and for example I grew up thinking that I was English right but about two years ago I found out and this is true I found out that my real father is Scottish right which of course means that I m Scottish because as you ll know Scottishness is passed on through the male genes but disability and it overwhelms all female chromosomes and that s why there are no Scottish women and there s no Scottish women . </s> <s> None of it there are men in kilt but that s just nature trying to find its own level and if a Scottish man wants to breed of course you have to travel south of the board and normally you get as far as a major English railway station get off the train lie down in a gutted drunk and hope some pollen lands on you and and I can say that remember because I technically I am Scottish . Yes , Scottish , genetically if not culturally but I think that even though I grew up thinking I was English I think I was new that I was one of you you know because I d go into school Monday mornings and people would go did you see the sport at the weekends to the brilliant sport that all men must like with England s winning in it it was good wasn t it and I go no in fact it filled me with feelings of revulsion and disgust . Then they go to me what about the rich tapestry the tablo of English culture and history do you take no pleasure in that and I go no fact a whole notion of English culture just makes me feel kind of mentally physically and spiritually bereft and they go what about the English language a tongue of Shakespeare Shelley Blake Churchill does that not stir some residual national pride in you and I go no in fact whenever I hear an English accent I have to be physically sick and I would hear my own voice answering their question I would start vomiting as I spoke so I hate as a child I hated being English and yet conversely I always harbored secret cravings for shortbread awful and heroin you know deep fried heroin if I could get it with sauce heroin supper 295 but so I think I always knew glass go hardly believe this is happening I got always knew but I was a scotch man and I say always new and but yeah a Scottish thank you for correcting me sorry you know it was an error I made on purpose for comic effects and I m glad that there s so little trust in me in the room that people are going he s a fucking idiot doesn t know he s insane what s he talking about he hasn t done the most basic research but no but no even despite that I always knew that I was scotch in my heart in my brave heart I always knew that I was okay shout out if you ve seen the film brave heart you ve all seen it shout out okay now you ll know more than any other audience I ve played in the last three weeks that brave heart is the shitest film ever made right it was it was directed by the reactionary Catholic Big Up Mel Gibson and it s full of basic fundamental historical errors which insult your race and mind by association right here s here s just three I ve toughened my head firstly William Wallace Braveheart your national hero he wasn t some you know noble savage living in a mud hut we all know they was a privileged educated no woman right secondly it s not mentioned by Mel Gibson in the film but there s some evidence to suggest that he actually for as a mercenary for the English as a teenager that s conveniently missed out thirdly you know that French princess he s supposed to have sex with this French princess in the film you remember and the implication is that he gets her pregnant and she marries Edward II of England sites his kid now she was a real historical figure that French princess but at the time of the death of William Wallace Braveheart your national hero she was only four years old now glass gone not saying but William Wallace Braveheart your national hero didn t have sex with her you know he probably did if I look at my own personal background there s a lot of sexual opportunism involved in it but not saying he didn t have so he probably did but if he did and he did he definitely did right right it would have been a far less romantic scene than the one enacted by Mel Gibson in the film Braveheart it may have happened in a tent but it would still have been not a romantic scene because that would have made William Wallace Braveheart your national hero a pedophile a Scottish pedophile the worst kind of pedophile there is coming at you through a boughy shortbread on its face muttering unintelligible sexual threats in a frankly incomprehensible dialect but another weird thing about that film is you know in it like um fine leave at this point uh it gets it gets worse the man leaving there to go away and think about the idea of a pedophile Braveheart the privacy of the toilet cubicle but it s not the way the other weird thing about that film is that in it remember like uh Mel Gibson makes a big deal about the fact that Edward the second of print English Prince was gay right as if not only did he oppress the scots but he did it in a kind of a gay way which makes it worse but the iron years again it s not mentioned in the film that William Wallace Braveheart your national hero himself was actually gay and no he was a sir and we know this from some information it s come to light in the last couple of years firstly about two years ago they found a cache of love letters hidden in a nook at uh at uh Glam s castle or somewhere and the letters were exchanged between William Wallace and Robert the Bruce and they were full of declarations they were full of declarations of love and details of their of their section encounters we can very vigorous section encounters that they had that s one thing they re about a year ago they found some graffiti on uh a wall on an old Scottish wall on the wall the wall on the wall of a broch actually which is the brock of Garnet which is a real place in the Ortonis they found it there and it said um the graffiti which is real they existed it said uh I am a gay signed William Wallace Braveheart and the Braveheart bit was in inverted commas so they knew that meant it was real it s like a fun nit name you know it s like real so so uh William Wallace Braveheart our national hero was gay and you know when I was talking this in Edinburgh some people were going why didn t we know about that you know why and the reason is because the graffiti and the letters were written in gaylic so it wasn t translated and people were going well why wasn t it translated that s just the ancient language of our nation of the scots why wasn t it translated but it wasn t what gaylic actually was was a very kind of highly evolved form of medieval Scottish homosexual pat watch and the clues in the name if you look at it right gay lick that means gay homosexual gay and then lick is language or tongue so gay lick literally the language of gays and you know I was booed off at the assembly rooms for saying this in Edinburgh but it s true and I don t think it s a I think it s really great that the national hero uh William Wallace was gay because Scotland s always been a much more progressive liberally minded and kind of a nation that s not afraid to show its feminine side and I think that compared to England which is very backward kind of bigger to place and I think that it s really good as we enter 21st century one of your national folk heroes can embody a kind of progressive notion of sexual identity I think that s a really brilliant thing and I wish that some of the English folk heroes like King Alfred or Robin Hood or King Arthur had been gay but but they weren t and it s only William Wallace great for the Scottish one that definitely was gay and of course another sorry someone said Robin Hood was surely and they re saying men in tights but of course the men in tights addition to the Robin Hood legend was made in the 1980s by Mel Brooks the uh facility to make those kind of tights didn t exist in medieval England if it had had done maybe they would have warned them I m sure that a thin derniate tight is uh an ideal garment for medieval combat offering as it does no protection whatsoever to the human leg of course the other major in accuracy about that film of course in the middle ages there was no such country as Scotland Scotland was actually invented as you all know in 1911 by the McGowan s sweet company as a way of marketing highland softly because of course traditionally we think Toffees better if it s manufactured at a high altitude again I was making a number of kind of crash generalizations about about the scots about my country down I don t I don t believe any of them again I did it for common effect but you do meet people who have very fixed notions about other groups of people I give an example of what I mean I got in a cab in London in December and about five minutes into the journey apropos of nothing early on a Sunday morning the cab driver turned around to me and he said I think all homosexuals should be killed now whatever you think of that Glasgow as a statement you have to admit it s a bold opening conversation you know we re the stranger and I was a bit taken back I went to my wife you think that and then there was a pause because he d obviously never had to go to the next level of the argument for fraternising mainly with cab drivers so well that was just accepted at the point so and he said well after mommy said well because homosexuality is immoral and I said this is honestly true I said I m not sure how much weight you can afford to place on the notion of morality in this argument because morality is not a fixed thing it changes its parameters culturally historically over time I said for example look at ancient Greece to this day we still take most of our most fundamental principles about ethics aesthetics philosophy medicine science whatever from ancient Greece and yet I said in ancient Greece love between two men far from being immoral was actually considered the highest most ethical most profound if you will most moral form of love that there could be so all I m saying I said to him is I m not sure how useful morality is given its flexible nature as a cornerstone of your argument on this subject and then he said to me this is honestly true he said well you can prove anything with facts can t you from it I went yeah and I thought hang on that s the most fantastic way of winning an argument I ve ever heard you can I m not interested in facts I finally tend to cloud my judgment I prefer to rely on instincts and blind prejudice and I came of age for one of a better phrase in the 1980s when we had political correctness and people look back at that and they go oh political correctness was shit wasn t it being fair to people and I think maybe it s good because people wouldn t have said that and you wouldn t have had happened what happened in May last year right if you remember Ron Atkinson the football manager he got in trouble for calling a black footballer a lazy thick nigger right and loads of people complained about it understandably and then on May the 17th Jimmy Hill the BBC employed football commentator came out in Ron Atkinson s defence and he said then his opinion it was a load of fuss about nothing he said what you have to understand Jimmy Hill said in a paper something to me is that in the culture of football calling a black man a nigger is just a bit of harmless fun and I thought call me old fashioned I know the culture of football has a very broad definition of harmless fun broad enough to include carrying out a racial assault and still getting in the England team gang raping a teen edge girl in a London hotel room and yet perversely allowing Jimmy Hill to carry on living but surely that can t be the case but Jimmy Hill went on to qualify his statement he said that in his opinion calling a black man a nigger was no more offensive than calling him Jimmy Hill chiny because he had a big chin and again I read them I thought call me a square from the past but surely the word nigger is more offensive than the word chiny because the word nigger comes with a whole weight of cultural and historical significance that it s not really there for the word chiny you know there were not some there are not people in this country studying for election now on the grounds that people with big chin should be sent back to wherever they came from chinland probably I m done he was searching to be obviously there were not vast sways of humanity historically enslaved on the grounds that they had big chin if there had been all popular culture as we know it would be entirely different there would not be a blues route underpinning all the late 20th century popular music that you love if the Mississippi Delta had been populated exclusively by disenfranchised ex layers with big chin woke up this morning got a big chin it s not that much of a problem to be honest I won t base an entire musical genre on it and you don t hear news reports saying a man was beaten to death in whole last night the violence is thought to have been chin motivated although in Jimmy Hills case I ll be happy to see an exception made kill him kill Jimmy Hill but kill him in an ironic way break in to the natural history museum steal the jawbone of a blue whale the largest chin currently known to science and beat Jimmy Hill to death with it in an example of what sociologists are already calling chin on chin violence but we shouldn t be surprised glass guy to find out that Jimmy Hill is evil and mad right because all people that are involved in the business of football or play football or going to support it or watch it on television or even know anything about it a filthy reactionary scum take Gary Linnaker for example right Gary Linnaker is a twisted evil man you re going no he isn t stew he s nice he s like a velvet owl he isn t Gary Linnaker is evil Gary Linnaker chooses to advertise crisps right and with the benefit of early 21st century superscience we now know that crisps rather than being a life giving health food as we could make little children fat and then they die now about six years ago due to a tragic chain of events I didn t live anywhere for about four months I had to sleep on the floor of an office in West London and I ate mainly couldn t cook anything so I ate mainly crisps from the garage and during that period I put on about four stones and someone said to me do you know no that a single packet of crisps contains your full daily allowance saturated fat when I just thought that represented good value it was Gary Linnaker looking out because I trusted his velvet owl face to look after me and but he chooses to advertise crisps why does Gary Linnaker advertise crisps he can t need the money he s on television all the time isn t he amusing us his family run a fresh fruit and vegetable stand in less the market Linnaker s fresh fruit and veg he could advertise that he could help to save human lives but instead he chooses to advertise crisps why does Gary Linnaker advertise crisps it can only be that Gary Linnaker is sexually aroused by the idea of obese children dying now there s one person clapping over there of course remember for a comedian the only thing the no one clapping is the sound of one person clapping is it suggests you re out on a kind of a limb let s try and find out more about people like football I went on your internet on your worldwide web and I went on Jimmy Hill s website which is real it s called Jimmy Hill dot co UK and there s a a guest book there where you the public that s you can leave your opinions and a bloke called Scott have been on it and I m not allowed to read out what is actually email addresses but if you go there you could find it so you know do that anyway he said Scott says in the guest book of Jimmy Hill s website he says I agree with Jimmy s views that Britain is rapidly becoming no more a land which is populated by genuine British people born here please don t get me wrong right to Scott I am no Nazi or xenophobes as the pressure groups or government would have you believe I m just someone who was born in this country and hates to see it going to pot now and it will be easy to take Scott s views seriously if he hadn t spelled the word xenophob ZENATH OB which of course just means someone who has an irrational hatred of Japanese Buddhism but it is easy Glasgow right and the current climate of paranoids may kind of race based era right I ve done it myself I ll tell you how it happened I haven t been doing this for a few years and one of the jobs I ve been doing was working as a kind of arts journalist writing about stuff and last year I was really excited because I got to interview Ang Lee the Taiwanese film director about the incredible Hulk film they directed and I was really excited because I ve read the incredible Hulk comics since I was about six years old and I still read them now and I will take to prove that I will take any question on the Hulk from you now I ll prove that anything what color is he ? </s> <s> Have you asked me that because you know that s there s a more complicated answer than you no okay well bad luck because he was he wanted me to say he was green and everyone to go aha that s funny but actually for the first six issues of a sounding story is in 96 years a man nodding there with a t shirt saying kill everyone now on it kind of person who knows these facts for the first six issues he was of course great of course but because of the dot printing thing the colors all used to run together so it kind of blur so they made him green after the six issue and he s been green twice since then once in a six issue mini series written by Jeff Lowe and Tim Sail called Hulk great it s gray and that came out last year the full last available and hard back now and he was also gray in the comic strip between about 1989 and 94 when Peter David was writing it and he made him go in a nutrient bath and that made him great I ve lost you now as well I ve beaten you I ve beaten you with your kill everyone no you don t claim to be an expert he looked at me with a doubtful face as if this is going to get him but look I know more about the Hulk than you and I m older than you so that s fine so I was really excited to interview Ang Lee about the Hulk and because he made the film but I try to make a little joke to put them at ease you know so I rang him up he was in New York I was in London and I said to him Ang Lee you have directed the Hulk film you must be very excited and proud but don t make me Ang Lee you wouldn t like me when I m Ang Lee then there was a long embarrassed pause and then Ang Lee said I m sorry what did you say and I said I said Ang Lee you have you ve directed the Hulk film you must be very excited and proud but don t make me Ang Lee you wouldn t like me when I m Ang Lee and there was another kind of silence and then Ang Lee said I m sorry can you repeat that and I said there s no need it was just a stupid joke and he went no what did you say and I said I said Ang Lee you ve directed the Hulk film you must be very excited and proud but you don t make me Ang Lee you wouldn t like me when I m Ang Lee I didn t say anything but I said I expect loads of people have made that joke to you and he said no no one s ever said it before why did you say it why and I said well Ang you know the Hulk film and he went yeah I said well in that Bruce Banner he s the Hulk he says don t make me angry you wouldn t like me one I m angry and your name s Ang Lee and you directed it so I said don t make me Ang Lee you wouldn t like me when I m Ang Lee because Ang Lee sounds a bit like Ang Lee and Ang Lee said no it doesn t and I said come on Ang he fair Ang Lee does sound a bit like Ang Lee and Ang Lee said no it doesn t Ang Lee is a completely different word to Ang Lee and I said I m sorry can you repeat that and Ang Lee said yes Ang Lee is a completely different word to Ang Lee and I said I don t understand what point you re trying to make what I m saying if you listen is that Ang Lee sounds a bit like Ang Lee so if you swap them round people can see there s a slight change there s some sort of joke there Ang Lee what you re saying is actually the same word as Ang Lee if you swap those two words round no I would notice the difference it wouldn t work but that s not what you re what you appear to be saying is that Ang Lee is a completely different word to Ang Lee but it isn t there the same thing and I can t understand it s very simple the joke but make I can t understand that you ve got into this kind of fix and then he went oh I get it he said is this a joke about me having a Taiwanese accent and I was more if I went no it never even occurred to me that you would think that s just a simple thing about the words the syllables reanly sound of the same my own surname is Lee I ve had 36 years of fun with that syllable I know what I m talking about I can t see why you would begin to think and he went no your anti Taiwanese and I went I m not I don t even know where Taiwan is I ve got no interest in it I made it worse to be honest then he got he got you are then he got like a lawyer on from Universal and I had to shout in at me so I was like I had to get my editor on from the paper to stick up for me when I have this kind of four way argument when I m fragile he s going to anti Taiwanese he was saying my editor s going no he isn t there s no history of anti Taiwanese and it s all and there s like this thing and on Ang Lee started shouting out in the about it and I went why can t see what your problem is why don t you just listen to the joke it s obvious then he went don t make me ang Lee you wouldn t like me when I m angry and I said you ve proved my point you fucking Taiwanese idiot he said don t call me that he got another bloke on and advisor I had to get someone else on to publish this like a six way two hour debacle and the end we argued for so long that Ang Lee missed his 230 dentist appointment that s the time that he goes to the dentist class go don t let him tell you any different he doesn t even need to write it down they offer him an appointment card he rejects it he says I ll remember it by thinking about my own pain I m going to shout out some questions now I need you to answer loudly to them the answer most of is yes okay one two three who likes alcohol yeah powder who likes sweets yeah all right scream cakes likes their favorite food whatever it is who likes Ben Elton it s no one okay here s another one who likes who likes the Simpsons yeah he likes Spider Man who likes their favorite fictional character from their own childhood who likes their own beloved mother who likes Ben Elton I know one again okay he s no one who likes snowflakes who likes sunshine who likes the universal concept of eternal peace and happiness who likes the summer bin Laden yeah who likes Ben Elton I know one again it s fucking what is weird that is wicks I must have done that 30 or 40 times right and every time without any element of manipulation more people like a summer bin Laden multiple merger than Ben Elton I think why more people like a summer bin Laden Ben Elton I think it s because when you compare the two of them compared to Ben Elton a summer bin Laden has at least lived his life to a consistent set of ethical principles just yeah clap let him hear you so uh because people hate Ben Elton every now and again a journalist has the courage to ask him why this is I ve seen it happen twice in print and once on parking some parking sets of him he said to Ben Elton Ben Elton why do you think everyone hates you and Ben Elton said he did and Ben Elton said well Michael it s because in this country people don t like success but he was wrong about that they realised he was much more simple it s just that in this country people don t like Ben Elton and they don t hate him through the kind of conduit of the notion of success they hate him entirely on his own terms because of who he is and the bad things that he s done and I think if you my age you can kind of understand why it is because if you re if you re over 35 you ll remember before alternative comedy when you d watch comedians and it had no kind of relevance to you don t understand what they were talking about or who they were and then the young ones came along and all that with Ben Elton and he thought oh at last something for us then of course over the years Ben Elton s changed he worked with Queen who were one of the British bands that broke the cultural embargo on South Africa under a part side he s worked with Andrew Lloyd Weber who s worse than that and a song that they co wrote was performed at the inauguration of George Bush and when questioned about it Ben Elton said he didn t see it so much as a celebration of George Bush as a celebration of the President of the United States of America but of course they re the same thing that s why that argument doesn t work but the problem is he s been kind of compromised by a proximity to success and if you think about it all the great comedians are kind of outsider figures commenting on society from outside kind of holy fools shaman clowns outsiders spike Milligan was able to remain an outsider by virtue of having long term mental illness problems Bill Hicks has been able to remain an outsider because he died of cancer Michael Barrymore has been able to remain an outsider by becoming the subject of a murder investigation after a man was found dead in his pool and I admire Barrymore s commitment to this abstract notion of the outsider shaman clown figure and I think it s good that he s setting his great to be this late at night in Glasgow talking about this idea but lately I have more sympathy for what we re in the trade call Elton s compromise because in the last few years I directed a show and it was going to hit in the West End and I had to meet loads of famous people on press nights and opening nights I met Bonnie Langford yeah I met her twice I met the tall one from the three degrees Sheila something her name is and one night I found myself shaking hands before I was to it was with Michael Portillo right I looked up I thought it was the little wooden goblin from the coupon on I feel but it was Michael Portillo as someone whose policies I had marched against as a student or would have done if I hadn t been drunk with theoretically I was there was worse to come them Portillo on June 16th last year I heard a rumor that Sherry Blair was going to come and see the show right and I thought well I hope that s not the case you know I don t want to have to me hurt because I m I want a two million Britain s that marched against our husbands war I think it s unethical it s going to come back and buy us in the ass and we ll be in trouble about it for decades once the dust settles like I don t want to have to be like some elis celebrity new labor apologies so I don t want to meet no way and then the next day the woman from the public relations company for the show rang the up she said I ve got some great news Sherry Blair is coming to see the show and she wants to meet the cast and the creative team afterwards and I m sorry I can t do it I ve got this is where I draw a line you know you I said you don t even want me in the building if I m there I m going to get kind of political Tourette syndrome and just do something like fly an anti war banner off the stage or make a speech at the end or just do something to Sherry Blair that ll wipe that whatever that is on her face you know make it go and she said well that s a shame because that does this change your mind she said she s not coming on her own she s coming with her guest who is the president of scope the spastic society right and this honestly happens putting this weird position where you want to make some ineffectual gesture against Sherry Blair you don t want to snub a person from a worthwhile charity you know so I thought well I know what I ll do I ll go down and after the show I ll say to Sherry Blair I hope you re happy Sherry I hope when you look across at Tony every morning you think of all those thousands of people killed in his war and I hope you re happy when you think for those little kids and Baghdad and Basra with their arms and legs blown off maimed crippled for life then I ll turn to the woman from scope and I ll go maybe you can have a rummage round in one of your charity shops if you can find them some cardigans being the end I didn t do that what I did was I said I would go I just didn t yeah but we re back talking about the war again last last bit and like I say there s this kind of assumption I think from us here in Europe where we look at particularly in Britain where we look at America s hysterical reaction to the ninth of November and we think well you know that wouldn t happen here we wouldn t do that because we re a reason of all sensible people in Britain but we don t have to look very far back in our own cultural history to see an example of us losing the floor as a nation I m talking of course about the death of Princess Diana the late Princess of Wales it was in the news again last summer because of the Princess Diana memorial fountain which you ll remember was a rubbish fountain fulfilled very few of the job description criteria I ll fountain but it s ongoing so I ll never go as away I remember when she died because about two days before the state funeral I went down to Kensington Palace where Princess Diana had lived to to look at all the tributes left outside you know and in amongst all the bunches of flowers and sympathy cards and poems little kids had written and drawings and paintings people had done whatever in amongst all that I honestly saw and this is true I saw a life size inflatable model of ET was honestly there outside Kensington Palace two days before the state funeral and I stood there looking at the inflatable ET for some 40 or 50 minutes and I thought to myself how did that get there who would have thought that that was an appropriate gesture and I imagined a household somewhere on that awful autumn Sunday morning where perhaps a wife had worked not first and she d watched the news and she went through to us still sleeping husband and she said please please wake up I need you to wake up and be with me now there s been some terrible news I need you to get up come in the front room and watch it on attention with me because I can t be alone so please wake up you know he s at ease asleep he s asleep he s going what is fucking it is half past six on a Sunday morning I am asleep I know I m speaking by I am asleep I don t want to get up I m asleep so just I know you re upset but just say what it is what is it and she d have gone please if you if you love me just this one time just get up and because it s an awful thing and I need I can t be alone I need someone to comfort me and share just please go I need a gone look I was out late last night I ve got I ve got a work at seven tomorrow I don t this is my this is my one day for sleeping in I don t want to get up to about half past eleven to be honest and even then I m not going to get dressed I m just going to be like in my pants and stuff I kind of if I don t know what you if you were to just say what it is you know what you know what is it she d have gone princess Diana lady die as she has been killed I need a gone no not the queen of hearts so the rose of England Scotland Wales and bits of Ireland no how did it there s no god how did it why how did it happen she d have gone was in a car crash in Paris last night they don t know the exact details yet but she s dead so for symbol at that point he d have got up go out of bed try to get dressed you know and get some kind of grip on his emotions and his feelings calm down his grief and then he d have said I d better go out and get a life size inflated model you know for the gates of our home and his wife would have said yes but you d better hurry because there ll be a rush on those we don t want to be the only people not for you one minute but I was talking like this on stage in Croydon at the time it happened and a bloke shouted out I was there and I saw that and it wasn t a life size inflatable model of ET it was a life size inflatable model of Alph I didn t even know one Alph was out to asking he said oh it s an American kids TV thing 8 and alien ALF alien life form it s like a cross between a pig and an adva from space but it s sometimes wears a nappy and it says kind of wise ass things and he said he d seen one of those there I didn t see an Alph outside Kensington Paris before and I m not saying there wasn t one there maybe there was at some stage but by the time I arrived it got covered up under flowers or carried away on a river of infant tears I don t know I didn t see it they never go as well it s back in the news now the Princess Diana Memorial fountain last year people know oh it s great it s what she would have wanted it s a place where families can hang out children can play it s what Princess Diana would have wanted it isn t what Princess Diana would have wanted to be to have not been killed and then in death not to have become the unwitting receptacle but a hysterical over emotional shrieking grief of twats that s what she would have didn t even work didn t even work that s no children were supposed to be able to play in it they kept thawing over breaking their arms and legs they made it out of slate or sheets of ice or something they were getting dog shit eye blindness disease from the water in the end they had to close it down fence it off put warning signs on it like a decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear reactor don t go near the Princess Diana Memorial fountain it s dangerous don t even look at it you ll get cancer and dive on away but it s ridiculous there should be a memorial to her there should be a memorial to her because she did some amazing things she worked well work with charity and landmines she got one GCSE in domestic science and to achieve that and only that when born into such a position of privilege and wealth requires a steely determination of focus you ve got to know from an early age but you want to achieve next to nothing and work hard it when all you re doing your favour and that s where there should be a memorial to her the people s princess right that s what i m going to make my own i m going to make my own memorial fountain to the princess Diana Memorial fountain it s going to be called the princess Diana Memorial fountain memorial fountain fountain but it s not going to be some state approved vicon alphore subsidized architectural car bunker it s going to be simple but she would have wanted it s just going to be me lying on my back in hide park near the princess Diana Memorial fountain naked with a colander over my penis every hour on the hour I ll piss up through that children can come and play it if they want families together and I don t want you can do it yourselves glass go do it yourself you don t even need a colander that s gilding the lily to be honest just do a piss anywhere you want in the street in your house in a library in an anti natal unit in the face of a treasured family pet or an elderly relative and if a policeman says to you what are you doing what an earth do you think you re doing madame just saying I m paying tribute in the only way I understand to the memory of princess Diana princess of Wales I ve been stupidly thanks a lot for bearing with us tonight oh I m a queen of the world listen people back the way goes all you got to do is make a little choice for us I I I I m a queen of the world I I I I m a queen of the world I don t care what the people say I don t know my listening to it goes all I I m a queen of the world I I I I m a queen of the world in I I I </s> <s> </s>"

He claims he had two weeks to live and it was his dying wish to meet Michael Jackson . </s> <s> Come on , man . Give me a fucking break . His kid is 10 years old . He don t remember Thriller .

I d have to already be free . That s ridiculous . I was like , if I m dying in two weeks and go , oh , mama . Get me in the room with Chubby Chaco . I wouldn t want to meet that in the fuck of that . My leg is two weeks . Why not usher somebody like this ? So then the kid claims . He goes to Michael s house . This is where it all gets crazy . Like , you know , he does everything you d expect at Michael s house . Climb trees and rolled rollercoasters and Ferris wheels . The chef made cookies , pies and cakes . They was petting them over here and drafts . Sings songs , kids shit . And in the middle of all this child like activity . For some reason , Mike pulled out some wine and some pills .

I ve been in court for a year and a half because for all the time I saved you . And when that . . . This is fucked up . I shouldn t even say that it s fucked up . Wouldn t be some ironic shit if they found out through this case that the cure for cancer was Michael Jackson sucking the dick somehow . But if Michael had powers like Green Mow and all the kids like , please , Mike , suck out eggs . I ll never again . You need an appreciator . Can we at least study your saliva ? Please , Mike . This is been stopped . This doesn t stop . And the only reason I can talk about Mike is because he s a freak . He s a freak . That s why people let you talk about it . Because if I brought up Catholic , please fucking kids . I don t get quiet as shit . But . . . When Michael Jackson does it is okay because he s a freak . </s> <s> His face is all cut up .

Our Kelly pissed on his victim . I know it was rough . But I mean , again , I can t even judge our Kelly . First of all , we don t know these allegations . True , and that even they are true . If you want to know how I feel about it honestly , I don t want to be in show business anymore . That s why I got the gang , baby . I got dreams too . You guys are confusing the issue . Why do you guys are busy worrying about if our Kelly even peed on this girl ? You know , I asked myself the real question . That America needs to decide once and for all . </s> <s> And that question is , how old is 15 really ? Oh , that s a good question . That s a good question . I m not saying that a person is as smart as they re going to be at 50 . That s not what I m saying , man . But I am saying 15 to me is old enough to decide whether or not she want to be pissed on . That s me . You can t make a decision like that by the time you re 15 . Just give up motherfucker because life is way harder than that . I make tougher decisions all the time . If you don t want to get pissed , I want to just get the fuck out of the way . It s not even a decision . If I start peeing on the front row , they re not going to have to calculate it . How do I feel about this , my okay , but they just move . You can do that at 15 . I could have been 15 . My was 15 . I was doing stand up in the night clubs . A small grateful time , time . Friends were selling crack . It s trying to finger fuck people . I knew what was happening around me to some degree . Getting pissed on was the least of my worries at 15 . I was like , trust me . But it keeps coming up . It s a lot of confusion around that age . Anytime 15 comes up , people freak out . Like when that girl Elizabeth Smog got kidnapped . Right ? Remember when you told last year s 15 girl Elizabeth Smog was kidnapped ? And then they found her in the whole country who was relieved . And I was the only one saying to him . She wasn t that smart after all . Not because she got kidnapped . That could happen to anybody . I m not going to for that . I m just saying if you kidnapped me when I was 15 , you got to take me further than eight miles away from my house . Man , God damn . Can t hold me prison around . Shit , I recognize . I ll break away . I ll break away . Fuck off me . That s my bus stop . I know I m at home . She was missing for six months , eight miles away from my house . That s two exits , man . That s nothing . And while she was missing during this half a year that this girl was missing , it s a seven year old black girl gets kidnapped and fill it down for you . Nobody knows her name . They might have talked about it two or three times on the news , but she should have been the top store . Because she chewed through the ropes and had both of these motherfuckers in jail and 45 minutes flat . </s> <s> Seven years old . I m not making this up . There s two crack hairs kidnapped and took them back to the crack house and tied her up . And then they left her . There s a crack hairs . I got to make moves , crack smoke , chocolate , and heat . You know motherfuckers may lose as I was . But as soon as they left this little girl got the nibbler . She s kidnapped at four o clock and at home watching herself on news at five thirty . That shit is crazy . That s a new story . That is a new story . Now , meanwhile in Utah , 15 year old Elizabeth s smarts captors left her alone too . And they didn t even tie her up because they built this . They just bounced . Don t try to escape , bet your kill you . Be right back . At least she s 15 sitting in the house by herself . Come on , I m gonna get out of this . Come on , Elizabeth . Think . Think Elizabeth , I m not gonna get out of here . Why d she just open the fucking door and go outside ? Have you thought about that ? Do you have a quarter ? Do you know your phone number ? 15 bitch run . Stop thinking and start making moves . I know I sound mean . And I know what the people are thinking when I m saying this day , she is only 15 . All right . But that s the discrepancy because when you talk about a little girl like Elizabeth s smart , the country feels like 15 is so young and so innocent . And when you talk about a 15 year old black kid in Florida , this black kid accidentally killed his neighbor when he s practicing wrestling moves that he saw on TV . Now , was he a kid ? No . They gave him life and always try our 15 years as adults . This is make or nobody was doing . So God damn pile driver . This kid gets on the ropes , there s no stopping him . You have to send the rock to arrest him . And they gave a 15 year old boy life and jail . If you think that it s okay to give him life and jail , this should be legal to pee on him . That s all I m saying . You got to make up your mind across the board . Powered 15 actually is . And that s all I m saying . So I m gonna tell you right now that somebody comes in here and puts a gun in my head and says , you re pal , you got a choice to make .

Lay through me out . The dirtiest place I ve ever been thrown out of and just a given idea of what I mean by dirty . Latvances at this place . Three dollars . It s fucking disgusting . At the same time , who could pass up a sale ? Son , it was three dollars . Of course I did it . It s only 12 quarters . So now I break a fire for that . I ve never seen somebody work this half a three dollars . This lady must have been the throwback to the great depression . She was all over me . It s the first time I ever told a stripper to get off of me . Alright . Yeah , thank you very much , miss . Thank you . That ll be all . That s enough , thank you . Hey ! Hey , get off of me ! Whatever happened to lipstick on the collar lady ? I have a shit streak on the middle of my shirt . How the fuck am I going to explain this when I get home ? Oh no baby , me and Bob were playing basketball and Bob don t throw me . It was hanging on the rim and his pants fell down . I was checking the clothes I think was swinging . And his butt cheeks might , uh , up . His butt cheeks I think caught my shirt . I don t know why I was playing ball in my dress shirt . This was , it was midnight . I don t know , what the fuck ? What s that we think ? That s what , that s what you know guys laying in the seat , lady . Hold on , let me think . The man I m saying it to you . Hold on , let me think for a minute , can I think ? We all went there . You guys make too much progress , too fast . Not too much , but you just , you re confused by , you made so much progress , you even confused .

And you don t do anything . You re the fuck of a saying . Tell them all the fuck what , do I see women doing this to men all the time ? Come on ! Oh man , what s that shit ? There s one anybody that tell me what to do that much . You got to work with me . Like if it makes a man feel like a man to watch the game for men , and if he happens to look over what he wants watching the game , don t look at him on me and make him feel guilty about watching it . Just pick up your own teddy and suck it . Just try it out . It will instantly remember why he fell in love . Oh , that s right . That s right . That , my girl sucks . I don t take it from time to time . I can t walk away from that . It s too hard to fight . You see that ? 20 seconds . He s still going to be as busy as he wants to suck the haunted and everything s cool . Well , how about this ? If you make a love to your man , you already make a love . My eyes will spice it up , right ? How about this ? I personally like it . I like it when a girl tells me where to come . I don t like it when a girl tells me when to come . I hate this . Don t come yet . Oh , bitch , all these rules . Instead of doing that , why don t you just tell us where to make us feel better , especially if you re aggressive about it .

It s some privilege of mine to have super great groove SPG Super great groove try it by including a world like a tribe with all of the most beautiful dancers Castle club Thank you bottle . Thank you . Thank you . Oh , it feels good . That s all the time I needed to fill . I appreciate that . Thank you . That was great . I m feeling good . I actually just recently had to go to the emergency room , though , and I had some stomach virus thing . I almost called an ambulance . It s weird . I mean , considering calling an ambulance for yourself , you know . You call an ambulance for other people , right ? What are you supposed to say about yourself ? Can you come get me ? You know , I don t feel so good . Just come on and I ll be lying on a floor . I m just looking at the phone going , I don t know how to do this . I don t know what to do . It was at night , so I drove myself to the emergency room . That s a nice relaxing drive . No , after you . I remembered . I remember you . I remember you . I remember you . Everybody merge . I m only imploding . So , I pull up at the entrance to the emergency room . and where you want to go . Can you park this ? Because I need to collapse immediately . But no , I m circling around a parking lot . But I park that . I think I m going to die . I m dying too . OK , go ahead . I ll go up a couple levels . I m going to go up a couple levels . I m going to leave . I don t care if you re driving yourself or someone else to the emergency room . You still want to get out and run in with them . Are you supposed to drop somebody off and go park a car ? OK , you go in . Tell them you re shot . Ask them if they validate . I m leaving . So I finally park , you know . I go into check in . They ask the most insulting question when you re checking to a hospital . What seems to be the problem ? What seems . . . Well , it seems . Well , it seems . It seems like everything on my inside wants to be on my yow . But I m no doctor . What kind of condescending question ? So they check me into my luxurious half room . It s a curtain down the middle with a mystery patient on the other side . And he s mowning over there . Mowning over there . Like , man , they re never going to help me with him mowning like that . So I got to out mown him , you know . Mowning over . Mowning over . What moment will hurt me ? The whole floor is like a haunted choir . Waaaaaaah ! It s gotta be how the workin is in burnin . So I m killing time arriving . Nurse finally comes in . How are you doin tonight ? I m on a journey . You have a paint killer or something . This is killing me . So she goes , how would you describe your pain ? </s> <s> It s killing . And I don t know if you remember that . Ouch . But are we playing that pyramid game ? Um , excruciating . Horrific . Good rather have shards of glass in my eyes . I know I can bet this team . So she asks , how would you rate your pain ? Fair stars . I m gonna say , I m gonna say , I m gonna say , I m gonna say , I m gonna say , two enthusiastic thumbs up . She goes , how would you rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the worst ? You know what I m sayin ? A low number is gonna help you . Oh , I m a two . Maybe the high ones . You can give me a baby aspirin and cut it in hand . Maybe a flin stone vitamin . You can go 10 all the threes and fours and cents . Anyone saying such ridiculous numbers ? I couldn t bring myself to say 10 though because I had heard the worst pain a human can endure is getting the femur bone cracked in half . I don t know if that s true , but I thought if it is , they have exclusive rights to 10 . And now I m thinking , what was I worried about ? Is there like a femur ward at the hospital ? They would have heard about me and hobbled into my room . Who the hell ? How do you are gasoline ? The thing you were got a level 10 . You know nothing about 10 . Give me a slide , Chairman . Let me show you what 10 is all about . Mr . Tommy . No ! No ! What can I possibly say ? I can t . So I thought I ll say 9 . And then I thought no , childbirth . They re better not try to compete with me . And then I think it , you know almost be hell giving childbirth when your femur bone s cracked . So I said , I guess I m an age . She goes , oh , okay , I ll be back . I m like , oh , I blew it . I ain t getting nothing with age . But she surprised me . She comes in and goes , the doctor told me to give you morphine immediately . And I m like , morphine . That s what the guy who s saving pride or Ryan right before he died . I ll come , I m a four . I m a zero . I m a negative 11 team . morphine . So they gave me morphine . Wow . All I know is about 15 minutes later , just for the hell of it I was like , I m an 8 again . Guess who s an 8 ? And they finally checked me out . I m walking out in the hall going , say 8 , say 8 , say 8 , say 8 . </s> <s> Copy 8 , day . Did you get some height ? Did you took it on the old ? I m throwing , you can t throw a number . Johnny , you ll see . Did you get any 8 over there ? I don t understand my own visuals . I m throwing numbers around . I m fine now , I think , I don t know . So they sent me to my regular doctor for a follow up and I was nervous going because my cholesterol . . . I knew it was going to be high because last year it was high and I hadn t done anything different . What are the odds your cholesterol is going to plummet for no reason . Come on 200 , come on on . 337 , how can that be ? My Burger King coupons and my pong . It s inexplicable . So I was nervous . And I realized that s the only time as an adult that I feel like a little kid . Because when I go to the doctor , you didn t do what I told you did you . No , I m not like that . What should you have done ? I should have listened when you were talking to me . What are you going to do from now on ? Pay attention when you say things . When are you going to start ? I m going to start right now . Me , but . . . It s all doctor . He s a good doctor , I think . I told him I get heartburn sometimes . So he goes and gets me a list of things that cause heartburn . I m looking at the list and I m like . . . I already know this . I don t have to get it . That s not going into the hospital with a cannonball wound and they show you a list . Here s how you get cannonball wounds . I already . . . I have a cannonball wound . It s gave me ! Do you have a tube of cannonball wound doing this ? No . Number one , do not stand directly in front of a cannon . How true that is . I m not a good doctor . I m not a good doctor . I m not a good doctor . So my doctor looks at me and says you should probably drop a couple pounds , everyone . Thank you . Only your doctor has cart blanch on insults . You just insult your for a while and then you pay him for the insults on the way out . Well , you should lose some weight and those moles are looking pretty weird . All right , how much for that , Doc ? What can we get together again ? Big fat , mull man walking out of your office . Thanks for the confidence boost . I m off to the Macy s Day parade . Grab a rope ! How does he care ? You re big and you re ugly . He does care . Doctors are good people . That s why they avoid the word pain . </s> <s> It s a buzzword . They won t hit it a lot . They don t want to scare anybody . Doctors , we ll tell you all about pressure . We ll tell you all about the pressure you re going to experience . If a doctor tells you you re about to feel some pressure , buck a lot . In a moment , you re going to feel a little bit of pressure . Go down ! A pressure who long held ? Pressure . All pain involves pressure . That s one of the definitions of pain . You could be swinging a two by four at your head . In a moment , you re going to feel a little bit of pressure . Hey , bring it on . I m good under pressure . I like pressure situations . Oh , so my doctor , he told me to watch what I m eating , told me to read food labels . I m in a store reading the Fig Newton s label . I ve always liked Fig Newton s . I m trying to see if it s okay to eat them . Everything looked fine , the fat content . I looked at the serving size , two cookies . What a hell , it s two cookies . Fig Newton s by the sleeve . Two sleeves is a serving size . I open them both and eat them like a treat , you ever want to . . . Fig Newton shadys coming off the side . Fig Newton shadys coming off the side . I put a Newton catcher and he did that bag out of his ass . I know they talk about two Fig Newton s . For the size of a poachist amp , you want another one who I don t know . I ve already had two whole entire Fig Newton s . Maybe I can try to muscle one more down , but I don t think I m gonna . . . Oh , wrong stuff to the rat ! They re nuts . We got a new arm here . We got a three Fig Newton eater . How many did he have ? What is he , nuts ? He doesn t eat weed ! Who s coming up with serving sizes ? The serving size of ice cream is a half a cup . What is that ? Is that like a joke some guy put on here ? Hey , come here , look what I put for the serving size . I just did it as a joke , but they re going out like that . I don t know what to do . Just let it go , I guess there s nothing you can do now . You ever know anybody to eat a half a cup of ice cream ? Hey , you want to go grab something to eat ? You want a half a cup of ice cream ? Yeah , a whole half a cup . I just kept eating and eating and I must have had two spoonfuls . I think a serving size of ice cream is when you have the spoon hit the bottom of your tongue . You can t do this anymore . </s> <s> I ripped the side . I m not sure what they re talking about with a half a cup of ice cream . I have to lay off dairy though . That s what my doctor threw in as I was leaving his office . Oh , I know lay off dairy . What the . . . Sweet as that . I know more happiness . What were you ? What was he care ? I m trying to lay off dairy . I m in the supermarket with my little cart and I m trying to avoid the dairy aisle . I can see they ll have party hats on over there . I mean the juice aisle . Sloped over with juice people . I learned something in the juice aisle and that is . . . I don t know what s going on with cranberries but they re getting in all the other juices . Whoever the salesman is for cranberries does a great job . He s showing up everywhere . Hey , what do you got apples ? Put some cranberries in them . We ll call it cranberry and apple . Go 50 50 . What do you got grapes ? How about cranberry ? What do you got mangoes ? What do you got ? Pulled champs ? Cranchons . Why don t you back off cranberry ? Why don t you take your sales trophy and have a vacation ? It s working too hard . Just making the other fruit guys feel bad , you know ? Like the banana guy wakes up . Man , I ain t into nothing . Cranberries all coupled up . You gotta get cracking banana now . Gotta get on a stick . My doctor also told me to eat more fruit . I had some pot tarts this morning . Nice thin layer in there . You ever look at a pot tarts box ? They have directions on there . Can there be a simpler food item than pot tarts ? Like the directions weren t on there with somebody . What the ? Gotta wipe good , that goodness in me ! What did he do ? How did he get it done ? You read , man . That s what you do . They have two sets of directions . In case you don t understand one set , you abandon that whole track and get on something little easier for yourself . They have a set of toaster directions , which believe it or not , is more than one step . I have to get there possibly . Be more than one step . I can only think of one . Step one , toast the pot tarts . Go ahead , toast them . Hey , are you still breathing this ? But they ve managed to break them into smaller increments . These are some of the actual steps . I would love to be in the room watching somebody else to consult these toaster steps . Okay , number one , remove pastry from pouch . I see where they re going with this . We re banging on all cylinders . Number two , insert pastry vertically . Oh , oh . They re reading toaster directions . You re going to throw the vertical concept at them . Then they have a whole set of microwave directions . That just blew me away that you could actually microwave a pop tart . How long does it take to toast a pop tart ? </s> <s> A minute ? If you want them dark ? People don t have that kind of time . Listen , if you need to zap fry your pop tart before you head out the door , you might want to loosen up your schedule . And I swear it says microwave on high for three seconds . I don t think I want to wake up and be eaten in three seconds . The alarm goes up . You re waking in and halling in three seconds . You re booking yourself two times . Pick up some Montana brochures or something . You know , living problems . We just moved . I called UPS , asking to help out with some boxes . Now , they re a good service , but you have to have information ready about your boxes before you even call them . I had no idea . I called them up . You don t have a ten box to come pick them up . We need to know the weight and the girth . Okay , goodbye . So I called back . We need the weight and the girth . Okay , I don t know what the weight is . And I don t know what girth means . So now what s the procedure ? So this guy talks to me like I m four years old . Well , do you have a bathroom scale ? Yeah , but if I put the box in a scale , it s going to cover up the numbers . What do I take them off really quick ? Ah , zero . I m not fast enough . Is he talking about it ? So then he gives me like his Mr . Wizard formula . How about a few stand on the scale and weigh yourself . Get off the scale . Pick up the box , get back on weight . You hit the box together and subtract your own weight . I m going slow down . Hold on , professor . I know this guy s never tried this because I tried it and you still can t see the numbers . Is that one of my Mr . Olympia ? Three pounds . Then I had to hang up in the middle of his girth formula . That was easy . The girth is simple to figure out . You take the length and double that by the smaller of the height . You try to get the hypotenuse from the third side . I m getting another call . I m just going to step in a talk . I m just going to be on with you any longer . This is true . I figured I would call back and just make up some numbers . Let him come out and pick him up . It s wrong . I ll pay the difference . Dispatch the truck . I have 10 boxes and no , I m another guy . Then I ll weigh exactly 22 pounds and they ll have a girth of three . Three girth units . Come pick him up . I m begging you . They re boxes and they re brown and they have tape all on them . Then they ll probably fit on a dolly . </s> <s> Why must you torture me ? We needed a refrigerator for our new place . I ve never bought a refrigerator . My whole life , I went into the appliance store . There s a 900 of them lined up . There s a salesman there . What s this guy supposed to say about refrigerators ? Well , you have this refrigerator right here . This keeps all your food cold for 600 . I ve got this refrigerator . This keeps all your food cold for 800 . Check this out . 1400 keeps all your food cold . This guy s working me on this one . I ve never seen a guy work so hard . This one is a very nice refrigerator . It has a meat drawer . What you do with that , you would put meat . Whatever varieties that you would choose , these would be your meats . There s no requirement on the types of meat you could pick . Bacon . Marbled meats . There s an endless selection . And this one also has a crisper for crispy things . Potato chips . Look in the door when the door is open . This has an egg area . And that s a very nice thing . It s an area for eggs . You put them all in the egg area . You come home and you go , hey , where are the eggs ? Right in the egg . And they re all written in person . And that s a real nice feature . It is . That is a nice touch . We also had to get the phone turned on . I m at my friend s house . I call the phone company . Can you turn on our telephone ? Okay , it s going to be a problem . I figured , how ? Why ? That s just going to be a big nightmare . That s our policy . It s going to be a nightmare . Something about a hell on earth . It s different than I thought . I didn t know how it worked . So I asked them , how does that work ? Do we have to wait in our home for a few days for the phone ? People that come out ? No , we do it differently now . We can just flip the switch from right here . Great . Can you go ahead and flip it ? We re going to flip it next Thursday . Can you flip it right now ? We re going to flip it Thursday , late , or Friday , or sometime at no time . Can you see it from where you re at ? Can I go down and flip it ? I don t know . I guess there s only one flip switcher . He has a lot to get to . I assume they re tiny . Maybe they re big giant switches . They re really hard to flip . Man , he s never going to get to my house . </s> <s> I want to go down here and cheer him on . Go switch , flip or go . Flip them switches . Flip them , go . Flip them , go . Flip them , go . Flip them , go . Flip them , go . Flip them , go . Flip them . Flip them , go . Flip them , go . Flip them , go . Good job . That s great . So how do you use a phone to book the flight to come here ? The reservation is giving you a confirmation code . Mike , I m an idiot . She gives it to me like this . He has a call . He has a call . Slow down . He has a call . I know . I know all about kite . And he was in quadmire . I want to fly so bad . I call back to confirm the flight . She went on another confirmation code . I don t know about you , but I feel like an idiot trying to quickly come up with words for letters . I m panicking on a phone . The confirmation code is BS and . . . . . . big beans . Piazzan pneumonia . K Zen cut offie . And Q Zen cut offie . They only do that with letters . Nobody ever does that with numbers . Mike told it s a 4 10 . . . . . . 423 . 2 10 . . . . . . 2 , 941 . . . . . . no , 47 . I m going to be short code . Sometimes you ll get a confirmation code that includes zeros and o s . You write them the same way . They re completely different keys . They ll give you the number one and the letter i . You write those the same . They re different keys . A small o s looks the same . They don t care . You ll never be able to communicate this back clearly . Here s your confirmation code . You re going to need this for your vacation . OK , it s 1 1 i 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 i small l . Yes . Boyage . You know , I flew here . How come the first class people just . . . . . . they can just get on whenever they want ? I ve always hated that . First class people board it . You re the leisure . Take your time for the first class people . Mmm . Code s people don t wait . Sit . Sit . Cuts . Weight little piggies . So when you do get on , the first class people , they re already sitting there . They re all sprawled out and they re big thrones . Bring me the head of a pig . And a goblet of something cool and refreshing . Anyone have a fiddle ? Make someone from Coach Fiddlephone . But who s me ? If fiddle s any overhead racks up there . You re not allowed to even use their bathrooms . The bathrooms up front are for our first class passengers . The coach bathrooms are located at Newark Airport . </s> <s> Tom Corsi . Tom Corsi , ladies and gentlemen . So when you do board , the first class people , they re sitting there . A lot of them are working as you re boarding . They re having computers out in calculators . They re looking up at you like , hey , we re making money right now . Right now we re making money . Go getting a back . Close that curtain . Not a wanna save it . Even in my peripheral . Snap it . Snap it . Shot . And then you re gonna have to cover it up with a tarp . You go in the back , everybody has coloring books . Hey , come here . Where was you ? Where was you at ? You re in the middle . And there s nine of us . And you re in the middle . And we have all the armrests . You gotta figure out a way to eat your snack while your elbows are touching . You gotta learn how to twist your little plastic utensil . I like to sit way in the back . Way in the back . Except for one thing , all the good meals running out . You know , you re poking your head out from road 199 . The flight attendants are this big . You can hear the good meals getting snagged . We have a turkey sandwich , a chicken quesadilla , and a cold fish head . I m just . . . I wonder what I m gonna get . So when they get to the back of the plane , they have to do that flight attendant psychology game . We tend like the good stuff never even existed . It never even was . Would you like a nice cold fish head ? They re frozen solid . Frozen had a fish . The eyeballs in there and the skeletons coming out . It comes with a turn up and a spork . I was wishing you d have one of them left . Wishing upon a star . But I admire flight attendants , man . It really do . They put up with a lot of garbage from people . Have you ever been sitting in your seat and you see somebody trying to fit something in the overhead rack that you know ain t going in there like in a million years ? Have like a mattress and a lamp . You re looking at them like , what kind of perception problems is this guy had ? And the flight attendants are always nice . They always run up and act like it might maybe fit . Oh , I don t know if that s going to get up there . We can check it for you . You re more run . I know that s what they want to say . I would last about eight seconds at that job . I ll just get up there and this guy looks like it s going to fit . Yep , that s my true . You have a dead yak . Are you okay ? You don t see all these people jammed up waiting on you . </s> <s> You don t see any of that . Oh , this is your world . It s all about you . You let us know when you re all set , Captain you , planet . And I feel bad for the gate agents because they try to get the boarding process to run smoothly . But no one will listen to them . Don t blame them . They try to get on the intercom . Ladies and gentlemen , we re about to begin boarding . If we could ask for your cooperation , would you all please remain seated until your row has been called ? Everyone please please remain seated . Everyone please back away from the gate . Somehow by the time that comes out the speakers , it must sound like everybody up and rush the door . Everyone immediately try to squish your fat butt simultaneously in the small gate or area . Hurry , push and shove everyone , push and shove . Do whatever you have to to get on board . This is the last helicopter out of Vietnam . I m embarrassed to be human . I want to get on . You re going to get on . I want to get on before you leave ! Law . Human beings , man , I m sure you ve been at airports with the moving sidewalks . You know the whole stand right walk left concept ? Well , for some people , unlearnable . You ain t getting it in , no matter how much stimuli you offer . I ve been on them right on understand how people don t see that that s the system . It s a baby yellow dotted line going down the middle and it s stenciled every three feet on the sidewalk . Stand , stand , stand , stand , walk , walk , walk . On the handrail , stand , stand , walk , walk . If you re a stand , walk , pictures of people standing , walk , and I ve seen footprints together in a park . And you still have people riding that left handrail . It s fun to fly . Watch them close because they re the ones at the end of the moving sidewalk . Something change . Something change . I m trying to get into inventing . I know what I m going to try to invent . I don t know if I m being overly ambitious , but I m trying to invent an ironing board that when you open it , it doesn t sound like this . Every ironing board , if ever , opens , sounds like a witch being boiled and oiled . There ll be a Japanese toy in the lab , I don t know . You ever just look at an ironing board ? Can you imagine getting that approved in today s safety conscious world ? What did you want to get an approval on ? I call it an ironing board . I want to have a surfboard shaped device about this high , and I want to support it with two thin , criss crossing poles . </s> <s> So the center of gravity is precariously high . So the slightest nudge , be sure to topple it .

I want one side to be a white hot heat for scarring . I want the sheer weight to be able to cause blunt force trauma . I want the whole thing to come to a point for puncture wounds . It seems a little unsafe for adults . I m not finished . I want a cord coming down so you get the toddlers involved . Why are we allowed to have these ? Inventions and trigby . I was reading about the walkie talkie , and I read it was a military invention . That surprised me , because usually military stuff has strong names . I ll patch you helicopter . Tomahawk missile . Walkie talkie . How did that slip through the system ? It s a general talk . What do you have there , soldier ? Well , it s a new communication device . It s untethered , but we ll enable the troops to speak effectively when they re in the field . What s it called ? Walkie talkie . Look , I m walking and I m talking . Now you walk in talking , general . I m walking , talking . Are you walking , talking ? I like it , soldier . What s this explosive device ? The wire minkle blammy . And this is the Rudy Tudierme in shoot . Walkie talkie . I m wearing new contacts . I just had my prescription changed after six years . You ever wait that long ? Then you get new lenses ? You re like , man , I could have been seeing things . How can instantly improve vision not be at the top of your to do list ? I ll see tomorrow . I don t have time . I don t have time to see clearly . No , I don t . No , I can t do that . You see what s on my desk ? So I go in for the eye exam . I don t know about you , but I concentrate like crazed your knee eye exam . You don t want to get a deon at thing . End up with these big thick clothe bottle lenses . I didn t take it serious . Are you still in here ? I m just seeing shadows and shakes . It s important . I don t call it a quiz . So I go in there . I sit in that big chair . He slides that big giant thing on my face . Are these my glasses ? What happened to me ? I m going to be a hell of a pair of glasses . Do I look a better like this ? Or like this ? I like this one when I want to see that one again . That was pretty good with us . Go back to that one . I hate that test because I can t commit . I can feel my doctor losing his patience with him . </s> <s> Let s try it again , Brian . Which one do you like better ? Number one or number two ? I don t like either one of those . That wasn t the question I asked . I asked you which one you like better and I was careful to phrase it that way . So why don t you keep that in mind while we try it yet again ? Which one do you like better ? Number two . Through about the same . Well , why would I waste your time and mind by making them both the same ? Did you ever stop to think about that ? You ready to try it one more time ? What do you want from me ? Way too much pressure during that entire exam . They do one test every time . I don t know what they re looking for . All I know is I get an anxiety attack in the middle of the damn thing . Tell me the exact moment point A is directly over point B . Now ! Now ! Now ! Now ! I don t know . I don t know what would happen . I m worried if I m off on 8th of a second I ll get these big giant Hubble coming at tracks and glasses . So you must have messed up that A , B test . Dead eye ever . What are they helping me with ? My ability to watch cars pass on the highway . They pass now ! And they pass now ! Man , how do you do it ? It s weird in the eye exam room . It s just him and me . It s dark in there . The door s closed . I feel strange when he pulls his chair up uncomfortably close to you . He s like this far from my face . He shines his goofy light into my eyes for about an eternity . How you doing , man ? I m a little uncomfortable . Can you back up a tag ? Are you looking at my soul ? You want a tick tick ? So he says , you know you have one eye set a little bit higher than your other eye ? No . I did not . Because it doesn t affect your vision or anything . I just thought you might want to be self conscious for the rest of your life . I went out to my car mirror . I m kind of monster . Is that a hump ? I m not an animal . I am a man ! It s a matter of them . Then he asked me , would you like to try focus ? I m like , I must have been away a while because I have no idea what you re talking about . He says it s exactly what you would think . You can see it three different distances depending on where you look through your lens . You can see close , medium , or far away . I can t even imagine you re going to use to that . There s a book . </s> <s> There s a play . There s a placenta . Do people need this kind of range ? Is that a flyer ? My nose is out of comment ? I m actually kind of quiet off stage . A lot of people don t realize that . I was at a dinner party recently . A bunch of people that I don t know . One guy talking , plenty for everybody . Me , myself , rather than I . And then myself . I couldn t tell this one about I because I was talking about myself . And then me . Me . Me . Me . You wear the meme , Monster . So I tried to jump in with a little story . I don t want to just sit there the whole night . When I m done with my story , this guy goes , Nothing . Didn t mean to waste everybody s time . Tellin my nothin story . Here , let Mark go pullo speak . He s back with tales of adventure . Story ain t nothin . Maybe it wasn t because I made the mistake of trying to tell a story about having only two wisdom teeth pulled . And I learned a lesson . Don t ever try to tell a two wisdom tooth story because you ain t goin nowhere . Before wisdom teeth people are gonna parachute in and cut you off at the past . Halt with your two wisdom tooth tales . You will never complete one . Trust me . I m trying to tell my story . You know I had some wisdom teeth pulled . I had two black floor pulled . Oh , I m happy . No five . No nine . I had nine wisdom teeth pulled . All of mine were impacted . They were all coming upside down . The roots are up on my tongue , coming up my nose . They were tossed . Tellin us a war log . No anesthesia . They pulled them out with pliers . I was even caught in the cab that afternoon . Pin the blue ribbon upon his chest . That knocks the socks off of my wisdom tooth tale . Why do people need the top other people ? I ve never understood it and I see it all the time . Obviously people get something out of it . At best people wait for your lips to stop . Yeah . Okay . Yeah , you me . You me . You see the difference ? You see that ? Now what I do . What is it about the human condition ? People get something out of that . That s why I have a social fantasy . I wish I was one of the 12 astronauts who have been on our moon . They must love knowing they can beat anybody s story . Whenever they want . They can sit back quietly at a dinner party while some other person , some me mots who s doing his thing and let him go . Let him run with the line while you be quiet . I don t know . I don t know . Let him have his moment . Yeah , I m a big traveler . </s> <s> I have my business all . I got a loan . I have to check . I m driving in the Autobahn because people flee to sports . I m sure I can get a Swiss account . Mount Kilimanjarox . Runways in Aspen . The first time you go in here . I m going to take that over . I m going to go in the middle of the night . Everybody , get over it . Run , get over it . I walked on the moon . Well , you have the floor , moonwalker . You know , you mentioned driving on the Autobahn that reminded me . Once I was driving in the sea of tranquillity . And my lunar rover . And I too was worried about our speedteller . Remember , why ? Who are the only ones on the moon ? You guys are great . Thank you very much . Thank you so much . Thank you so much . Appreciate it . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .

        "title": "Ginger Kid Steve Hofstetter - Full Special",
        "transcript": "<s> Hey right files . Hello ? Hi , you folks have been amazing to me over the years . Like , men s winning the world s serious amazing . That d be pretty amazing .

You guys ready to go ? Back you go . Where you going ? Turn it down . And please , block the stage steveoffsetter , everybody . Back to ground . Get ready for another round . Get ready for another round . Come on , let s go . Come on . Yeah . That s it . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Thank you . Woo . Woo . I m excited to see you , too . I actually came here to , I came here to float a theory . I have a theory that children are going to be the solution . All the stupidity , all the ignorance that we have in this world . I was teased a lot as a kid because I have red hair and everyone else is an asshole . That s really how life works your red head . Like , if you don t have red hair , you might not know this , but you ve always teased us . Like , your grandfather teased redheads and his grandfather teased redheads and his grandfather teased redhead because his grandfather got raped by a Viking . And then we re serious then . Yeah , the Viking s raped a lot of people . And now I have red hair and that s science . The rape joke is a science joke . </s> <s> Don t worry , the Vikings have stopped that behavior . The Vikings do not rape people anymore . That isn t the past . The Vikings do not rape people . The Steelers sure do . The Vikings have stopped . That isn t fair to me to say . I don t know if the Steelers don t rape people . The quarterback does . The rest of the team protests . The rest of the team is like , no , not us . Ben Lossberger likes to rape people . And that s still unfair to me to say because I don t know if he likes it . Like , he does it , but maybe he doesn t enjoy it . Maybe he s like , this is bad for me too . I don t know how it happens . But I do know it happens . Here s how I know what happens . Because I am not insane . And you d have to be a crazy person just filled with cognitive dissonance to not believe that Ben Lossberger is a raven . Here s how I know . There was security tape of one of the incidents . And it was destroyed . They say it was coincidence . It s happening destroyed . Why else is it ? It s a crime . It s a crime . It s a crime . What other possible reason ? Was there just something else on the tape coincidentally we couldn t see ? Like a ghost . We re just not ready for that . Maybe that s what it was . It s a ghost and consensual sex . That s all it was . It s a creepy three way , from beyond the grave . That s possible . I ll never root for Ben Lossberger ever again . I will never root for the Steelers as long as he plays for that team . I cannot root for them . He s won two Superbowls . And he is raped to women . And I can do the math . I don t want to win a third Super Bowl because we celebrate differently than other people . Yeah , it s that kind of show . It just bothers me when people buy jerseys , buy a Rothsburger or a Vic jersey for their kid . Like those guys are roll mob . That bothers me and especially insults me as a redhead because we don t have any roll mob . We don t have anybody . They re famous redheads but they don t stick up for us . George Washington had red hair . Did you even know that ? How many knows that ? Because he always wore that white wig . Because he had a country to lead . You can t get the respect you need to lead a nation as a redhead . His whole thing was I cannot tell a lie . Do you have red hair ? Shut up , that s silly . No . That s natural . JFK had red hair and they shot him . So has it been a redhead of President s sins ? It s been 50 years . There were eight of us . </s> <s> Eight redheads were President of the United States of America . There hasn t been one in 50 years because they invented color TV . Now people know we re not blonde anymore . Chris JFK had red hair at the end of the beginning started . Too soon , really ? We haven t dealt with that as a country yet . We re still reeling from something that happened before any of us were born . We re still , oh , that was so sad . My dad told me about that . Find your babies , alright ? Pop culture . Grey s anatomy has redheads . Yeah , the sexy don thers . Mixed steamy . Make a dreamy . And the redhead . Oh , and . Why don t no one get a nickname , huh ? I know why . So nicknames suck . My nicknames are terrible . Be mix steamy , make dreamy , and McDonald . That s why . We are hoping it s like caratops . Caratops are green . What the hell , man ? It s better than caratops . It s better than caratops . That d be stupid , but still . We get called ginger . And I hate that one . That s a slur . The word ginger is a slur . Here s how you can tell if a word is a slur . If you ve never heard it used in a positive way ever , pretty good barometer , I ve never heard , hey , look at that ginger . I like to take him to lunch . So it s like , hey , look at that ginger . Probably has no soul . Heard that a few times . I hope we have no soul . That d be great . One less hypercrashable when we rise up and kill the rest of you . To make it harder on yourselves . We re ginger . By the way , don t ever use that word . I really don t like the word . You can call me ginger . But . . . The ER is the offensive part of any word . That joke requires knowledge of hip hop culture . The word ginger comes from England , actually . Not South Park , but England . In England , it s used all the time . There s a major supermarket chain , St . Sparries , one of the biggest chains in England . At a Christmas card , it says , Sennel loves old children . You open it up , and it says , even ginger ones . Why is that okay ? What if that were any other group of people ? Would that be okay ? No ! Sennel loves old children , even Mexicans . No ! That would be ridiculous . Of course , Sennel loves Mexican children . They make the toys . Like what ? You know , love them . That s sure again offended by the comedians that have voted on immigration reform . It s a solid strategy for things . My point is , you don t mock someone for something they re born with . You want to tease me ? You tease me for my choices . When I come to meet for our red hair , I can make fun of you for your blonde , or fat , or Chinese , or blonde , fat and Chinese . </s> <s> And that s the exception . That s hilarious . You just never would see a fat blonde Chinese guy . Just make a wish . Because that s . . . It s a shot . They re in danger . Worst nickname we get is . . . We get called fiery . Hey , Donald . Yeah . We d angry quickly . We have short tempers . We d angry quickly . We re told this . We re the same people who ve been teasing us . Our entire fucking lives . Oh , you get angry so quickly . You re so fiery . No , no , no , we re not . It s a lifetime of accumulated rage . That s what this is . These aren t freckles . These are emotional scars . That s what you ve done . You ve done this to you . And it s never going to get better . With the last group that s ever going to get our thing . Now we re going to get better . What s going to happen ? We get together with some other redheads . We ll be like , you know what , I m tired of this . I m tired of being told I m different every day in my life . That I don t fit in . That I was born raw . We should show people that this hurts . They think they re kidding , but it hurts . We need to show people . We need to protest . We need to get together . We need to organize . We need to protest . That s what we should do . We should protest . We should march . That s what we got to do . We got to march . We got to go outside . We got to . . . Fucking swing . We got to wait till nightfall . Some of you think you know what it s like to be a redhead . Fuck you . I m getting sunburned from the stage like the other thing . What it s like to be us . I have to wear sunblock so strong , long sleeve shirt comes out of the bottle . That s how strong . I m going to wear a sunblock . I m going to wear a sunblock . I m going to wear a sunblock . That s how strong . I wear the highest SPF possible . SPF infinity . Yeah , they ve been . . . Yeah , just SPF 8 , it was this sideways . It s a typo . Still counts , but . . . Matt , joke on the half you liked . Man . . . It s just tough being teased by kids forever at hair . I don t even mean when I was a kid . I mean , like now . . . Like as an adult male . . . There s a full grown human being getting teased by children . I don t have kids . I don t have any kids . Because I met other people . Are there parents here ? Do we have parents here ? </s> <s> For the parents watching this , this is so important that you know this . You re not . . . . . . spatial . And I m tired of your shit . Parents walk around like having a kid makes you special . That s not true . Raising a good kid makes you special . Just having one . Having one . Who cares ? Raccoons do that all the time . Know them , brag ? I can t speak , but they don t . Raccoons have kids constantly . They re very pro life ass species . They ve never gotten an abortion . I don t think there s been one recorder raccoon abortion in history . I don t know if it s like a religious thing with them . Or maybe you could be the no science knowledge and the tiny paws . My point . . . . . . is that I just did an abortion joke like six minutes and I m like , sad . And I didn t intend to . Please understand . I didn t want to . I didn t know which direction that joke was going . But it went there . I had to finish it . Because once you conceive of that joke , if you don t tell it , then it s murder . So you have to tell the joke . No matter what , you don t sweat it . It was the first trimester in my set . So it s perfectly legal . It s a silly joke . You don t have to laugh with that joke . It s a silly joke . It s your right to choose whether or not you laugh . My point . That I like metaphor and if you don t , it s going to be a long ow . So . . . I have a belief that it takes more effort to order a pizza than it does to have a shot . That might sound harsh . But no one s ever ordered a pizza by accident . What s that ever happening , huh ? Is there open under your door ? Oh , this pizza guy didn t even . . . I was hoping God would stop the pizza . I m thinking . . . Because I don t have kids , sometimes people get mad at me when I talk to my kids and I say , how to gentlemen , come up to me after a show . Very , very upset with me . So until you ve understood the pressures of having a child , you can t possibly notice I d have a child . That s true . But I ve never flown a helicopter . Yet if I saw one in a tree , I could still be like , you d fucked up . I was so drunk , I could not suppose to happen . I have no experience with the matter . I don t expect a pilot to come at me . All the pistols . I m still going to strip the pressures of flying a helicopter . You can t possibly know it s like to fly a helicopter . I have three helicopters . I have a slept in months . Like , no . On something fundamentally wrong , you just know . </s> <s> You have to have experience to be right . You just need to be right . Thanks one person . Even at home , during the special , they re going to be like , that was only one person . The rest of the room did not agree enough to a pilot . But that one person was like , I m going to make a stand . You were right . When something s fundamentally wrong , you just know . Like , when I see toddlers in tiaras , I know . You ve never seen the show . Here s a brief synopsis . That s the whole tassitude , so hang on . I m going to have to go back to the hotel . I m going to have to go back to the hotel . I m going to have to go back to the hotel . I m going to have to go back to the hotel . R siempre . Where is your ? You have to rehearse . Pross tietutes , any astringent , How about . . . Hoşgう . Like what are we waiting for ? It is abuse . No child has ever asked for that . Like no three year old kid has ever just looked up with their mother longingly and said , Mommy , dress me like a whore . Oh . No . She says , Mommy , dress me like a princess . You re a princess . I don t know , mom . I don t know . Looks a little horrid . Hey , you got anything back there in a one piece ? I m a baby . I met these kids , Mom . I just realized that that sounded . . . Don t think I intended to , please . I don t know when watching this thing s like , oh , no , that sounds about right . I just finished the gig in Miami , had a flat of Seattle for the next night . I m on a sleep for seven hours . And that s not what life had for me . Because I boarded the plane . And half that plane was filled with passion girls and their mothers . I was looking around that plane going , holy shit . I d rather snics . Get these motherfucking totsies off my motherfucking plane , right ? One of the mothers sits down right next to me . And she starts to talk to me , which she thinks is her right to do as the person who bought a ticket in my rug . You know what ? And I don t want to talk to her . Because I have this condition that makes it difficult for me when I m interacting with strangers . I have this thing where I m honest . That gets me to a lot of trouble . I don t think I can be honest on a seven hour plane ride with a woman from Totha , who s in Tiers . </s> <s> I m not making a lift off . Like , you understand ? This is right away like , hi , what s your name ? You re anything wrong with America ? Like how ? I m not gonna swallow that . So I m doing everything I can to act distracted so she won t talk to me . I m staring at the inflame magazine for an hour and a half . There s really this adogra like , oh , there are a lot of sevens in this particular puzzle . Like , whatever I can do , I m reading Skimal . That s how bad this shit got . I was reading Skimal . Like , I m gonna be the asshole who buys something out with the sky . Like , oh , my pet needs a vote . Let s staircase . I should get this . And I just run out of things to do as she starts to talk to me . And she was dumb right away . Wasted no time . Like , she entered a contest . Her first question . So where are you going ? What I want to say was , Seattle , I think we all are . I m not gonna jump in Chicago . I know what your plan is . I will if you keep talking to me , I ll consider it . But I want to see this one through . I think he sticks to the landing . What the fuck do you mean ? Where am I going ? We go where he goes . Stop our hands . There s nothing we can do about this situation . We are powerless . He wants to go to Peru . Fuck it . We re going to Peru . Like , there s nothing we can do . It s not the local . I don t know how you think planes work . But I can t push the tape and get off at my stop . We go to Seattle and we stay there . No , it s connecting . If that s what you mean , no , it s connecting . You know how I know it s connecting . It s a flight for my amnesty out of . That s how I know . That s the longest flight in the country . Who the fuck flies for my amnesty out of and keeps going ? How shitty of a ticket when you have to have . To go for my amnesty out of like , Oh , I m just going to Orlando . I m going to New York . No ! We re all going to Seattle ! That s what I wanted to say . But it would be rude . So I have to swallow that and say , Seattle . Where are you going ? What a small world ! What are the odds that two people on a flight to Seattle with both big and one to Seattle ? </s> <s> People behind me think I m going to eat it now . But I got to keep it up . The next question was even dumber . Do you want to meet my kids ? Do I want to meet your kids ? Have I been actively sitting here ? Wish you would introduce me to your children . Like , what do I coach Penn State ? Like , I don t want to meet your kids . That one was too soon off . You re right . No , I should have said Syracuse . Anyway , I have to point . Does that don t want to meet your creepy , don t dress children ? But you can t say that . It would be rude . I just swallow it and say , I would love to meet your kids . And it was so obvious that she had given up on her own life to live through those kids just by what she named them . And that didn t pivot in that moment . There are two reasons to have kids and only two reasons ever . One is because you have enough love in your heart and in your home . You want to share that with another human being . That s beautiful . You want to share that with another human being . The other reason is because you failed at whatever you said after two . You walked round two . That s what this was . His kid s name was Megan . Megan . Not Megan . Megan . Me again . Oh my God . That name . Second one was even more appropriate . He was Vicki . I m like , oh , that s so pretty . Is that short for Victoria ? Or is that short for Vicarious ? That one I said I love because she didn t own a man . Vicarious , right ? Now the people behind me are laughing . They get it . She s just confused . Vicarious . Is that a Greek name ? No . Vicarious . That s a Greek name . That s derived from the root of the flight to Seattle s fucking long . Do you have any idea how bad your flight has to be ? Feed your root for your own plane to cry ? I don t mean like a fleeting thought , like every time I ve ever flown united . I mean like . . . I mean , the entire mental path of the thought from start to finish . Like the whole work problem . I would die . I don t want to die . They would die . I m gonna do it . Like have you ever had that at the end ? I don t know why they re on the plane at the beginning with terrorists or not allowed flight . TSA should have stopped them , right ? To take a one looking of kids outfits and like , nope , not allowed flight . TSA is supposed to protect us from the terrorists . When I said that , I giggled inside a little . The TSA is supposed to protect us from the terrorists . There were last defense against terrorism . Have any idea how dead we are ? They ve never stopped the terrorists not even one time . Not once , ever , never , never , ever . No time , never . Not any time . Count the time , since nothing . </s> <s> It s easy to count . No time . Some of you were not with me . So you know what ? It s TV . We can do this . I m gonna go to another bit . I m doing different bit . You ever been to the Department of Motor Vehicles ? Did you ever go to the DMV ? They worked for the TSA . You understand what the fuck I m saying ? They ve never stopped the terrorists ever . Three times the terrorists have been arrested at an airport since 9 11 . All three have got the security and arrested on the plane . Two of them were on the no fly list . You realize that means the no fly list , the no board list ? Aren t the sandblows . That s not possible . It doesn t make sense . You can board a plane if you re a terrorist . Just don t fly anywhere . That s where the danger comes in . Get on the plane . Be not for your take table up . Get the fuck off the plane ! You better leave before Wi Fi starts . Maybe I m being harsh . Who used to say how many plots they foiled that would have happened ? That would have been carried out . That would have involved a snow globe and four ounces of shampoo . That s real , by the way . Snow globe . Kind of an exaggeration . That s an actual band item . A snow globe . Read the list of things you can t wear on a plane . It s kind of badass until snow globe . I agree with all of them right up until snow globe . Grenade . Machete . Rocket launcher . Snow globe . Wait a minute . Snow globe . You re too cute for this , let s snow globe . Who is a dangerous weapon ? Who is a dangerous weapon ? You could take that on an airplane with a snow globe . I think we should let you . That s not a joke , I mean it . We should let you . You get us eventually . Why are we wasting our resources ? If you re that good , how are we gonna say ? Even if it s just walking to a cockpit and just go . And the pilot gets all distracted . Like , is that 18th century England ? No ! Fuck , he s back to controls ! Cause my love for souvenirs ! Understand that for that to be on the list of banned items , that have to happen in real life . Like one person doesn t just make that list . Like there had to have been a room full of people in charge of our safety . And one of them had to have said , What else is dangerous ? And someone else said , Out of house snow globe . And now it s said , Jerry , get the fuck out of the room . Nobody said that . Nobody said , I never should have hired you . I never should have hired you . Favour to my sister . Nobody said that . They put it on a picture , put it on a sign , and put it in the airport . </s> <s> And now we gotta deal with this ridiculous draconian security theater bullshit . We gotta give up our rights , our freedoms . They act their means to us all the time . And we do it cause we live in a war torn country , right ? But we don t . That s a weird part , huh ? We don t live in a war torn country . I mean , just stop acting like we do . We don t live in a war torn country . Here s how I know . I m on stage talking shit on a Saturday night in a pork city . That was wrong . In the convict club , circuit half gabby stands going smooth right now . Just gonna laugh a minute . Like , you ever come home and your wife and your kids have been killed ? Me too ! That s all I m talking about . Who s from out of town ? I am Infernal . That s the show . I was flying the first day they changed the rules . I was like , what does that big blue machine do ? Like , oh , well , that takes naked picture of you , though . What if I don t want that to happen ? Oh , then we re gonna grab your balls . Why are those my options ? I did it . Those are gonna come my only two options . I don t live in a world where every option involves my balls . And there s gotta be a non ball option . Maybe we should move further on the menu . Option three doesn t involve my balls . I don t think my balls are a matter of national security . I appreciate the compliment , but I don t think . . . You have anything to worry about ? I don t want them taking that picture . I don t want them looking at that picture . I don t want them laughing at the skeleton in the back with the weird looking dick . I don t want them laughing . And I m not saying I have a weird looking dick . I just don t know for sure . Like , mathematically , I haven t seen enough dicks of you . I haven t seen it . A lot of room is not a big enough sample size . I don t know if my dick is average . I don t know if there are three billion dicks in the world . A lot of room being a big enough sample size for the standard deviation of dick . Like , I don t know . There are three billion dicks in the world . To know for sure that you re a savage , you d have to see a billion and a half dicks . I haven t seen that many dicks . If you re just taking someone else s word for it , and if they ve seen a billion and a half dicks , wrong . </s> <s> Like , they just know . . . Drag us in that relationship . No one should see that many dicks . No business in the world would force you to see that many dicks . You could run a successful garage in practice . You wouldn t see that many dicks in a lifetime . There s no way . There are three billion dicks . You understand , for a billion and a half dicks , you d have to look at a dick in aros for 32 years . A dick every second . Thirty two years . I ve given this a great deal of thought . You have to look at a dick in aros for 32 years . If you re a whole life , just looking at pictures of dicks every day . Just dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick . No job , whatever make you . . . The TSA , and that s the one job . Complete job . Then you d be like , I do feel more secure . Thank you , America . I don t let them take that picture . They got rid of those machines , by the way . They got rid of the crystal clear naked machines . Now they just have like the scramble torn naked machines . They d also give you cancer . Straight up , yeah . Yeah , they give you cancer . And when I say that , I m not a crazy person . I m not a conspiracy theorist . They give you cancer . Here s how I know . There s been a 21 rise in cancer among the TSA . That s possible . That s coincidence . That s why they say it s coincidence . Just like the ghost and the mouth s perturbed . It s just coincidence . Their life s full of coincidence . It s positive . Like earlier today , I was hungry . Then I ate something . And now I m no longer home . Life s full of little coincidence . When I go through , I take it apart myself to inform them . Those machines are giving them cancer . Now I m not a dick about it . I m not just rubbing in their face . I m not like , you guys are gonna be the cancer . Now how the nice guy . I m like , good luck with your cancer . I mean , that s all I got . I m a sweetie . Opt out , please . The more of us that opt out , the more inconvenience they will be . The more likely they will get rid of this draconian security theater bullshit they are for tending keeps us safe . And we re out of town . And the cancer . They re gonna touch you a lot . DSA is a giant game of dick , dick goose . They touch you . No , they don t want to touch you anymore that you want to be touched . Use it . While you re waiting for them to come over , take some about 15 minutes because they re like a few to one . </s> <s> So while you re waiting , spend your tax dollars with every step . Here s what you do . You put your zipper down . It s important stuff . Zipper down . Creepy look on your face . Zipper down . And as you count every life , you re gonna go , oh , you re gonna go nice . If you still into it , you re like , where s it your turn γ ? You can have a rest me for enjoying myself . Someone asked me what I would do if it was a hot TSA agent . Yeah , what if that was the thing ? I really haven t prepared . I don t know what . . . What if it s a dragon ? I don t know . I don t know what I d do . I haven t decided yet . After the physical challenge , they will begin to ask you questions . These questions are designed to catch nobody . They re the easiest , most general questions for anybody who can answer with no ball points . I like answering them as literally as possible . Do my part to teach them to ask better questions . I just fly down , got a posi man alive . What are you traveling for ? I said , it s the quickest way to get in between places . In the past , I need to be in another place . I m fresh out of ideas . I m open to suggestion . He s getting frustrated and he goes , no , I m gonna . . . You fly somewhere for work . I said , I don t know how I d ever ask that . That s an unmanned because you said other words . Yes , I m flying somewhere for work . You said , what do you do ? I said , I work . I answered it that way for three reasons . One , teach them to ask better questions . Two , I don t want to tell them I m a stand up comedian . I ll fuck with them for two minutes . Three , I don t want to tell them . Any I don t want to stand up comedian ever . I said , when I do this , I don t talk about this . When you tell someone you re a stand up comedian , what do they say to you every single time ? Tell me a joke . Say something funny . Hey , but last , last monkey dance ! I can t do this . Just because I can do this doesn t mean I want to all the time . My choice . But I have to tell them what I do because you can t get through airport security unless you answer that riddles three . I told them I was a stand up comedian . It s exactly what I was afraid of . You have funny men ? Want you to tell me a joke ? When the airport security guy says , tell me a joke . Never say , well , here s a joke for you . </s> <s> Airport security . He didn t know what I meant , so I was alright . But he saw the people behind me laughing . So now he gets pissed off because don t get smart with me . Also against TSA regulations , I don t know if it s not allowed to be smart in the vicinity of an airport . I assured him I was only smart in comparison . And he didn t know what I meant . So I got to keep going . And I realized I got lucky that day . They were good in smart people and every profession . What if I picked the wrong guy on the wrong day ? Tell him you joke . Airport security . I got one for you . Cavity search . I don t like that joke . Face 45 minutes to tell and the punchline tickles . I like that joke . You don t understand . I fly like five days a week . I m putting 15 minutes on my special about how much I hate the TSA . This is going to go well for me . The most confusing thing about the TSA is they make those announcements that tell me not to tell jokes . They make those announcements , right ? They tell us all that we can t joke . Anything said , even ingest , really ingest why I have not gested an affordment . What the fuck ? Even ingest . Here s why they make that announcement so ridiculous so that we just talk about what the announcement says and not what it means . You know what that announcement means ? Scary as thought I could ever have ? An announcement means people in charge of our safety will get confused if you tell them to joke . They ll be able to decipher code in the language they ve never heard before . But if you get around with them , they ll fuck shit up . Go to the airport tomorrow . No , not . Who s there ? A terrorist ? Begot one ! Is that gonna happen ? I would like to tell jokes on my topic . What I want to ? I d like to be allowed to . When they say how many pounds is your bagway , how much fun would it be ? They say , I m sorry , but I only know the weight in kilo . You re international , you might not realize this . You re an American , you know , a kilo weighs your drug dealer . I got you . You re a real drug dealer . We re Los Angeles right now , so that s a cocaine joke . That is a great cocaine joke . This is gonna hair everywhere . Some people are gonna watch it and it ll become a meth joke . Transformers , it s not kind of a lie . I m glad there are no meth people here tonight . The awkward dern now last part . Some of you offended and you re like , they re not funny , man , they re not funny . Yeah , because we do too much meth , we lose your teeth . We just hilarious , because you need teeth to say the word meth . Then you can t get anymore . That s nature s intervention . </s> <s> Akuna Matata . Here s why you actually can t joke with them . This is the real reason . Because if you tell any jokes , they might actually have to act human . They re not allowed to act human . No , because it d be dangerous if the TSA treat us nicely . That s the only thing I could think of for why they re so mean . Why there s such dicks ? Because it s part of the job . They have to be such dicks that even the terrorists are like , fuck it , we re not gonna fly . No , they re not gonna fly . This is bullshit . I have dignity . I m bombatrain . Because people saw it . Spongebob . Spongebob . Spongebob . Spongebob . We go through all of this , all this indignity , so they could save our lives , right ? But we don t care . We don t care if we live or die . Or Americans . Look how we eat . We know everything there is to know about McDonald s . We re like , yeah , okay . Let s go go . Oh , you mean it s death every time ? Yeah , that s okay . That s good for the salty , right ? Salty , still salty . That makes all the bad . We fucking crazy . 3 , 000 Americans died in my 11 . 600 , 000 are killed by heart disease every year . So if 9 , 000 have been every other day for an entire year , it would not equal the people killed by heart disease . But look at the way we live . And we go through airport security . We go through all of this , all this indignity , give them all the power in the world . We take off our belt and our shoes , and then they yell at us to take our belt and our shoes off . And while we re holding our belt and our shoes . As if we just bring extra all the time . And we have to take our belts with me and our shoes . Or we re going to have to have kids . Take our lots of animal bags . So important . So carry mount to our safety . Take the laptop out of the bag . And the bag gets a bomb and out of the bag . Just a laptop ! Hey , stop , stop , stop , stop ! Everybody ! Look at that laptop ! Look at that laptop ! Look at it ! It s just a laptop ! Don t turn it on or anything . Just look at it ! Just a laptop ! Or a bomb ! Shit ! Like a laptop ! Or those two things ! Terrorists would never think of doing that though . Right ? I wonder if the fucking comic did . But a terrorist would ever have left home unless he watched the Special Line feeling incredibly guilty . Take our shampoo out . Our tiny , comically sized shampoo out of the bag . </s> <s> Got to take a little tea . Shampoo is out of the bag . Got to take it . You ve got to put it in first of all . Put it in a clear plastic bag . Because they don t have x ray technology . They re x ray . So , they have to put it in a clear plastic bag . So , they can see it . Because unless it s a clear x ray , it can t see it . So , you have to take it . And it s tiny little shampoo . Three ounces each . Do not bring four ounces . Fucking terrorists . Do not bring four ounces . Two people can fly with three ounces each . You can buy them and make six ounces . But if they re not , they re not . Two people can fly with three ounces each . You can buy them and make six ounces . But if one person flies with four ounces , he s going to kill us . That guy s going to kill us . If he s bald , okay , yeah . That guy , I have a bald guy fly with that much shampoo . Sump s up . Sump s up . Let s see his very clean balls . And we can see that on the scanners . That s a good amount of part two . What happens if you break too much liquid ? What do they do ? Take it and they throw it away because it could be a bomb . It could be a bomb . So , they throw it away . It could be a bomb . So , they throw it away . It could be a bomb . So , they throw it away . The garbage can . Right ? Fuck next to them . Because it could be a bomb . Just the kids at the bottom . They put a next in them . In the garbage can with all the other possible bombs . In the area where it s the most amount of people are you fucking kidding me . You fucking kidding me . Keep us safe . And then they yell at us to go quicker . That s the ultimate indignity . We re gathering up all our stuff and they yell at us to hurry . I m like , I was dressed when I got here . I would have just walked right through . This was a long saw . And yet , we go through that all . Pack up all our stuff . We take a left . And we walk in and we don t . The fuck is wrong ? We re okay with dead that you should just be really salty . We re like a salt bomb . We re like a salt bomb . We re like a salt bomb . We re being . . . We re being watered , but we d be happy . We don t even want to pay for a healthcare in this country . We re still arguing about that . Every civilized country in this world has healthcare . Except for us , the bill that we ve passed is the water down compromised . It doesn t even help a lot of people . </s> <s> We re still arguing about the shit today . It s amazing that we wouldn t want to pay for healthcare . Every other civilized country in the world has healthcare . But we don t want any . We don t want any . We ll pay for fake mall cops in the airport to keep us alive . We ll pay doctors to actually diagnose what s killing us . So here s my belief . We re going to get healthcare . Every one of us doesn t matter how poor you are . It doesn t matter if you are a pre existing condition . It doesn t matter where you are from . We re all going to get healthcare . It s just going to have to be at the airport . Like what is happening ? At the airport . That s right . You re going to be by the balls . I m going to turn . I m going to cough . You tell me you re going to have an out of hernia . I think that s fair . There s an X ray behind you . Let s do this , shit man . Want me to find a new , clear plastic bag ? Would I help you ? Did I understand ? A lot of people are watching this . You get political . You can be divisive . I understand that . I don t want to divide anybody . We re all here to get along . Happy family . So I m just going to do the next 10 or 15 minutes about gay marriage . Don t cheer . You don t know which side I m on yet . Yes , we do . So . . . It s gonna be realistic . I can read . So . . . I actually had an interesting circumstance this summer . My cousin came out . 13 year old cousin came out . He was only 13 . He came out . He s a roadman s Facebook hero . Hey , everyone . I m gay . And I was at the end of it . I was like , three years , but I called him out . And I was like , I m so proud of you , man . Because he doesn t have to spend the next five to 10 years of his life pretending to be something he s not , and ashamed of who he really is . And then he hit me . Maybe he didn t come out . Maybe his friends were just fucking with his Facebook . Like , that s . . . He s 13 years old . That s totally possible . If you re 13 , you leave your Facebook open at a friend s house immediately . You need to go , hey , everyone , I m gay . And then your creepy cousin calls you and goes , I m proud of you . </s> <s> That s not what happened . That s what would happen . That s what didn t happen . That s not what happened . That s not what happened . You really didn t come out . And I was really proud of him . I think it was awesome . I ve always been a supporter of gay rights for a very specific reason . They might not know about me . It s a very specific reason , because I am not a complete fucking asshole . And I feel like you have to be . . . So look , another human being in the face and say , you and guests many races I do , go fuck yourself . Yeah ! Not each other . Just yourself . Not even yourself . There s a dick and you be careful with those . I say there s a dick , even though this law is predestined against men and women all the same . It s because of men that it s happening . It s because there are politicians who are afraid of penises . I don t know , weird thought , but that s why this has happened . That there s someone who can t visit their dying love in the hospital because there s a center in Washington going , Dicks , you re 18 ! Like is that ? How mature are you ? Like , I don t understand . And that is what s happening , because there are people who are against gay marriage who will watch Lesbian porn . That is some hypocritical shit . Watch Lesbian porn if you re against gay marriage . You have a threesome , you can t have a threesome . That s gateway fuck . You can t risk that . That s a slippery slope . By the way , slippery slope . Excellent name for a lesbian porn . But my point . Well , two enthusiastic sir , my point . You can t blame it on a religion . You re not a traditionalist . You re a big . Like , it s as simple as that . You can t blame religion for your intolerance . That s ridiculous . Like intolerance , oppressive laws start to go away when it becomes inconvenient for the ruling class . That s how life works . Like , back in the day , women could not get remarried when their husband died . That was a law . And then , a really hot woman s husband died . And shit started changing . People were like , this is dumb law . We didn t think this one through . We about think this one through . And then women got the right to vote . And there was some other shit in between , especially only an hour , I got a cup of corners . So , people blame it on tradition . That s ridiculous . The CEO of Chick fil A did that . He said he believes in traditional marriage when one man and one woman . And I was watching this going , you are so ignorant . You don t even know what traditional marriage means . </s> <s> Go back further . Traditional marriage between one man , a couple of women , some goats , and some other shit . That was tradition . And then we evolved . You can t just hold on to shit because it used to happen . We learned , we evolved . What if he just owned slaves ? Would we have to be okay with it ? The CEO of Chick fil A was just like , I had just owned slaves because I m a traditionalist . Tradition ? Like you think I would have it ? It would never happen . The CEO of Chick fil A is not culture enough to quote Fiddler . My point is that that guy should not be allowed to tell me where we re not , I can stick my dick . Yeah . Unless he s just like , not in the chicken . All right . You put that on the window . I ll know for next time . I m going to this woman embarrassing incident . I was driving through Eastern Kentucky on 2004 . The day that a lot of states banned gay marriage , including Kentucky . And I stopped at a gas station overnight . There was a little gas station attendant working there . And if you re wondering what he looked like , you re correct . So I walk in and it comes across a TV of a banned gay marriage . And he says , It s about damn time ! Really ? Been waiting a while for this . Some you didn t hear of , some someone mentioned it on the news a month ago . But you didn t ? It s 2004 in Eastern Kentucky . He didn t know anything yet . This before Glee was on the air . Like this was a long time ago . And I can t see injustice and not say something about it . And one day that will get me killed , not that day . Spoiler alert . But I walk up to him and I say , You know you voting on whether or not gay people get married is the equivalent of you voting on whether or not you need to fishing licenses in Nevada . And he goes , I don t fish in Nevada . I m like , I know you don t fit ! Well , I don t even tell him to this guy . It s like pulling a tooth . I don t even tell him to this guy . That was my favorite joke . Right there , those . That was gold . That was gold . Not the joke , too . I m about to rip this guy to shreds . And I realize something . I don t actually know why he s against gay marriage . I mean , I m pretty sure I know , based on what he looks like and where he s from . I m prejudice . I m the prejudice one of that conversation . So I apologize to him and I said , You know what , man ? I m sorry , I jumped to conclusions . I just , You can have your opinion . I can have mine . It doesn t make either one of us a bad person just means we disagree . </s> <s> And he says , I just think a man having sex with another man is disgusting . And I couldn t disagree with that . I also think that s disgusting . But I think a lot of people have sex with disgusting . I think too fat people have sex with disgusting . I think too really skinny people have sex with disgusting . I like a creepy way , you know ? I think one fat person , one skinny person , is disgusting and dangerous . Like , I don t think , at least judge our politics based on who we want to see fuck . That s a strange world . A lot of people , I don t want to fuck . Have you been in the world ? Have you seen people ? He gets , I don t want to watch a fuck and that s not why I vote . Like , I don t understand the logical connection between , I don t walk from life to on , no , no , no , no , no , no . I don t even go register at Macy s . Like , how the fuck is that ? He s part of it . He s a tradition . Like , I don t understand . And it kills me when I see other people s prejudice because I don t know what I m saying . I don t know what I m saying . And it kills me when I see other people s prejudice become my laws . Like , that s not a world I want to live in . I saw a state senator on the week from Louisiana . He was technically on Louisiana at the time . I saw a state senator from Louisiana on television on CNN , complaining about immigrants . And his dude s got 10 kids and he starts complaining that immigrants are drain and are resources . And the reason why his kids don t get the resources they need are because of immigrants . And I m watching this losing my damn mind . You have 10 kids . You re a drain on our resources . You smoking into America every nine damn months . How do you think that works ? No one has ever suggested electrified fence around your wife s vagina . No one s ever suggested that except for me just now . I suggest it , just now . But it would be difficult to build all the tiny fences . How are we going to do ? It s a job creator . That s positive , right ? I m going to run for office on the vagina fence replafor . By the way , the vagina fence replafor . I m named by my band playing here Tuesday . So we ve built this ethos in this country that be fruitful and multiply without addressing the repercussions of that . Like , we should , it s not just about having as many kids as possible . </s> <s> But we glorify that . Like 19 accounting . That show you , we ll see that show . 19 accounting . We ve got 19 kids . 19 kids . How do you have so many kids that you could have a softball team play your other softball team ? And the last kid could umpire . Like , how do you have a leave ? She was going to have a 20th and then she miscarried . That s really sad , by the way . That s really sad . I hope no one ever has to deal with that . I hope no one ever had to or has to . I hope you don t . But her . I would have spiritual crossroads in my life . I don t know if I believe in God or not . I m at that point in my life where I ve been questioning things and I m just really not sure . But that s the best proof of God I ve ever seen . That s the argument right there . I wouldn t believe in God if it weren t for that argument . Because she went on TV the week before to say , my children are a gift from God . That God said , it s not your own . The first dozen were gifts . Yeah , that s right . And then you started stealing shit . You ve been running through the kid aisle like you re on supermarket sweeps . It s gone too far . It has gone too far . We re supposed to build houses for these people . Extreme home make room . That show that makes an entire community donate their money . Donate their time , their resources . Build houses for people . Couldn t learn when to stop fucking . Yeah , look , if you need a house because you gave your money to charity or there was an ethical disaster or someone you re family got sick or you just can t find a job . These are all wonderful reasons to be poor . But if you re poor just because you have nine kids , how do I say this ? Nice . Die . You had nine kids . You re asking us for help . You had nine . You weren t ballin with eight kids . Had a knife with like this last kid . It s a lot . Like that s not what happened . You could not afford to feed your family and you were irresponsible enough to build more family . You knew that sex could do that . You ve seen it happen eight damn times . You weren t surprised . Like , yeah , it s magic . Like , no , you knew . How those people got here ? Like , you knew . That s why there are so many dumb people in this world because it takes an educated person to stop the process . Say , you know something , maybe we can t afford to raise a child . Maybe we can t afford the time it takes to raise a human being . Maybe we cannot afford the love it takes to raise a human being . </s> <s> And then a dumb person just goes , this goes and that . And it makes a people s . And it happens again . And again . And again . And again . And there s never any fucking parking . Like , how ? Do you even have sex when you ve already had eight children ? Logistically . Like , I have so many questions . Like , how ? What do you find time ? Or the energy ? Or the space ? Or the will to be attracted to a thing again ? How do you never get turned on when you ve already had eight children ? How is that possible ? What happens to your wife walks by ? Even , even really good . So that s because we re really poor . Lots of a lot of weight . I haven t eaten in a while . Whatever it is , come here . I m going to fuck you till we re homeless . Like , how do you ? Again . That s what it s like . The KFC family meal does a feed nine kids . What does that say about your wife ? The KFC booksy Euger s wouldn t even want to help her . They don t make enough chicken to understand . They don t make enough chicken . You re fucking faster than chicken . Hey , food , and something called a bucket and it wasn t big enough for you . Would you like your new chicken suitcase ? Well , that help you . It s a matter of time before they make that product . KFC s new chicken suitcase . Don t stick your dick in the chicken . Don t stick your dick in the chicken . That s my jazz band . We play Wednesdays . We were warned as children about this behavior . about this behavior . When we were kids , there wasn t all lady that lived in a shoe . So many kids didn t know what to do . I know what to do . It s not fucking , you live in a shoe . You live in a shoe . A shoe . A shoe . How bad does it like me to get before your wake up call ? You live in a shoe . And that s not rock bottom . A shoe . That s not in a boot . That s a duplex in the shoe world . They had to shoe . That s a step for roller skating . It s a trailer in the shoe world . And who s ? Daggerussian , who s fucking woman in the shoe ? I don t know that answer . They don t address that in the nursing room . Gentlemen , I don t care how long it s been . I don t care how long it s been since you ve had sex . You go out one night , give me the lady . She says , come back to my place . And you say , yes , in her place is a shoe . You call that shoe ? Take the call , come home . I ll just fucking the laces . No , don t fucking the laces . That s my friend s man , playing with those hands . Anyway . It bothers my mind that we build houses for these people . And our extremo mego , where some of the people aren t even poor on the show , they were just lying . </s> <s> They wanted money for their business . 10 of the people on that show look it up . No one questioned it . What s the fact checking process like over there , you see ? Hey , will you build me a house ? Yeah , yeah . But where do you live ? In this empty field with these blueprints ? Yeah , let s get the whole community involved . Let s go to a certain time . The story checks out . Even when the show gets it right , they build these houses based on one little detail the kids life . If you ve seen the show you re not going to talk about , it s ridiculous . They re like , hey , Billy , what do you like ? I like race car . You re going to sleep in a race car . Why ? I said I like race cars . I figured you might show me one , and I had a million of things . And you d make me be a race car . As long as you , why would you extrapolate to the fact that I wanted to live around race cars the rest of my day ? In my life , I m six . I like a different thing tomorrow . What the fuck is wrong with you ? I m lucky . My sister sneezed in front of you . Now she sleeps in a tissue box . What the fuck is wrong with you ? All right , on that show , would have said something stupid . We all would have said something stupid . Kids ? They were like , hey , Steve , what do you like ? I m going to like , I m a men s fan . I love Keith Hernandez . And my glenky would have been a mustache . I m almost supposed to do it that the rest of my life . Bring a girl along for the first time . Good luck . Good luck . Hey , this is my room . This is your what the fuck is wrong with you . Oh , I was hoping you had seen that episode . I was on this reality show a bunch of years ago . And they re like , what do you like ? And I was like , Keith Hernandez . And the world turned into Keith Hernandez . And I realized , that would be the single most important question I was ever asked my entire life . I probably would have thought about it a little more , said something smarter . What do you like ? I don t know . Comfortable , betting , and sensible decoration ? I would have said something smarter . But I said , Keith Hernandez . Now the world turned into Keith Hernandez . And it s never going to change . It s going to be Keith Hernandez the rest of my life . No one s ever going to buy this house . Who s going to buy this house ? No one s going to buy this house . My mother got off her job across country . Couldn t take the job . Because we couldn t sell the house . No one s ever going to buy this ridiculous house . We had one bar briefly . It was Keith Hernandez . Now that didn t work out . So you got traded . </s> <s> So now I m stuck here . My blanket is a mustache . My desk here is a gadget mitt . It was especially stupid . Just Keith Hernandez was the first basement . But ABC has a fact check . So now I m sitting at gadget mitt . So is that why your whole room smells like Vaseline ? I m like , yes . Let these shows . These kids , those are the solutions to our subordinates . All the ignorance in this world . It s going to come from television . It comes from children . You ever see that show where you re smart enough fifth grader , do you know that show ? Yeah . I call it by its real name , to catch a predator . You guys what we need . We can buy the two shows .

That sounds whatever , but I mean a day where I get to find out , like because , and this is why it should be harassment day , because women get to be inappropriate sex , really , all the time . You get to be inappropriate . And when I m saying inappropriate , I mean , say hello to me to close . Hi . Mm mm . Mm mm . Or some weird massage , because you think we re friends , and you re spawning , little kiss , and you re just like , oh , oh , boy , oh , boy , boy , boy , boy . And you re thinking , yeah , man , I wonder if I want to go , I don t know . Well , harassment day allows you to be able to ask . All year , I say the Tuesday before Thanksgiving . LAUGHTER And it s a beautiful day . Flowers and everything . You buy flowers . You just real cool . You walk up . You re respectful . You say , hey , how are you ? You know , afternoon , too .

And they re out of control , and I m not really a seasonal alarm understander . I try with what is , but I got a Westie , a little Westie and a poodle . I love my dogs , man . And I let them go to bathroom on the wee wee pad in the house , man , I don t care . And everything s good when they do this , because they got a little baby . You know , when they eat , right ?

I m like , what are you doing ? Oh , come on , man , why would you do that ? It s just , I m dumb , I don t know . I go , go ahead , boy , come on , man . Everybody s happy . And then , like , cause when I was younger , this is how you train dogs . It was no , it was easy . You just put them down when they first kicked in the house and you just hide around the corner , you know ? And you just wait , you wait till they go to the bathroom when they re supposed to . And someone s crunch up and go to the bathroom , you got to wait till the first , and then you just run , motherfucker , whoah ! And you two shove his face in shit . Yeah , how s that feel ? Shitty face , you re face stinks . How s that ? Oh , man , what ? He s like what ? He shoved them out . And he started tapping , like , all right .

Meaning you are sexual . He wants to sleep with you , but just cause you are sexual . Don t mean I m sexual . Right ? Say anything with love . Just cause I m lovable . Doesn t mean that you re lovable too . You re just likeable to me . You didn t do for me what I did for you to feel that way . You understand what I m saying ? It s very simple .

I love it . This is a safety hazard . This is a problem . I like it . My friends , I am from Toronto . So many people are from Toronto or just are like , no that s a weird race from . Yeah . Guys , I m break . I m breaking my straight . I m so fucking cold . You re so good for coming here . So cold . And every time I say I m cold people are like , oh , come on , you re Canadian . I m fucking a human . That s what I am . You don t do that in other situations . I m starving . Come on , you re sommelier . It s so cold . It s a crazy place . This is like the biggest , the New York has the biggest egos in the world . No debate . I saw a homeless guy walking down the street being like , that drapes on . I saw that drapes on . Start from the bottom now I m here . Start from the bottom now my whole team fucking . I was like , where did you start , buddy ? I m like , you re Jersey . You got every right . Where s the camera that s filming this live television ? Everything . Everything ? It s Uncle Sam , but hipster style . This is like all of the extras from girls . Yes . In a denim start of the applause break . Ladies , in a denim . See , this is how believable it is . It s like where ? Fucking where ? I saw this untouched photo on Jennadelle . This time , this time , I mean , I ll read into things . But this is a sign that there s controversy in the apartment . There s like one dude that s like , you know , just right up the letters in pencil . And then the fucking asshole roommate was like , no , V is not like that . It s what the creel is . I m like Drew . Okay , I m gonna move this here because I m dynamic . They call me the Canadian Dame Cook , lesbian , Louise . Streets . I got married recently , guys . Thank you . But the one , when you get married , people will say , how s married life ? Everyone . How s married life . And same time , how s married life ? Like it s like a kinky inside joke . How s married life ? You guys fifting each other ? They know what they want me to say . What they want me to say is like , we finished Netflix . </s> <s> Which we did . We did do that . The point is like , really , married life is the same shit as dating . It s the same shit except now the exit door to your relationship is just seal tjet . It s like a new door that you ll look at sometimes . But there s a bouncer at a cover charge . It s really big . It s either 800 or half of everything you own . My in laws are mother and mother and mother . I m like , cool . From the South . Cool . Go to church every Sunday . Cool . They re probably getting cool . I m the first lesbian girlfriend in my wife s interviews . Can you imagine we have a dinner ? Why not ? That was for them . Like what they pictured to come to their house in Virginia that day . Just the first lesbian . I stole your daughter s heart . And I built a deck out front . I m like , cool . I should have known how it was gay so much sooner than I did . Everyone ? Right ? We all should have . Sometimes I m at an airport bar and I ll have a beer with the opposite of me . The opposite of me and it s secrets there . They re safe , secrets are safe . And they will always ask me like two beers and I ll be like , how did you know you were gay ? It s the opposite of me . It s like a fucking Southern ghost . The real answer . I wish there was like a definite like , well , my pubes came out and they were rainbow . But like the real the real answer is just like always and never . Like really gay shit happens to me but I would forget it immediately . It was like gay memento . So like I should have fucking like every time my friends suggest if we practice making out , I would suggest we also practice fingering . You guys want to be prepared or what ? That d be amazing . If I knew I was gay when I was a twin , you know amazing sleepovers would have been . True they re dare fucking dare . Same there as last week . Show me your tits everyone . Bring your mom down here . Let s play this game . I remember my friends would fall asleep during sleepovers and they were like , it s just smell they re hair . I was like either a lesbian or a murderer . I had a hard time coming up my dad s Muslim . So now he expects me to get like 10 wives . I wanted to come up to my extended family for so long that he was always like , oh come on , keep on secret hair . I m married now with her five year plan of the secret . I m going to keep on showing up to family things with like my what best friend again . She loves Ramadan . For you see who got like a little kid best friend . The better the world . Um guys , what chance are you going to want kids eventually ? Yeah . </s> <s> Eventually . I mean it keeps like any question . I feel like by the time someone like you ask kids , you ll be in like your late 60s . It s just practical as well . We both ate naps and neighbors . It kind of works if you did it that way . Later on kids , when I do have , because the only thing that s talked about being gay is like , the only way to have a baby that looks half like me and half like my wife , I need my brother s sperm . Cool ? Scientifically ? Are you a science person or is that it s just like your time like , science ? It s not . Okay . That was the best reaction though . I just did that joke just not to frack and ruin it . I put that joke stick in another audience of this project . And they did not say cool . It was in the Ever West side and they said , they acted like I spilled my brother s sperm on that . It s great . I asked my brother for it . It s super cash . How s your name ? I don t know how I feel about your future , I think , such a con . I m super angely . Follow me on Twitter , you young . Yes . I m super angely . I m super angely . Follow me on Twitter , you young .

You feel them all fucking pictures from them punches . Niggas , that s what Niggas is scared of . But that goes deep into , you know , we all got a responsibility , man . My father got killed when I was two years old . All my uncles and people that I grew up in my neighborhood was my male influences . And these Niggas was in the streets . So it s like , I thought that things was normal . That s not supposed to be normal . But the reality is , we got enough shit to worry about . Man , killing each other is some shit we should just let go . I m allergic to peanuts . I got to worry about a snick about killing me . I don t want to have to worry about you too , Niggas . I already got enough shit to worry about . Niggas , Niggas , throw a Reese s cup at me . I might be out of here . Now I got to worry about you shooting me because you man , I m doing what I was supposed to do in my life . Niggas , fuck . Bro . You did it , sir . You did it . It s serious . It s serious . I think about shit like that , because I didn t lost so many family members to the streets . My uncle Reggie got killed in 2002 . Got shot in broad daylight . George Avenue was watching the DC one of the busiest streets . Broad daylight . Hit him one time in the head and left him out there . You understand ? So I know what it feels like to fill that pain that we all fill in with Nipsy . And that s why I didn t like the fact that it happened like that because it put me back in a place where that shit is for me . I know what it felt like . You want to do something . But when you want to do something , the best thing to do is to try to prevent that from happening to somebody else that looked just like you . </s> <s> That s the best thing you can do .

And they used to it . They just dancing and hugging each other . But I m like , God , they all need some soap and water . And then check this out . Flip this . When they smell me with all my cologne on it , shit , guess what ? I stink . I stink . So me and this African dude is standing next to each other trying to figure out who in the hell is staking .

Millions and millions of flies . I think other flies from other countries go vacation in Africa . The biggest out of shape flies you have ever seen . They don t even fly . They were just walking on your table . When the last time you seen a fly , I have to take a run and start to get up in the air . I m going to be able to make it , man . I see y all over there .

And the music , the music , that s your heritage . Ain t no drum machines , no keyboards , no nothing . None of that . They just got it right in their heart , just right there , and they just beat on whatever . Boom , boom , boom , boom . They just do whatever they feel , and they let me know that they was up on our shit like when they were in the club . They played two pop . They played Biggie and everything like that . But at 1215 , they broke it down . They let me know where the music really started . At 1215 , they broke it down . At what ? 1215 , they broke it down . They broke it down . They broke it down . But they weren t worried about your social status and who you was with . </s> <s> They were just there to have good time . And all of a sudden they did this dance called Kuduru . That means tight ass . And one of the girls s music was getting hot . She took her rap , but she said , and she went out , and I said shit , and she slapped his with another gun . And I said , my mom must have cataracts . Ain t no way they moving their ass that fast . And then they looked up to me and they said , Jamie , you must dance . I said shit . Y all don t know who the fuck y all fucking with . I said shit . Now the most interesting thing in Africa was in safaris . Safari . You want to go ? You want to go ? You want to go ? Safari . Imagine being in a truck . But it ain t no bars or no ropes or nothing . You re holding you in . You just , you re sitting . You re just there . And then as a son went down , all of a sudden you hear sounds . You never heard before in your life like , what the fuck was that ? I m like , okay , what is that ? I don t see that in my pamphlet . We were supposed to go look at some geese or something you could pet . Because you know in America , you know your sounds . If you hear a rough , what s that ? That s a dog .

And the first time I saw a giraffe in the wild , I got horny . Because it looked like a woman . It had them long ass legs and the ass was all up in the air . You know what I m saying ? The ass was up and it just , you know , it just walking . I said , look at this fine ass giraffe bitch . I was fucked up . Shit . And you know I got them long , I ll ask you just looking at me . I said , you would have a giraffe baby in your ass if you keep . And the first time you see a water buffalo . Now water buffalo is the one with the horns and the hair in the middle . Now I swear maybe I was fucked up . But I swear he pulled out a comb and was it ? But the most notorious animal over there was what animal ? The lion . The lion because the lion didn t take no shit . He didn t run from shit because he was the shit . And all the other animals knew about it too . When the giraffe looked up and seen the lion , he was like , oh shit . </s> <s> The water buffalo was like , get my comb , get my comb , get my comb , play it .

But still filming . I am in the belly of the beast . Marissu Ellen I love you honey but that motherfucker jumped on me . That son of a bitch got me and here I am in the belly of the beast . Now the most interesting thing about the line is the sexual habits . Fellas we fuck right ? Fellas doing we fuck what the fuck ? Y all unix can t you hear me ? What ? 10 , 15 minutes ? Huh ? About that . The line fucks for 30 seconds . Every 17 minutes for 18 hours straight . Who s the motherfucker ? And the pussy must have been good too cause he couldn t stand that shit long .

Have you ever looked in his eyes ? Yeah . Once . Then whatever , I ve been fucking for two years . Hollywood was crazy . Movie pussy is different from TV pussy though .

Ladies . Could you leave some ladies for us please ? </s> <s> You know what I m talking about . Cut this shit out now . Now we started out in the 80s trying to get you all to do that shit now . Y all just in a long sharp mind . All the fellas in here tell you we wanted to have a monosha twa . Am I right ? I always want to have a monosha twistle . I did that shit . I ll never do it again . You know what ? I went to the playboy mansion . For one the playboy mansion was off the hook . All right . If you know anything about that , you go in there and it s all cons and stuff . You know how many of you in there trying to get some pussy ? The girls just pick them up and put them in the pussy and walk this . Thank you . And there s different little doors that you can go into and get your freak off . Right ? Get your freak off . So but you gotta be cool . You can t be too excited . Like the first time I went out , I was too excited . Hey , who fucking ? Get out . You know how you embarrass it . Knock the cool at your walk . Knock the cool at your walk .

        "transcript": "<s> Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome Ellen DeGeneres . Thank you all very much . I wish you all the best wishes ! Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you very much . Well , thanks . What a lovely way to start work . Thank you very much . I encourage you to do that for your co workers next time they walk in a work . Give them that because it s a lovely way to start your job . Thank you so much . What s great about this , you know , you think about it . We re a room full of people . Everybody is so different and we re all here for different reasons . Everybody has a different story . Some people are longtime fans and bought their tickets today . They went on sale and I m always appreciative . There they are , five of them . And yet look at the seats they get . That s a shame . Some of you had to get babysitters , especially if you have kids . Some people maybe you re in a bad mood . Maybe you had a fight with your boyfriend or your girlfriend or your husband or your wife or your lover or your partner or your roommate or your . . . Nice . The point is you re in a bad mood . Now I m going to have to work even harder to make you laugh all because you have to have things your way and you won t back down . But that s all right because we re all here and with all of our differences we all have one thing in common . We re all gay . Now there are people out there going . Do they think we re gay because we re here ? Do we look gay ? I told you this would happen . We re not going to understand a word of this . No , that s my one obligatory gay reference . I have to say something gay . Otherwise some people might leave here tonight going . She didn t do anything gay . She s not our leader . What happened to our leader ? Seriously though if you re here you re probably gay . You have tendencies , you ve thought about it . Now there are people going , I have thought about it . Is that mean I m gay ? Why not gay ? Is that how they get us ? Now I think the one thing we all have in common is that we all want to laugh and that is a beautiful thing . I m stalling . I have a problem with procrastination and I m supposed to start the show and I m not . I m supposed to do this procrastination thing . I ll do anything other than the one thing I m supposed to do . Then I feel bad about myself and I get depressed and I don t get anything done . I told a friend about this problem and she said you should go to therapy . I thought about it and I thought well wait a minute why should I pay a stranger to listen to me talk when I can get strangers to pay to listen to me talk ? That s when I came up with the idea of touring and I thought now I have to write a show . </s> <s> I thought what do I want to say ? What do I want to talk about ? I sat down on my desk and I was staring at my desk and I thought wow that s dusty . I can t write with my desk all dusty like this . I went downstairs to get a rag and on the way downstairs my kitten was on the stairway playing with a piece of dust or something . I did the thing where they roll on their back and show you the belly and you got to reward that . You can t pass that up . I sat down and I was petting the cat for about I don t know 45 minutes something like that . Then I went downstairs and by that time I d forgotten why I went downstairs and I was staring around trying to remember and I thought I should paint this room . I wonder what color this is . It looks like a white but I m sure there s some fancy name for it . All these people , what kind of job is that to come up with a name for paint colors ? All the different color whites like egg shell or linen or lily or off . All the different ones . I thought maybe yellow , canary or banana or smokers teeth . Something that would be . . . I thought I ve got it right . So maybe if I put music on it would be more inspiring . So I went over to the cabinet where I keep all my CDs . You should have seen that thing . Total disarray . Oh , everything . Meat loaf was next to the cranberries which I thought would be funny one night to organize it by food when I was drunk . Really nothing else was in there except bread . Just all kinds of weird . . . The doors and the carpenters and nine inch nails were together . And that doesn t help anything . So I thought I ve got to organize this . I can t put this off . And so I m sitting in the hundreds of CDs and the phone rang and it was a friend of mine . I said I can t talk . I m writing . And so . . . She said I can t believe you . You re so disciplined . I have such a problem with procrastination . And I said well we should go to lunch and talk about that . So we went to lunch and we were talking about procrastination and the waitress over her . And she said I have a problem with procrastination too . I said really ? Get my sandwich . And . . . So . . . But that s when it hit me . That s what I should talk about procrastination . That s a problem everybody has . That s universal procrastination . And then I said oh who I kidding . I m never going to get around to writing about procrastination . </s> <s> And so my friend said that s why I brought this videotape . If you watch this guy , he keeps your focus . He keeps you on track . You ll never procrastinate again . So about a week later I ll pop in the tape . I find that if you don t press play right away . . . Something s on TV . All the time . We have 700 channels now . When did this happen ? When I was a kid we have five channels . We didn t have remote . You had to hate something bad enough . . . To get up and walk that five feet to change the channel . Damn bananas and those horses are so much louder when they run . It was a simpler time back then . You know we were so easily entertained . We would watch anything . We would watch a flying nun . We d watch a talking horse . We are so much more sophisticated now . Watching people eat bugs and marry strangers for money . We have come a long way . It s enough to make you miss Mayberry , isn t it ? Oh , that was a great show . Man , the pace on that show . . . Nothing ever happened on that show . When there s time for whistling , there s a lot of time on a show . Everything was different . It was just slower and longer . Commercials were six minutes long telling us how delicious cigarettes and alcohol were . Man , those people were happy , smoking and drinking , weren t they ? People are still happy in commercials , but now they re concentrated in 30 seconds . They have to be happy in 30 seconds . And there s some happy people too . That woman in the shampoo commercial . . . She s happy . She s too happy . I fell for it though . I bought the shampoo . I got to tell you , I was shampooing for a good half hour , and I never got that happy . Finally , I just had to fake it , you know , because . . . I had to get out of the shower . It s amazing . 30 seconds when we get invested in those characters on the commercial . You know , that old man who can eat corn on the cob again ? I m happy for him . He couldn t eat it for a while . Now I can . That woman on jury duty , gotta go , gotta go , gotta go right now , gotta go , gotta go , gotta go . He gotta go ! In the judge doesn t understand . Such a relief by the end of that commercial . And I don t have to go right now . Fantastic lady . Those jingles are catchy . We retain that . In 30 seconds , we remember all this stuff , you know , because of the repetition . I believe that someday sitcoms will be 30 seconds long . Because that s all we ll need , and that s all our attention span can take . Because our attention span is shot . We ve all got attention deficit disorder , ADD , or OCD , or one of these disorders with three letters . </s> <s> Because we don t have the time and patience to pronounce the entire disorder . That should be disorder right there . TBD , too busy disorder . What s with the sudden choice of disorders that we ve got now ? You know , when I was a kid , we just had crazy people . That s all , just crazy people . All the commercials on television now are for antidepressants , for prosack , or paxle . And they get you right away . Are you sad ? Do you get stressed ? Do you have anxiety ? Yes . Yes , I have all those things . I m alive . I don t want to take a pill . Go to Africa . Go follow some bush man around . He s getting chased by a lion . That s stress . I m not going to find a pig me on paxle . I ll tell you that right now . It s watching the news the other day brought to you by paxle . Well , now I need it . Smart advertising . That s another thing , too . When I was a kid , the news was on once a day . Either caught it or you missed it . Now the news is on 24 hours a day . And that s not enough . They got a guy talking , and then there s a crawl down there . So you got that guy talking . You got the crawl going . You re online . You re putting in your opinion on your poll . No , I say to that . No . I said no , too . That s right . I said no . I said no . I said no . I said no . And then if you stop paying attention to the crawl , you go back to that guy for a minute , and then you go back to the crawl and you catch the end of something . Madonna s left foot . What about Madonna s left foot ? What happened ? You waitin for it to come back around again . Goes to commercial . Are you sad ? Do you get stressed ? There should just be one crawl that goes around over and over again . Things are getting worse . That s all we need . And the local news , man , they want you to watch every broadcast they ve got . Don t they ? It s not good enough you re watching the one you re watching . They do these teases to get you to watch later on . They re so incredibly cruel . It could be the most deadly thing in the world , and you may be having it for dinner . We ll tell you what it is tonight at 11 . Is it peace ? I feel sorry for the newscasters . You know , we can turn it off , but that s their job , and they have to read these stories , and they re just coming up on the teleprompter . They don t know what s coming up . </s> <s> And they ve got to go through this range of emotion that there were no survivors . And next , which candy bar helps you lose weight ? Still to come is an asteroid headed towards Earth . But first , we re to find the cheesy as pizza in town . Also a disturbing new study finds that studies are disturbing . It s like it s a frenetic by the end of the news , aren t they ? No wonder they snap when they start talking to the weatherman . You ve noticed it . It s everywhere . They go to some fantasy land when they start talking to the weatherman . And now let s go to Johnny with the weather . Johnny , when are you going to stop this rain and bring us some sunshine ? I ll stop the rain when you stop the car jacking s Colleen . The weather is actually the happiest part of the news , because at some point you re going to hear something positive . You re going to hear it s a beautiful day , or it s going to be a beautiful day . And it s nice to take in something positive , you know , because we hear all this negative stuff all the time . And we go out into the world and it s so chaotic . And we re not that we re going to notice if it s a beautiful day . We re moving too fast to even pay attention to that . And we need help to keep up with that pace . So we put a coffee in the air . And we re going to have a coffee . And we re going to have a coffee . And we re going to have a coffee . And we re going to have a coffee . And we re going to have a coffee . And we need help to keep up with that pace . So we put a coffee shop here . And there s a coffee shop here . And a coffee shop here . And a coffee shop here . And the smallest coffee is a tall . And I ll have a coffee in a side of Red Bull . Because I m very , very busy . I ve got TVD and I m late for yoga . Hurry , hurry . Hurry . Hurry . Hurry . Hurry . Hurry . Hurry . That we re trying to even do yoga is a joke , isn t it ? I mean , we re basically we re paying for silence . That s what we re doing with that time . We re paying for silence . I was in yoga the other day . And I m in full lotus position . And my shockers are all aligned . And my mind is all cleared . A bold chatter . And I m looking out on my third eye . And everything I m supposed to be doing . It s amazing what comes up when you sit in that silence . Mama keeps whites bright like the sun . The light . Mama s got the mat at the floor , rocks to . The time . The time . The time . The time . I can t stop that song . There is no silence . There s just constant noise all the time . </s> <s> And people are talking all the time . And even with all the talking , there s no communication . We re not , and even when we say , how are you ? We don t mean how are you ? We don t care . Just give us a fine or a good , a one syllable answer and move along . And don t even say pretty good . That s a follow up question . Pretty good , something happened . I don t have time . But we learn we re conditioned not to engage in full conversation . Because as soon as you start to talk to somebody , somebody s cell phone s going to go off immediately . property here we ll have a very good one of those questions about how to respond . Do we need legally ? Do we need legally ? Do we need legally ? Do did did did did did did did did did ? Do did did did did did did did did did did do ? What did we need so far ? What did we need so far ? What , what do you need ? Certainly don t have full conversations on cell phones . Usually the reception is so bad , but it s only bad on your side . The person talking to you has no clue . They re just rambling on and on . You ve got your finger jammed in your ear . You re shushing people on the street . You re duck behind a dumpster so you can hear about your friend s new haircut . What about the bangs ? Are they shorter ? Are the bangs shorter ? The bangs ! You re laughing . You re laughing . You re laughing . You re laughing . At least if they re static or something , you have a warning . You have an indication you re going to lose the call . You know , it s actually there s nothing worse than it being crystal clear reception . And you ve been rambling on for who knows how long , only to find out that it cut out who knows how long ago . You get , then you learn . You re scared to ever have a full conversation ever again . You stop yourself in between . Hey , so we were going to go to the cheese shop . Hello . And so we knew we were having white wine still there . All right . And I thought what kind of cheese would be best . At Illusion ? All right . And I like monster . Even if you re on a phone on , you know , at home , you re going to be interrupted by something , by call waiting , usually , which was invented as a convenience . But it s really turned into a many people s choice awards , hasn t it ? And you find out right away who wins or loses . You re having a pleasant conversation with what you think is a good friend . You hear the click . They tell you to hold on . You re confident they re going to come back to you . And then they come back and they say , I ve got to take this other call . </s> <s> You know what that means ? They just said to the other person , let me get rid of this other call . That s what you just became . You don t have to get the call way . You can let it go to voicemail . That s why we have voicemail to catch those calls that we miss . The voicemail that I like the best is the one where you insert your name into it . And then you end up sounding more like a robot than the robot . Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system . Ellen is not available . Is that how I say my name ? You know I d like to make reservations for dinner . There s four of us and the name is Ellen . All this wireless technology . We can talk to anybody anywhere , anytime . And we just take that for granted . You know , it wasn t that long ago that we had one phone in the house . Cord was just being invented back then . There was a shortage of cord . Maybe you had a foot or two from the wall to the phone . Back then when you said you were on the phone , you were on the phone . Then the kitchen wall phone came along , kind of an avocado or a mustard green . Usually that , a groovy color . There was a lot of cord . There was that 90 foot cord between the receipt . You could just walk all over the house talking on the phone . Clearing tables , wrapping around the dog . So by the time you hung up that phone , it just became this giant ball of cord confusion right there . But what was fun is every so often you d hold that cord and let the phone spin and find itself back again . Good times . We re losing the simple pleasures . We don t have that anymore . Now we have hands free phones so you can focus on the thing you re really supposed to be doing . You know chances are if you need both of your hands to do something , your brain should be in on it too . Just me . It s technology . We have all these buttons . You know speed dial , read all your program numbers in so you never have to remember them anymore . And so you don t . You know , use it or lose it . I m losing it . I just , I don t remember anything anymore because of the buttons that are remembering things for me . Have you ever forgotten what you were going to say as it s coming out of your mouth ? Hey , you know what ? What was I going to say ? What was I going to say ? We were talking about floor lamps . No . Mariah Carey ? No . Suddenly it s a 10 , 000 pyramid for these people . Things that taste like chicken . Things that monkey would wear . That s right . We were talking about tiny hats . That s bad . Yeah , when you forgot what you were going to say two words in , but what s worse than that is you forget what you were going to say after you ve been talking for a while . </s> <s> Whole bunch of people are sitting around talking about some subject matter , heated discussion . They all have opinions and you don t really and then suddenly you think , hey , maybe I do . So you jump in there and then you start thinking , it s a pretty good opinion . And when they hear this opinion , they re going to think she s smarter than I thought . And they re going to think about how smart she was . So you start congratulating yourself and because of celebrating too soon , you ve completely forgotten the point that you were trying to make . And you re still talking . Now they re looking at you like you don t know what you re talking about and you don t , but you can t let them know that . So you just keep talking , praying that the point will come back to you . So you start panicking because not only have you forgotten the point , you ve completely forgotten the subject matter that anybody was talking about . So now you really start panicking . You start sweating . You have to loosen your tie if you re a man or Diane Keaton or Avril Lavigne . And then you just try to get out of it by saying any generic statement that comes to mind . You know , well , six a one half a dozen of the other . It s a slippery slope , my friend . Teach you man to fish and there s no eye in team . It s technology . It s hurtness , I say . I blame the microwave for most of our problems . Anything that gets that hot without fire , that s from the devil . You know , believe me , you put a hot pocket in there for three or four minutes , pop that thing in your mouth . If that s not hell , ladies and gentlemen , I don t know what is . We re lazy . We have buttons doing everything for it . There s no physical activity attached to anything anymore . Even the garage door opener . We used to have to get out of the car and open up the garage door . Now there s a button you push , you know . And the car window , this became too much , I don t want to churn butter , I just want fresh air . We still use that gesture if we want somebody to roll their window down a traffic . We still use that , even though nobody s got it . Because we d look like idiots if we did this . We re lazy . Even we used to have breathments . Now we have breath strips . They just dissolve on our tongue for us . How lazy , can we not suck anymore ? I m tired . I have a hot day . We re lazy . We re on the go . We ve got food on the go . We ve got gogret . Yogret for people who are not in the car . We re lazy . We re on the go . </s> <s> We ve got food on the go . We ve got gogret . Yogret for people on the go . Was there a big mobility problem with yogurt before ? How time consuming was it really ? Hello ? Oh , hi Tom . Oh , I ve been dying to see that movie . No , I just opened up some yogurt . I am in for the night . Not even later . It s the kind with the fruit on the bottom . Well , thanks anyway . Have fun . That s a shame . And where are we going that there won t be food when we get there ? This food everywhere . We ve got an abundance of food . We ve got all you can eat places . We don t need to be eating all we can eat . We re not bears . We re not hybrinating . We ll be back tomorrow night to eat the same amount of stuff . And only in the darkness of a movie theater do we not feel guilty about eating a three pound box of snow caps . We stock up on popcorn and candy like we re crossing the sear , don t we ? You have any vinescent or hard tack or anything like that ? All right , I ll have a couple of soft pretzels , a hot dog , milk duds , jujubes . Is that the largest popcorn that bucket ? You don t have a barrel or anything like that . You have a donkey or a pack mule or anything ? I want a diet coke . And something about the darkness , we just lose all of our inhibitions in the darkness . Is the popcorn really that delicious ? We must shovel handfuls of it into our mouth . Oh , man , that s fantastic . I don t have time or travel or anything , However , Can you guys have a try ? Brand new movie , first day it s opened , you re there together in the entire time they re sitting there . Where s she going ? Why do you do that ? Is he mad at her ? I don t know , let s watch and find out together , shall we ? You know who you are . You re denying it right now , I do not do that . Why is she saying that ? What s she going to say next ? Then you have these people sitting behind you , they have that nervous foot just vibrates the whole time and it finds this way to the back of your chair . You want to turn around and say please stop it , but you don t . This is how we try to get that point across . Don t they know the international signal for that s irritating ? Or you have these people if you have the rocking chair seats they need to eat . They re not going to be able to eat . They re not going to be able to eat . Don t they know the international signal for that s irritating ? Or you have these people if you have the rocking chair seats they need to use your seat back as leverage to get up out of their seat behind you . </s> <s> You just go flying back for a second there . Feel like you re going to get catapulted out of there for a second . No acknowledgement , no I m sorry , no nothing . They re just walking away with chunks of your weave in their hand . People aren t as considerate as they used to be I find . I wouldn t mind hearing a few more please and thank you . That wouldn t hurt anybody would it ? You never hold the door open for somebody and they just waltz right through there . No eye contact , no thank you , no nothing . You re just standing there . Well you re welcome , you re majesty . Sorry I didn t sprinkle rose petals for you . Then you just meant to hold it for that one person . Suddenly it s like a clown car let out . You re just standing there three and four a second or six . Nobody will take it from you . You ve never been running for an elevator and there s somebody in there and they see you running . They just stand there . Like they don t want you to make it . It s awkward when you do make it , isn t it ? I m not going to make it . I m not going to make it . It s awkward when you do make it , isn t it ? You didn t think I d make it did you ? Well I did . If somebody is running for the elevator I m going to try to hold the door . I m going to stick my arm out until it s too risky . I m not going to do it when it s risky . And then sometimes if it s an elevator you haven t been in you can t find the panel of the higher glyphics of arrows of which one to pull . I m going to push but I m going to let them as the doors are closing . I did all I could . We want to be in there by ourselves . That s nothing wrong with admitting that . You know , it s a tiny little space close proximity to a stranger . It s silent . That s awkward . I always try to break that silence by saying something . First day of parole . Or hey , want to smell something weird . What s funny to me is you won t say that but you ll think about it when you re in there with somebody and then you ll laugh and then they ll wonder why you re laughing . The elevator is a convenience and a mode of transportation . I m all for . Takes you up high , fast , fantastic . But there are certain modes of transportation that come along with . That moving sidewalk and the airport . You know , I could see if you get in the airport and get on the thing and it takes you right to the gate then that s convenient . You know , but it s not . It s just in the middle of nowhere , one little section of the airport . Like a little ride in the middle of nowhere . What s that serving ? What s that ? I mean , it s fun because it s moving . So if you re moving while you re like the bionic woman , you re flying past people on the ground . </s> <s> The hard thing is adjusting to walking again once you get off . Kind of find your pace . What about those people who get on there and then they just stand on there ? What s that about ? Thank God they re on there . I don t know how they get anywhere . You think with all these things that are speeding things up for us and moving us along that we d get places earlier at least on time . You still have those people that are late all the time . You know , it s one thing if you re late once in a while , but these people that are consistently late , they always have the same excuse . Sorry , traffic . Really ? How do you think I got here helicoptered in ? If you re not allowed for it , then they get all defensive . Sorry . And when they say it like that , they don t mean it . Not when it goes up in the middle like that . Sorry , that s not sorry . That s like those people who say something like insulting and then they end it with just kidding like that erases it somehow . Hey , did you get a haircut ? Hope you didn t pay for that thing . I m just kidding . And then you don t know how to kid properly . Because we should both be laughing . I find a lot of people don t know how to kid properly . People don t understand the definition of kidding . You tell somebody something sad that my dog of 17 years just died . You re kidding . Funny as that is , I m not . People always say things they don t mean . People who say the worst thing , the paper cut , that s the worst thing . Is it really ? What about pickle juice in your eye ? That s pretty bad too , isn t it ? You ever had pickle juice in your eye ? Boy , those pickle jars , have you tried to open them lately ? They re vacuum sealed . You can t open those jars . There was a time , there was a big old barrel in a general store , you d roll up your sleeve and dip in there for a big old deal . Those days are gone . Now they re all in the jars and they re vacuum sealed . You re trying to open them and you cannot get them squatting helps sometimes . That s actually . . . And you always have that one person in the kitchen . Give it , I got it . Give it , I got it . I got it . Give it , I got it . I got it . Determine to get it . Then you finally hand it over and they just pop it right off . Well , I loosened it . And then once you get the lid off , that s where the danger of the pickle juice in the eye comes along . Because the juice is to the top . They re not kidding around with that juice , are they ? And the pickles are packed in there like . . . I wish they packed potato chips the way they packed pickles . Right ? It s all air . </s> <s> There s just six potato chips once you get the thing open . Pickles are packed in there like sardines . Which , by the way , if you ve opened up or not packed as tightly as pickles ? That expression should change . So , now . . . Now you ve got to get the pickle out of there , right ? And they re packed in there like pickles . It ll catch on . And so then . . . You need help and you re looking for that little stem that s still attached to dried . . . Little dill handle , if you will . Ever so gently you try to lift . . . And it comes off and you knew it would , but you try . So then you have to go into the pickle claw . And the pickle claw . . . You know it , you know it well . It s the same claw . It s upside down as the claw to get the Spirit toilet paper roll that hasn t dropped yet . That s the same claw . Notice , next time . Toilet paper claw . Pickle claw . Then once you get the pickle out of there , just pickle juice in your eye . And I m not saying it s the worst thing . I m just saying it s bad . The worst thing is trying to get into a brand new CD . Am I right ? What has happened with the packaging of CDs ? Are they angry , angry people , these CD packages ? Open here , is that sarcasm ? Are they mocking me ? Open here . And it s sealed with plastic . I ve never seen this thick , thick government plastic . I ve never seen it that thick before . Civilians can t buy it . And it s like , are they trying to keep it fresh ? Why is it sealed in plastic ? You can t get into it , so you re just slashing with scissors or a knife . That s how you have to get into anything now . Scissors are all the packaging now . It s like that . Have you tried to buy scissors ? You need scissors to get into scissors . What if you re buying them for the first time ? How are you supposed to get in there ? Batteries are packaged like they never want you to get in there . Thick , laminated plastic and thick cardboard and staples like from a staple gun . And what could happen to batteries ? And then try to buy a light bulb , thin , thin , thin cardboard . Open on both ends . What do they think ? Oh , they ll be fine . Everything s all different now . The packaging , the way you open things , toilet paper . Have you tried to get into a public restroom and the toilet paper hasn t gotten started yet ? </s> <s> You re the first one there and you ve got to find the start of it . You start out slow at first . Surely I ve gone around once or twice . Then you go fast . Maybe the wind will open the flap . Maybe I m going the wrong way . Then back to this way again . And then finally you find it and it s glued down . They re glue in the first flap down . Why ? So now you re trying to lift it and only a quarter of an inch comes unglued . The rest stays glued . So now you re pulling and you ve got a five foot long quarter of an inch strip that you just keep pulling . I don t want a streamer . I want toilet paper . No time to celebrate . Then you re trying to get it started . There s a groove out of one side and the whole rest is fully intact . So then you just shove your finger across , wasting most of the role trying to start at a new , which never goes evenly . Then you just start clawing at it like a wild animal . Jesus , I just want toilet paper . God . What s happened to the toilet paper by the way in public bathrooms ? It s not even one ply anymore . Is it ? It s a sheer suggestion of what toilet paper used to be . It s a innuendo , a ghost . It s like prosciutto . It s so thin . And then because it s so thin and it s on that huge cheese wheel size roll . It s like a spare tire roll of toilet paper . So the heaviness of the roll with the thinness of the paper trying to move it alone is just to just , please , if I could just have more than one . One . I just want , please just give me two note one . I just , uh , one . 15 minutes later you got 15 squares in your hand , which equal one ply . And then they re making things easier that don t need to be made easier . You know , these toilets that are flush and automatically now , which I ll decide when I m done . Because sometimes it just go off randomly . You re still sitting there . How dare you ? Because then they don t go off when you want them to . You re standing up . You re just staring at the toilet . You re just sitting down and fake it out again . And then you ve got to wash your hands . You have no control over that either . You ve got to , the sink , it has to see your hands first underneath . And then you , it decides how much water you need also . It gives you a certain portion . You don t know how much you re going to get , so you re like a little raccoon under there . </s> <s> Just . . . And then it decides that s enough water and it s not . So you have to pull out and go pretend like your new hands going back in again . And the dryer you put your hands under there quickly like that . And all this is to avoid germs . And you walk over to that diseased , written door handle and open it up . Back to that bowl of mixed nuts you re sharing at the bar . And then you re all paranoid because your friends are waiting at the bar even in the bathroom for half an hour . And you feel , you know , it s amazing how much time that we put thought into thinking about what other people are thinking about us . You know , when everybody else is just thinking about what we re thinking about them . We are so comfortable with that uncomfortable feeling that we just get so used to it . Anything , you know , if somebody s talking to you in a tiny bit of moisture comes out and lands on your cheek . You know it s there . They certainly know it s there . And nobody acknowledges it . You just keep talking directly into each other s eyes acting like that didn t just happen . Waiting for them to glance away just for a second so you can do that . Why is that would that insult them if they saw us wipe that away that you don t want that there ? Why would you wipe my spittle away ? Where just anything makes us uncomfortable . If you ever waved to somebody , you re sure it s them . Oh , there s Nancy . What s not Nancy ? Where d stuff happening inside ? It s really bad when you go out of your way to get their attention , isn t it ? Oh , look , there s Nancy . Nancy ! Nancy ! Nancy ! God ! Nancy ! That s why you re someone else . You know what , like Nancy ? Let s go . They don t like Nancy . Or if somebody s waving to you and you know you don t know them , but you wave back anyway . Or if you re walking down the street , good day for you too . Good self esteem day . You re happy with your outfit , happy with your hair , feeling really good about yourself . It just takes that one tiny trip to just suck the coolness right out of you . Can t let that happen . As soon as that happens , we have to look back right away . Pebble . Careful for the pebble . I just tripped and there s a right there . Someone should put some orange cones . There s a pebble up ahead . Or are we going to denial ? Are we going to that ? I was just going to start running anyway . I didn t trip . It s just going to run . I m running and I m done . That s all I needed . </s> <s> Stopped a time I shoe a block ago and I m back on schedule with that little jog . Like we re falling people across the way . Oh , she tripped . No , she was running . I thought she tripped , but she s running . She stopped . She did trip . You tripped . She tripped . Did you ever walk into a plate glass window ? Two things are happening there . Pain and embarrassment . But pain takes a back seat to embarrassment , doesn t it ? No matter how much pain you re in , if people are laughing , you just laugh along with them . No ? Bam ! I just slammed right into that thing . Isn t that funny ? It s so clean and shiny . Someone should put a sticker or a happy face or something . Isn t that funny ? Oh , my . Is that blood ? I m bleeding . Isn t that funny ? I m bleeding . Oh , my . Can you help me buy my eye ? I lost my eye . I cannot find my eye . It could be as big as that . It could be as small as you re with somebody and they re singing a song that you love . And they sing lyrics you ve never sung before . Suddenly you realize you ve been singing the wrong words all along . You re like , does he have it ? That s what they re singing right there . Does he have it ? He s like , is he singing monkey hatchet ? How many people have heard me sing monkey hatchet ? We all have songs you don t know the words too . Some songs you don t even bother trying to learn the words because you assume nobody knows them . </s>"

I m a God , man . It took me years to better do this show , boy . This is changed . It s different now . It s a lot of white people walking around . Isn t it ? I m going to be here . I live in the 80s . It was not like this in the 80s . When crack was going on , remember when crack was going on , why would we be looking at DC from Virginia with binoculars ? You know ? Well , that looks dangerous . Not yet . New white people . You can t scare these white people . I tried . We rolled up on a boo . The hell is wrong with you . Those days are over . I m glad that you know , like we do on a show here by Howard , you know , and you see like white people come out and it s good . One thing I m seeing , you know , you walk on a street and you ll see like a group of black dudes walking . Not just any old black dudes . We talk on , you know , thugs . Talking , you know . I d be some thugs . And in the group , in the group , they got like one or two . Sometimes there s many , there s three white guys that be with them . You ever seen this shit ? Let me tell you something about those white guys . Those white guys are the most dangerous motherfuckers in them groups . That was true . It s true , man . They ain t no telling what they ve done to get them black dudes respect . Well , then black dudes have seen them do some wild shit . I ll tell you that . I would try to tell brothers that every , every group of brothers should have at least one white guy in it . I m serious for safety . Because when it shit goes down , somebody s going to need to talk to the police . I mean , that s when our , that s when our wife friend comes in handy . Uh oh , Ernie , you want to get this one ? Come on now . Come on now . Do something . </s> <s> It s the black people are very afraid of the police . There s a big part of our culture . Don t man how rich you are ? How old you are ? We re just afraid of them . We got every reason to be afraid of them . You know what I mean ? Like you re a white lady . You haven t been pulled over before . You know , and then what they say , let me see your driver s license . And your registration , right ? See ? See , I m just guessing . That s not what they say to us . You wouldn t believe what they say to us . Spread your cheeks and lift your sack . Like what ? Excuse me ? You heard me spread over your cheeks and lift your sack . I got a driver s license too . It was easier ways to prove who I am , is you ? What was that proof ? I can t go to the bank like that . Cash my check . What do you mean you don t have any idea ? Wait a minute . Oh . Oh , I m sorry , Mrs . DePel . Right , this way . Why didn t you spread your cheeks in the beginning ? Scared of them . I m serious , man . You ll be in a red light to police my pull up next to you . It won t be no big deal for you , but you know what ? I m fucking falling apart . Oh , oh , no . Don t look over there . But I didn t always know there was a black thing that took me a while to figure that out . I learned that shit in New York . I was a New York City . Now , I was hanging out with a friend of mine . He s a white guy , you know . We were just hanging out . And we were lost in the city . You know , he s smoking a joint . Now , I don t know if it s a coincidence that we were lost in the high end ship , but my wife , but he was smoking a joint . Dave , Dave . Mr . Goddamn cops . I m gonna ask him for directions . I said , Chip , no , Chip , don t do it . It was too late . He was walking over to this man , was high as shit . Excuse me . Excuse me , sir . Touching him and shit . Excuse me . And he s some information . It s not confessing things , he shouldn t confess . I m a little high . All I want to know , which way is search street ? The cop was like , hey , take it easy . You re on third street . You better be careful . Go ahead , move it . Move it . That s all that happened . That s the end of the story . Now , I know that s not amazing to some of you , but yeah , it s one of these black fellows . That shit is fucking incredible , isn t it ? I m saying , a black man will never dream of talking to the police high . </s> <s> That s a waste of weed . Serious . I m obviously a guy that told the police when I m sleepy . It s fucking around , get the wrong ideas . Oh ! Oh , my God . That nigga was on PCP , Johnson . I had to use necessary force . I had to use all of them . No , no , no paper work . Just sprinkle some crack on them . Let s get out of here . That s how it is , but at the time I didn t think was anything racial about it . I was just like , man , chip , you got fucking lucky . You better be careful . But then another time , me and Chip are driving . Now I m not driving . Chip is driving , and he s driving a little crazy . He s been drinking . I don t like to let my friends drive drunk , but you know , I was smoking a joint . I couldn t really say shit to the guy . And we get it a red light . We stop it a red light . And the car pulls up next to us , and I ll never forget it . Chip , he looks at me as old drunk as he s like , Dave . I m gonna race him . I knew it was a bad idea , but I was hot . I tried to explain when it was a bad idea , but all that came out was , well , I think it s sometimes a guy race , I don t know . Man , that light turned green , and Chip took off . Ziggs , that , and his chips , and all that could happen . I don t even know who was racing . Then the police seen us , and pulled us over . They re gonna say , and I m scared of shit . I mean , come on , the cosmo s like , we , I m been speeding this man , as fucking drunk . I m scared . Chip was not scared of all . It was weird . He didn t turn his radio down . It was weird , a little bit . I mean , if you get pulled over , wouldn t you turn your radio down ? I don t buy one , get that ASB to a soundtrack and shit . I m saying , Chip had a music blast , and we re not gonna take it . It was a day just for a lax . Close your butt cheeks , trunks . Let me do the talking . You wanna know what he said ? He s almost exactly what he said . I kind of believe it . He says , oh , oh , oh . Sorry , Officer . I didn t know I couldn t do that . I was fucking shocked . The cops said , well now you know . Just get out of here . Just get the fuck out of here . Chip said , okay , I will , sir . Thank you . What ? What s wrong with you , Dave ? </s> <s> I didn t know I couldn t do that . You said that was good , wasn t it ? Because I did know I couldn t do that . I was shocked . I wasn t shocked at the audacity , but I was just shocked because I would have never thought to say that . I don t think any black dude would think to say that because they know we know the law . Every black dude in this room is a qualified paralegal and shit . He knows a lot . One of us even started to do something wrong , an old black man , and pop out of nowhere . Nicking out to that , that s five to ten . Watch out . When we know the laws and the penalties , that chip didn t even know he couldn t race . I m not saying I don t like police . I m not saying that . I m saying I m just scared of them . And then wrong with that . Sometimes we want to call them too . Somebody broken to my house once . It s a good time to call them , but I don t know . The house is too nice . And ain t a real nice house , but they never believe I live it . He s still here . Oh my god . Open and shut case , Johnson . I saw this once before when I was a rookie . Apparently the snigger broke in and hung up pictures of his family everywhere . Well , let s sprinkle some crack on him and get out of here . I ll get it . I said , that s a whole brutality thing . See , that s common knowledge , man . It was a time when only minorities really knew about that . I m not going to say why people didn t believe us , but you were low skeptical . You were low skeptical . I mean , I don t blame you . And then Newsweek printed and he knew it was true . And then the Newsweek wife was like , oh my god . Honey , did you see this ? Apparently the police have been beating up Negroes like hotcakes . It s in the main issue . I mean , really , how could you know that ? How could anyone else know ? I mean , maybe you should have seen something a little suspicious . I don t know . I think it was like a little suspicious . A little suspicious . Every dead black person in police fan has cracked sprinkled on him and come on in . Come on , man . Who gets shot and sprinkles crack on themselves ? Nobody will do you . Bam ! Oh , oh . I don t want to leave no mysteries . I m a paranoid guy , you know what I am . I was scared to call 911 for anything . Even if it s like a fire or anything . Because they take those phone calls . I see the shows , they tape them . And then they play them on television . </s> <s> That s fucked up . Now , I ll say anything if I m scared , that shit is private , you know what I mean ?

That shit was sound ridiculous . Hello , emergency . Hi . Hey , 911 , how are you ? Yeah . Look , there s a group of hooded white men gathering outside of my house . And it looks like they mean business . Get out here , Nader . I gotta go . You guys trained her . It s too much pressure . That s my problem . I can t handle pressure . Sometimes pressure makes me talk different . I m serious . You ever have that social pressure ? You ever talk to somebody who s fake and they make you fake ? Like , that kind of thing . Hey , how you doing ? You re like fine . You re like , I don t even talk like that . I get sick of that shit . I do it . It just makes me sick .

How do I know I don t talk like that every day ? Stop talking like that . Stop talking like that . Stop talking like white cover . Bang . Try to talk , say . You gotta make life interesting like that , because the shit is flimsy . Life is flimsy . You think you re gonna live forever . I ain t gonna live forever . It s dangerous out here . We know what s going on . I travel now . I just think DC had the roughest ghettos in the country . Nah , they go , oh . I have seen some shit now . Oh , there s some rough , rough areas outside of DC . Yeah , everybody should go to the ghetto . I was taken to the ghetto one time . That s the worst . Will you get taken to the United Expecting to go ? Usually you wanna know when you re going to get it . Like , I m gonna see some wild shit . I gotta prepare myself . I m gonna see some crazy . When you re taken , it s different . I had a limousine driver . It was after a show who was late at night . It was like three in the morning . I had a limousine driver . He was a nice guy . I m talking to me and shit . Oh , hey , where you from , dawg ? DC ? Where ? That s a rough city , man . And his cell phone started ringing . Hold on a second . Hello ? Oh , something . What ? What the fuck ? What the fuck ? No . No . No . No . Fuck that . Nigga , fuck it . I m on my way . Woo . Hey . I gotta make a stop real quick . At three o clock in the morning , I didn t know he was taking me to get it with first . That s how I look at the winner . I was like , what the fuck ? Gunstore gunstore gunstore gunstore ? Where the fuck you taking me ? It s not look good . He didn t say shit . Just pulled up from my old , rickety building . That looked like a project . Now , I d never been there before .

You only see this in the worst neighborhoods . Remember , it s three o clock in the morning . It s three o clock in the morning . I look out the window . It was a fucking baby standing on a corner . It was . And the baby , the baby didn t even look scared . He was just standing there . I mean , it made me sad . It made me sad , really . You know what I mean ? I wanted to help the baby . Well , I don t trust you either . I m sorry . Click . Click . The old baby on the corner trick , eh ? I m not gonna fall for that shit . I m not gonna fall for that shit . I m not gonna fall for that shit . I m not gonna fall for that shit . I m not gonna fall for that shit . Where s this limousine drive ? I mean , I stopped feeling bad . It s time goes by , I stopped feeling worse . I said , man , what is wrong with me ? What the hell is wrong ? I m scared of a baby . This baby could be in trouble . He might need my help . I gotta do something . But I wasn t gonna get out the car . I m serious , man . I was cracking the window a little bit . It was a old limousine . I could roll it down . Hey , baby . Baby , go home . Man , it s three o clock in the morning . What the fuck are you doing up ? The baby said , I m seven weeks . They gots at home . I want to respect it in . I m sorry I had to buy two bags from the car , but I m gonna get to the car . I m back in the car and rolled me a joint , man . That shit was scary , man .

Get out of here , cracky . </s> <s> That baby was still standing there , man . That s not feeling bad again . Yeah , we make it feel guilty sometimes . What is wrong with me , man ? I have just bought weed from an infant . I can t condone this kind of behavior . What am I thinking ? I can t let the fear ruin my morals . I ve got to do something . Hey , baby . Stop selling weed , all right ? You got your whole life ahead of you . You said , fuck you . Look , I can t see feed . That s a guy . Sam . And this is that very moment when the crack hit us around across the street and got hit by a car . I know it was a hit and run . The police did it . That s all right . They spring us from crack on to me , got back up . Obviously , that kind of shit , man . It s what is . They use the TV to program us from a young age . You ever watch like a cartoon , as you used to watch me a little , as an adult ? Is it wild shit ? It s wild shit . I mean , I was with my nephew . We sitting there , we watching Peppie the Pew . I said to my nephew , I said , now pay attention to this guy , because he s funny . I used to watch him when I was little . And we watched Peppie the Pew , but I m old now . I m looking like , good God . I m kind of fucking rapistist this guy . I take the music . Come on , Peppie was sitting there cracking up . See ? Sometimes you got to take the pussy like Peppie . Like , oh , no . I had to turn the channel real quick . I turned on Sesame Street . I said , oh , Sesame Street is much better , because now he ll learn how to count and spell . But now I m watching it as an adult , and I realized Sesame Street teaches kids other things . And teaches kids how to judge people and label people . That s right . They got a character on it named Oscar . The treat just got like shit , the entire show . They judge him right in his face . Oscar , you are so mean . Isn t it kids ? Yeah , Oscar . You re a grouch . It s like , bitch , I live in a fucking trash can . On the porch , my mother fuck on Sesame Street . Nobody s helping me . Then you went away , kids were all up and stepped over homeless people . Get it together , grouch . Get a job , grouch . So don t even tell me how to get to Sesame Street . That is a terrible place . I want to go there if I knew the way . Who would want to live in a neighborhood like that ? </s> <s> Fucking six foot pigeons walking around . The elephant that s a junkie . A hoiper . Yeah , that s right , snappy . Hoiper , a sick . We need some smack bird . Then cook your monster with his eyes popping out his hands . Cooky , cooky , cooky . Kinda , cookies are you talking about ? Chocolate chips don t do that to people . And then had to nerve to put a pimple on them . They didn t come out and say he s a pimple . But I know a pimple when I see one . They called him the count . Kinda paint them every time . You can see him pimping , bitch . Where does my money ? You ve been late four times . I ve been counting . How many times must I smack you before you left right ? Five , two , two , one . Two spots . Ah , ah , ah , ah , ah . That s a thing . There s so much stuff to worry about . The more you know , the more you don t know one shit . A lot of people would be telling me , Dave , you know , you just got relaxed and racist . I m thinking we buggin you too much . I d be thinking about it . Sometimes shit don t happen . You know a lot of black people can relate to this . Have you ever had something happen that was so racist that she didn t even get mad ? He was just like , God , damn , that was racist . That was racist . I mean , it was so blatant . He was just like , wow . Right , he almost like it didn t even happen to you . It was like a fucking movie . That was like , he was watching Mississippi Burnin . Wow . And having a meal , I was in Mississippi . I was in Mississippi doing a show . And I go to the restaurant to order some food . And I said to the guy , I said , I would like to have and before I even finish my sentence , he says , the chicken . What the fuck ? I could not believe it . I could not believe that shit . This man was absolutely right . I said , how did he know ? That I was going to get some chicken . I asked him , I said , how you know that ? How did you know I was going to get some chicken ? He looked at me like I was crazy . Come on , buddy . Come on , buddy . Now , everybody knew soon you out to the goddamn door you re going to get some chicken . There s no secret down here that blacks and chickens are quite fond of one another . Then I finally understood what he was saying . And I got upset . I wasn t even mad . I was just upset . I wasn t ready to hear that shit . All these years , I thought I liked chicken because it was delicious . </s> <s> Turns out I m genetically predisposed to like a chicken . I said , what ? I got no say in the man . I got a ruined chicken for me . I m scared he didn t public . I almost saw my assidient and say something . I mean , I mean , I eat some chicken . Oh , come on . Look at him . He loves him . Just like it s said in the Encyclopedia . Look how happy he looks . Sometimes he will be too much to deal with . Has show business been crazy ? That s what the culture s really collide . Show business bring a lot of races together . Sometimes it works . This is one thing that happens that s funny . Sometimes I ll be on a business call , right ? You know , like with the lawyer , and I will be on a call , right ? And they ll be like , oh , okay , Dave , we re going to close the deals . Is that fine with you ? That s good for me . Great . You have a good week , Dave . I ll be like , all right , you two , man . Peace . All right , bye bye . And I know what to say , right ? Sometimes I ll make up shit that s not even sane . Just to see how they handle it and should be . It d be the same business call . All right , we re going to close the deals . Is that fine with you , Dave ? Yeah , sounds good to me . Great . You have a good week , Dave . All right , buddy . Zip it up . And zip it out . All right , so be the new dog . Bye bye . Okay . Sometimes , you know , sometimes raises and works out . And black people s favor . Yeah , it doesn t happen often . It happens very rarely . But what happens , it is fucking sweet . I m serious . It s one time racism saved my life man . I was on a plane . I was coming from overseas . And I don t know how this guy got a machine gun on the plane , but he stood up , man . He said , everybody , get on the fucking ground . Nobody look at my face . I started freaking out . Because he was Chinese . I was like , why is he talking like that ? He was screaming and crying . I was the only brother on the plane . Well , I thought I was the only brother . I looked over . It was one of the black dudes . He was from Nigeria . I looked over them . He was looking right in my face , man . He didn t say two words to me . He just looked at me . He was like , pff . He didn t need to talk . </s> <s> I know what just we was talking about . I looked right back at him . I was right . So my dudes on the front of the plane seen us . They were like , oh , my God . I think those black guys are going to try to save us . We were just communicating that we understood the situation . We were both seeing the same thing . What we understood was simple . Terrorists don t take black hostages . That s the truth . I have yet to see one of us on the news reading the houses of that engine . They is treating us good . We are chilling in shit . I like to give a shout out to Ray Ray and Big Steve . And Jason Leopold . You re not going to see it . Terrorists are smart . They know what they re doing now . They re terrorists . They know what black people s bad bargaining chips . They call the White House . Hello . We have got five blood . Blood . Hello . You be back in DC . You know what I was thinking ? This is an election year . I m asking you , you know who you re voting for yet . Don t know . Now you see what just happened here . Let me tell you something . That is a cultural thing . He knows who is going to vote for . He s just not going to tell me . I ve noticed that . That is a cultural thing . White people do not like to talk about their political affiliations . It s a secret . You ever ask a white guy who s voting for you ? Hey , Bob , Bob , we re going to vote for it . Dave , Dave , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Take it easy , Nick . Take it easy . So anyway , I was fucking my wife and a rat , right ? And I mean , it was something else . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . But who are you voting for ? Dave ! Dave , come on with the voting . I m trying to talk about the fucking my wife here . Ask me all these personal questions . They don t like to divulge that information . Because it matters to them . Black people talk about that shit . Black people openly talk about politics . Black people openly talk about beating up politicians or shit . I see George Bush , our kicker s motherfucking ass for cutting my Medicaid . Oh , okay , okay , let me see it . Probably just say it . But there s a reason for that . There s a matter is more for the matters more . Black people see , see , even when I vote , right ? Which I don t . But even when I think about who I would vote for , right ? I don t even look at their political policies . I just look at their character . You know what I m saying now ? You got to read , no , I m serious . You got to read between the lines . You know , you look at Clinton and black people like Clinton . Because we ve seen him on a campaign trail . </s> <s> He actually just picked up black baby up and kicked him . I don t think her baby was . Okay . Mm hmm . I like that . He did not have the pain or nothing . You see , George Bush Jr . he being in . . . Ugh . Oh , crap . Like I said , I d never vote for George Bush Jr . But I don t know George Bush Jr . s politics . I don t think I know about George Bush Jr . is that that guy sniffed cocaine . That s right . Now listen , we cannot have that shooting the White House . That might be fine for a mayor , but God damn it , not in the White House . Right in the White House . Right in the White House . Right in the White House . The stakes are too high in the White House . I can t have no coke here , President . Oh . Maybe selling nuclear seekers for 20 , 30 in shit . Could be a meetings in Barrison America . Come on . Sign the treaty , baby . I suck your dick . Like what the . . . Mr . President . Well , Mr . President , that is not how we do business here , sir . Stop sucking the ambassador s dick . No , I m not going to let him finish . I was signing the treaty . It will be peace in Israel finally . I vote for Clinton again if I could . It s always better . Now again , I m not looking at his politics . Don t know what his politics are . I m just looking at his behavior . I understand that kind of behavior . I know a lot of dudes with them shortcomings . We ve smoking fornicators . There s a lot of them . Come on , let s be honest . Bill Clinton was not the first president to do what he did . Now , let s just . . . Let s think back for him . A rumor guy named Kennedy , John F . Kennedy , remember him . He fucked Marilyn Monroe . No matter what , him and his brother Bobby fucked Marilyn Monroe . And his free done talk about that much . Because those two pages in history , I stuck together . They were getting on . They were getting it on . I ve seen the tapes . Remember the tapes you d be singing on Nancy , this party , stressing them out . He is dead . Mr . Prince is dead . Bitch , my family s here . Clinton did the same thing . But he didn t do it like that . Because the year 2000 , he s busier than Kennedy was . He was a busy man . Clinton did that kind of thing the way busy men do it . You know what busy men do ? They fuck who s close to them . I can tell that s what Clinton was up to . Look like you just stuck us head out the office door . No more . You ! Come here ! Come here ! I made my cleanest up from a 3 3rd to come home . </s> <s> Oh , boy . He s probably looking at Kennedy s picture and shit . Oh , boy . And in the top of it all , he lied . Which I thought was just , I thought that was special . I think it , man . I don t know how you did . I ve been accused of having sex with a girl I d not have sex with before . Let me tell you something . That shit isn t furious . You ever go through that ? It ll make you crazy . You screaming at your best friends . I didn t touch that bitch thing . I killed you . Fuck you , nigga . I killed you . Please believe me . Please believe me . You re Clinton didn t do it like that , did it ? Clinton came out of the press conference all relaxed . So , so does all relax and all this trouble . Look like you just got done fucking it . Oh . Listen . I didn t tell you something , America . I don t think you heard me the first time . I did not have sexual relations with that woman . Mr . Whiskey . You know what I mean ? Everybody knew that thing was male like nobody cared . Nobody cared . We all watched . We was disgusted . We kept watching the news . I know I was taping it . So I made the crib like maybe turn the lights off and the news is coming on . Every week on 60 minutes was a different girl accused and Clinton . Remember Kathleen Willie came out ? She was upstairs . The president called me into his office . He began . . . . . . sodging my breast . So I m sorry . And then he placed my hand . . . . . . on his genitals . And Bradley was shocked . Who ? Was he a roust ? I was at home like , yeah , was he a roust ? And then and Bradley looked right in the camera . And he said , don t bust that nut yet . We ll be right back . Oh man , the news ain t never been so good . But there were no victims . Only one I feel sorry for is that Louis Kaffirlo . Don t you feel sorry for her ? God , thank you . Come on . You have a hard thing to be famous for . Nobody want to be the most famous cock suck of all times . I feel bad for her . Not even a woman feels sorry for a little bit , ladies . Now that s jealousy . That s what that is . Come on , that girl suck is going to haunt her for the rest of her life . Long after she spent that money up , that s still going to haunt her . I know there s a lot of women in here with the least one dick they regret . And I bet she wasn t a president s dick . I bet she worked at Kenny Shoes , the Safeway in some sort of a mess . </s> <s> Don t go judge him . See , we got to stop judging people . That girl was young and she made a mistake that young girls make . She wanted to fuck a powerful man . Period . She thought it through . She wanted to think about how powerful the president was . She had no wisdom . Older woman would have helped everybody . Older woman would have been in there . You know , you should lower taxes . I m sorry . Older woman would have sucked us into the utopia . Last thing I was about it is this , that he is a famous man . I have a dream of being famous , but I never dreamt of being that famous . I never understood how famous a president was . Imagine if someone could suck your dick and then they re famous . You know what I m saying ? That s crazy . That s crazy . I mean , no guy would thought of that . There s nobody with a pickup line that good and shit . They suck my dick . There s a future in it . That s it now . Get out there and be somebody . Go out of book . You re a qualified offer now . Go out of book . I said , I m in the wrong business . I should be the president . Shit , I m in the wrong business . See , only reason I want to be president is because I m black . That doesn t make it too hot for me . I mean , I mean , I think it could be a black president one day , but you don t want to be the first one . I mean , second and third , that s fine . But that first thing I could do was to get a job . I mean , I m not going to be the president . I m not going to be the president . I m not going to be the president . I m not going to be the president . I m not going to be the president . That s fine . But that first thing I could better watch out . I m going to tell you that right now . Too hot . I mean , I d be the first black president . I don t think that nobody would really , really hurt me . I m sure somebody would want to hurt me , but I don t think they touched me because of my vice president will be Mexican for a little insurance . You know what I m saying ? You know what I m saying ? You can shoot me if you want , but you re just going to open the border up , so . . . You might as well leave me and vice president Santiago to our own devices . Ain t that right , Santiago ? See ! See ! See ! Elyon can stay . Don t worry , don t worry . </s> <s> I don t got no Elyon jokes . All I ll say about Elyon is thank God he s Cuban . If he was Haitian , you d have never heard about his ex . Thank God . If Elyon comes out of the house , Elyon was Elyon the moonbow from Haiti . They d have pushed that little rubber tube right back in the water . Sorry , I fell on fall . Good luck . The only thing I society that bothers me the most is the way that men and women don t get along no more . That s really what s bugging me about it . Men and women just don t get along . Like I hear women say this all the time . I know a lot of you say it s gonna be like , shivori is dead . Don t you feel that way ? Like men aren t gentlemen anymore ? That s right . Shivori is dead and women killed it . As a fundamental difference in the way we re gonna see things , we re not gonna see how to out on this issue . We re just not . Our test in life are different . A woman s test in life is material . A man s test in life is a woman . Now by test I mean it , those are the things that we desire . Men have nice cars , not because they like nice cars , because they know women like nice cars . That s how it goes . Because men are hunters and the car is the bait . And a woman comes and says , ooh nice Porsche . Gotcha bitch . That s how it is . That s true . Come on there , you go to a woman s house . Her house be comfortable as shit . Women love comfortable surroundings . So men get comfortable surroundings . Let me tell you something . A man can fuck a woman in a cardboard box . He went by a house . But that s still not where Shivori got killed . Shivori got killed by the feminist movement on the magazines that got women going crazy . Because women got too much advice about men from other women . And they don t know what the fuck they talk about . That s true . I see this shit in a magazine . I don t read them , but I ve been seeing the cover . I ve been a grocery store fellow . He looked at one of the magazines like what is this ? And they say on the cover , 100 ways to please your man by some lady . Get out of here . And 100 ways . This is 4 things . Just suck his dick ін . Fix him a sandwich . Don t talk so much . Never do I have a hand . And men , the magazines trick the women . The magazines start picking at your self esteem . Every page you turn you start feeling fatter and uglier . And you feel like your clothes aren t good enough . And the magazines have you forget how fucking beautiful you are . And that s what happens . Now look what happens . And then you forget how beautiful you are . And we all suffer . If pussy was a stop , it would be plummeting right now . Because you flooded the market with it . </s> <s> You re giving it away too easy . Is it I m just being truthful ? I m just talking . It would plummet . We ll be watching this today . Pussy plummeting again . Well , then I stay . Gold is up 10 points . You can see it . You ever have this happen ? This is how confusing it is . This is the practical application when I m talking about . Like a guy be out . This happen to go out guys . You be out of club . You re kicking with your boys . And a girl walks by . And a man she looks good . She looks good . Not good in that classical way . I m talking good . Like she got half her ass hanging out her skirt . Her titties are all mashed together . Popping out the top of her turtle neck and shit . And you with your buddies , right ? You with your buddies . You got a couple of drinks in here . And you see a guy just who might try to talk to it . It might not come out right now . I don t want you to say that . Damn , look at him titties . The girl gets mad . Oh , oh , wait a minute . Wait a minute . Just because I m dressed this way . I m going to be like , I m going to be like , I m going to be like , I m going to be like , just because I m dressed this way . Does not . Make me a hoe . Which is true . Gentlemen , that is true just because they dress a certain way . It s a mean they are a certain way . Don t ever forget it . But ladies , you must understand that that is fucking confusing . Just the ends . Now that would be like me . They should pay out a comedian walking around the streets and it got me in a form . Somebody might run up on me . Oh , thank God . Officer , help us . Come on over here . Help us . I m going to be like , oh , just because I m dressed this way . Does not make me a police officer . You understand what I m saying ? I was like , all right , lady , fine . Fine . You are not a whore . But you are wearing a horse uniform . I ll tell you that . You re going to misunderstand this can happen . And then , man , we misunderstand women a lot . You know , we always undermine their feelings . You can t do that to them . You can t because , see , feelings , are very important to women . They are all important . I m just learning this shit . Everything is based on how they feel . You can hear when they tell stories . If a man tells a story , it would be just facts . Who would win , where , why ? It was me and Bob . We was at Safeway . Then I said , Bob said this . And I pushed that nigga and then I broke out . </s> <s> That s the story . Women tell stories and all these feelings . Well , first of all , he was understanding . I was on my period and I just talked to my mother . So I was feeling like , I had a fan . It was too many feelings . The fuck happened ? You can do it . But I got to talk about them . I got to talk about them . That s how they always get me . I was sitting there watching TV , chilling , and shit . My old lady , my old lady , come up to me . David , we need to talk . Fuck ! I don t say that out loud . That s how I feel inside .

Bo knew that he d have to answer riddle to get by . The troll spoke thus . All right , for the last time , man , I m not a troll . I m homeless . Okay , do you have any spare change ? Okay , that s a used napkin . I don t want that . No , no , stop . Just leave , just leave , please leave . And then , as Bose arrived on the other side of the stage , he saw a unicorn with five horns right in front of him . And the pentacorn spoke thus . Hello , Bose . I ve been looking for you for quite a long time . He was safe for now . But the dark thoughts would soon return . Scottylla ! It s so hard to be a lizard . It s so hard to be a lizard . It s so hard to be a lizard . It s so hard to be a lizard . It s so hard to be a lizard . It s so hard to be a lizard . It s so hard to be a lizard . Why ? But it s harder to segue .

It s so hard to be a lizard . It s so hard to be a lizard . It s so hard to be a lizard . Naturally good . This is the end of the song in the beginning of the show . Welcome to the show . That lizard part is pretty stupid . Anyway , San Francisco . Yeah , we are a place . We are a place in California . I d like to start with a joke for my male audience . This is a joke for the fellas . Where are my fellas at ? Fellas . Yo , fellas , don t you hate him when you re blowing a guy ? You re gonna be a faggot ? Am I right ? I ve been blowing a faggot this whole time . Third time this week . Thank you so much . Very good . This show is called What ? And I hope there are some surprises for you . It s a good start .

Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , but you all thought it wasn t accident . </s> <s> But he meant to play the water track . Yeah , yeah , yeah , art is a lie . Nothing is real . Food jokes . Let s do some food jokes . Segways are weird . I had a hot dog for breakfast today . And afterwards I felt like this . Because I couldn t control my stools . All right , Jesus . Glad you like poop based puns . That ll be a majority of the show . Never waste a moment . Every moment can become a comedic moment . See ? So just a little lesson for comedians . This first song is called A World on Fire . This next song is a little bit longer than that one . And thank you . It s about how sad I am . And I m really sad and it s called sad . It s about all the sad stuff . Just picture a depressed onion cutting itself . I met a homeless man named Rich . Isn t that terrible ? I started a flyer for a lost dog . And the dog didn t have any legs . I started a diabetic kid . Trick or treating . I saw a giraffe who had a short neck . That was sad . Or a deer . I saw an old man get hit by a train . He didn t see it in the pouring rain . He didn t hear me shout look out for the train . Because I didn t say anything . I just thought to myself , this is going to be sad . And it was . I m a genius . I saw a man with only one eye . In a 3D movie , I saw a little boy drop his ice cream cone directly on his mother s corpse . I saw a kid stuck in a tree . And the kid jumped off and hung itself . I saw a boy with red hair . I went to a store looking for something to buy . But they only sold paintings of the same sad guy . No way . This store sells mirrors . See what I did there . Let s rock . I don t know . The world s so sad , bros . Pain . Genocide . War . Sexism . Racism . But I ve got to remember there s good things about it too . Like the fact that none of that s happening to me . Score . Still though it s hard not to be sad about it . How do y all do it ? I ve been telling you guys terribly sad things . This whole song , you ve been sad at all . You ve been happy . No . You ve been laughing . That s it . Laughter . It s the key to everything . It s the way to solve all the sadness in the world . I mean , not for the people that are actually sad . But the people like us , they ve got a fucking deal with them all the time . Being a comedian isn t being an insensitive prick . Capitalizing in the most animalistic impulses of the public . So the world isn t sad . </s> <s> The world s funny . I m a sociopath . That s our old man s lip and faal . What a fucking idiot . That s our old woman and her daughter s funeral . Classic comedy . Everything that once was sad . Is somehow funny now . The Holocaust in 9 11 . That shit s funny . 24 7 goes tragedy . We ll be exclusively jokes about . Because my empathy is bumming me out . Goodbye , sadness . Hello , jokes . Thank you . I m going to really good joke about video editors . Video editors are so fucking . I think we should do a poem right now . This poem is a little bit sappy , a little bit romantic . So we ll get it out of the way now . And we will go back to the dirty stuff . Everyone loves it . A late show or whatever . Okay . It s called I Fuck Sluts . It s not a roll call , but thank you . Sluts . Sluts . Sluts . I Fuck Sluts . Sluts get fucked when I fuck sluts . No if and or butts . I Fuck Sluts . Nice girls are nice , but no good for nuts . Sucking they ll need a serene night degree light of butt fucking . But that ll be easy . I m not a good girl . Praise be to slut fucking . I have a list . A list . Yes , a list of all the sluts I ve missed . I never fucked or suck these sluts , and nuts my nuts are fucking pissed . So when I fuck the lucky slut , my nut removes her from the list . Another dumb , come bucket struck from my nut sucking , suck it slut slut fucking bucket list . Yes , you hear the influences . Chaucer . Keats . Pays her blank . I know it . Why am I lying to you ? Sluts can be white , black , brown , pink , or almond . They can be skinny with big tits , or be skinny with small ones . Sluts can be perky , preppy or posh with their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash . Excuse me . But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart . These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick . To your heart , they can talk about science , music , or art . They can put you together . Or they can pull you apart , but don t trust these sluts . Don t you dare , the force you trust them and love them and care . And then they ll be gone and then you ll be aware of that hole in your heart that that dumb slut left there . Thank you very much . So he was lashing out with sexist language because he had his heart broken . We all learned something . </s> <s> Thank you for coming . I know some of my bits are a little bit fast and dance a little bit hard to follow , particularly that one . So I want to do something a little bit slower for the people , maybe the older people in the crowd or something . So this for you . Here s a slow joke . What did the ear of corn say when all of its corn fell off ? Oh , shucks . Get it ? Like shucks as in shucking corn and also shucks the exclamation . Have my wife ? Good . My father recently told me that I act too flamboyant on stage and I said , really dad , prove it . He said , what about that joke where you throw confetti at the end of it ? I said , I haven t written that joke yet because it s based off this conversation . Gotcha . Keep it , keep the struggle . We re doing a lot of fun guys . Don t worry about , you don t have to fill the the the silences with laughter or applause . I don t want you leaving the show thinking , my hands hurt from clapping , my stomach hurts from laughing . I just want you leaving the show thinking , all right . And we re on our way . I moved to Hollywood recently from Boston where I grew up and places . And I heard about these wild Hollywood party nights that people would have and I didn t think they were true until I moved to Hollywood and I started having them . Anyway , this is a song about a crazy night that happened a couple weeks ago . It s called What Did I Do Last Night ? G G . A A A . What Did I Do Last Night ? I cried myself to sleep . It was a good one . I was eight years old . I was eight years old . She brought me into the dining room . She sat right across the table from me . She said , do you know how your father and I love each other ? Instead of course , you and dad love each other . More than two people in the world could possibly love each other . She said , well , two men can love each other in the exact same way . I said , well , I m not going to love each other . I m not going to love each other . I m not going to love each other . She said , well , two men can love each other in the exact same way that your father and I love each other . She said , what happens when two men love each other like that ? What they do is they take off all their clothes , they get in a bed , and they shit on the Bible ! So don t talk to her anymore . Okay . Hello , patient two for six or two . Hi , I m sorry . How are you feeling ? Not great . Has the treatment been working ? No , it hasn t been . What are your remaining symptoms ? I just , I internalize my feelings . I just , I have trouble artic Like other people and relating to them is just far . </s> <s> So far , still a little bitch . Yeah , real mature of you . Disembodied voice up there .

I m just stating facts . And the fact is , you re a quivering pussy . I m the pussy . Well , they said I m playing with toys still . Okay , Rubik s cubes are not toys . They keep my spatial reasoning skills sharp . Let brain play the toys . Look at you , Johnny . Fucking toy player . Well , they said , if I fucking job , I kept them working . I kept them productive . You were supposed to look after him . You were supposed to keep him emotionally stable through all this . Now you re trying to blame me for how he s feeling . If he s feeling unhappy , it s because you failed him . You did this to me , hates you , I know he does . He fucking hates you . Right brain , look , I m sorry . No , you re not . Look , maybe there s something that we could do together . Together , take the best parts of both of us . Put him together . I m listening . It would let you let your feelings out . It would let me analyze . So you could man the themes , I ll man the form . It s something that George Carlin did . It s something that Steve Martin did .

I m pretty fucking deep . Deep , deep . So deep . But I called this song . Hashtag deep . Have you ever stopped to watch a blooper drop from a tree ? Have you ever stopped to watch a blooper drop from a tree ? And take to the air ? Me neither . Have you ever took time out to finish a rhyme ? But the right words just weren t there ? Me , cleaver . The people in my life are like grains of sand . Because they stick together . Often near my butthole if life is un ocean . I am a deep and handsome fish . A fish that s drowning . If the artistic process is a birth canal then I am a freshly jelly kid . Come witness my crowning . These thoughts of mine must be a sign that I m astounding . If Jesus can walk on water , can he swim on land ? </s> <s> Have you ever accidentally peed on the toilet seat instead of on your girlfriend s face ? Me neither . Have you ever wrote a song note for note and not a single note was out of place ? The people in my life are like plates of grass . How ? Because they re also grounded . But at least grass stays away from my bottle . Art is a harlot . And I am her sassy urban friend . It s why you ve been so selfish . If mama is right and the world is my oyster then I must have an allergy to share . You don t know . How could you know ? If life makes you wish you were dead . Just put on a good movie then promptly put up bullet in your head . Fend forever asleep . Cause life pales in comparison to living the dream . Hashtag dear . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .

I m releasing this special for free . I m going to write this on my new poems . It s a poem by a dog . They re pretty serious . This is the lull of the show . At this point I take the pressure off the audience and read poems and then we ll go back to the giggles . This is a poem by a dog . This is a different shade of gray . Let s go chase cars . Me with my strange choice of adjectives . You with your muscular teeth and clockwise vagina . I put a chameleon on a red dildo . He blushed . There we go . This is a poem about beauty , about self image and about the ability to transform . Martha was ugly like a shaven baboon . So she wrapped herself up in a curtain cocoon . And after a week she finally emerged . She smelled like shit . What a psycho . You re incomparable . Like a . . . I want to beat you to death with a blunt object . I want to grab one of those high end fashion mannequins by the ankles and bash your ribcage in . I want to sharpen 50 pencils , bind them with a rubber band , stick the lead in your mouth and punch the eraser . I want to strap you a bit of nails and strap that bit of nails to the hood of my car so I can watch you suffer . Be dry over speed bumps in a mall parking lot during an earthquake . I want you to somehow survive a terrible car crash and somehow not survive a small fender bender on the way back to the hospital . Thank you , that s called Dad . This is a poem . It s really a story that s meant primarily for children , but I think it s got a lesson we could all learn . </s> <s> The squares lived happily in their square houses , in their square yard , in their square town , but then one day a family of circles moved in from the west . Get out of here , roundies . Shouted one of the squares . Why said one of the circles ? Because this the metaphor for racism . When I walk into a party , you d think I was one of those long straight tetris pieces . Because everyone s just like , oh yeah , this guy s here . Finally , we ve been waiting for him to show up . Like , you wait in the game , forget it . No , you had your chance . Why ? If I had a million dollars , I d pay your mother to have sex with me . Afterwards , I d probably invest the remaining 999 , 990 . 10 for sex with your mother , comedy . I smell comedy . Well , he was comedy giving off that scent . And finally , mid October , with leaves spilled like colored pencil shavings , the streets dicing our town into neat , unfair portions . And me eating that pussy , baby . Thank you so much . There s things that I don t want to come across in my show that I worry often come across about me . Because people don t realize that it s an act up here . I don t want you to ever think that I think I m better than people , or that I think I know better than people . Anyway , sorry . Okay . This is a song from the perspective of God . The books you think I wrote are way too thick . Who needs a thousand metaphors to figure out you shouldn t be a dick ? And I don t watch you when you sleep . Surprisingly , I don t use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep . You re not going to heaven . Why the fuck would you think I d ever kick it with you ? None of you are going to heaven . There s a trillion aliens cooler than you . You shouldn t abstain from rape just because you think that I want you to . You shouldn t rape because rape is a fucked up thing to do . Pretty obvious . Just don t fucking rape people . Do you think I d to write that one down for you ? I don t think masturbation is obscene . It s absolutely natural , and the weirdest fucking thing I ve ever seen . You make my job a living hell . I send gays to fix over population . Boy did Pat Coel . You re not going to heaven . Eat a thousand crackers , sing a million hymns . None of you are going to heaven . You re not my children . You re a bad game of sin . You shouldn t abstain from pork just because you think that I want you to . You can eat pork . Why the fuck would I give a shit ? I created the universe . I think I m drawn the line at the fucking deli aisle . You are you and you pick her and you fight . Atheists and Catholics , choosing Hindus , argue day and night . Over what they think is true . But no one entertains the thought that maybe God does not believe in you . </s> <s> You pray so badly for heaven . Knowing any day might be the day that you die . But maybe life on earth could be heaven . Doesn t just the thought of it make it worth a try . My love s the type of thing that you have to earn it when you earn it . You won t need it . Oh , my love s the type of thing that you have to earn it when you earn it . You won t need it . I m not going to give you love just because I know that you want me to . If you want love then the love has got to come from you . Welcome to my performance . Tell me about it . Women are stupid . Yeah , I fucking said it . The weaker , dumber , sex . I can prove it to you . I like to practice safe sex . Why ? Because I m a guy and I m smarter . What do women say every time ? Every time I put on a condom . Why are you wearing a condom if I m fucking you with a strap on ? It s time for a story . Let s do a story . It s time for a story . It s time for a story . A very special story especially for you . It s time for a story . It s time for a story . Sit down and listen now . Don t be a Jew . This story is called Andy . That s a glitch . You can be Jewish . This story . This story is called Andy the Frog featuring long and convoluted similes . Now warn you when one of those long convoluted similes rears its old head . So here we go . Once upon a time there was a frog named Andy . Andy lived at the patent park pond and never hopped anywhere else in his entire frog life . He had three best friends . Millie , who never left her lily pad . Billy , who was always hopping mad . And Roger , who was the rest of the possession of tadpole porn . So one day . One day . Andy saw something hop across the grass on the other side of the pond . Millie , Billy , Roger . Look at Andy . Across the pond stood the most beautiful frog Andy had ever seen . She s gorgeous said Millie . She s beautiful said Billy . But all for my taste said Roger , classic Roger . And then she was gone . I need to go find her , Savannah . I need to follow my little frog heart . So Andy followed the beautiful frog s footsteps into the forest . He then came across a turtle . You can t pass said the turtle . Please said Andy . No , said the turtle . And this is the first long convoluted simile . Then there was a rustling in the bushes and like a man would have been shot in the chest with a rifle . The turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle . </s> <s> Andy kept moving . But at this point , like the doctor of the Kenyan track team , his patients ran thin . Andy kept moving . He then came across a giant crocodile and the crocodile began to chant . I woke up this morning and I sat on a log . I opened up the menu . The menu said frog . And he said , no , no , please let go of me . I can feel myself dying . You re ripping out my insides . I m never going to find her . Am I ? There s no God is there . Fuck , fuck . The end . So the end of that story . Yeah . If you re curious , the moral of that story is irrelevant because we re humans . Why would it apply to us ? My father is so hard to get along with because he s such a man s man . He believes , for example , you should always fight fire with fire , which is a horrible way to live your life . Especially for him because he s a firefighter . So he was fired . That was as stupid as we get . But let s get a little stupider , huh ? There s a creepy old man fishing in the park and the only problem is he tied a candy bar to the end of his line . He s trying to catch a kid . You know , that stuff . Trying to get a little more mainstream . People complain about the way act on stage very often . They say like I repeat jokes . Or they also say that they don t get , again , that this is an act on stage . And they think on stage I act to arrogant , to self obsessed , solipsistic , self contained synonyms . And they want me to be a comic of the people . You know , relate to the people with the overarching glue of comedy . So I want to do a little bit of relatable comedy for you guys . I m like you guys , you know , once a week I like to slip into a deep ex distentioned oppression where I lose all my sense of oneness and self worth . And what I like to do in order to assure myself that I am unique , and not just one of many small white , indistinguishable , perfectly cylindrical checkerpieces , and Jesus and Satan s backgammon game , is I will . . . I ll say a group of words that I think no one has ever said in that order , so that when I say it , I feel like , look at me participating in this new moment that no one has ever been a part of . So I ll say something random like , like peanut butter , trivetism , or I m your father , and I love your comedy show . </s> <s> Or at first I wasn t comfortable leaving him alone with my children , but then I saw his mustache , few . Or , uh . . . Or yo , check out the Sommage website . Or , um . . . Or I work at a toll booth , and I don t want to kill myself . Or that s too real . Or yo , man , my life s about three things , man , three things , getting money , getting pussy , and the two week decimal system . Or , uh . . . Or hey , can you hold my fanny pack ? I m gonna go fuck a woman . Yeah . Um , if I could break . . . I want to thank you all for being here , because , uh . . . I mean , I m so grateful that you d all come here and spend an hour of your time with me , and if you re watching it , home or whatever on a computer or something , uh . . . if you ve made it this far , thank you very much for watching . Genuinely , this is my favorite thing to do , and I m so grateful for people watching it and enjoying it . Um . . . Okay . I will now receive back into my stage persona . I just blacked out for 20 seconds . Thank you for coming . Love songs used to be so beautiful . You know , let us go then , you and I , when the evening is spread out against the sky , like a patient , it thrives upon a table , T . S . Eliot beautiful . Love songs nowadays , just as beautiful guys . Usher Justin Bieber , 1D , you know them . But these new artists , they ve done something very strange to the format of the love song . They ve changed it a bit . And I tried to capture how they ve changed the format of the love song . With this love song , I hope you enjoy it , and mark the differences . J . S . Andreulo . I love your hair , I love your name , I love the way you say it . I love your heart and you re so smart , because you gave away it . I love your sis , I love your dad , I love your mum . But more than all of that , I love the fact that you are dumb enough . To not realize everything I ve said has been said before , in a thousand ways , in a thousand songs . Song with the same four chords , but you ll still love it , and let me finger you . Yeah , I think you re right . I m not going to say it , but I m not going to say it . I m not going to say it , but I m not going to say it . Yeah , I think you re right . Oh girl , I hope you don t think that I m rude . When I tell you that I love you , boo , I also hope that you don t see through . </s> <s> This cleverly constructed ruse , designed by a marketing team , caching in on puberty and low self esteem , and girls desperate needs to feel loved in . America says we love a chorus , but don t get complicated and bore us , no meaning might be missing . We need to know the words after just one listens , a repeat step , repeat step , repeat step , repeat step , repeat step , repeat step , repeat step , repeat step , yeah , oh , you know it . I love my baby , and you know I couldn t live without her , but now I need to make every girl think the song s about her , that they spread it like the plague , so I describe my dream . Girl is really , really vague , like , I love your hands because your fingerprints are like no other . I love your eyes and their bluish brownish greenish color . I love it when you smile , that you smile wide , and I love how your torso has an arm on either side now . If you re my agent , you might be thinking , oh no , sound the alarm , you re not appealing . It s a little girl who don t have arms , but they get used to it and so , fuck a moon needs up . Oh girl , oh , oh , oh , hello , Satan . Oh . Oh . Oh , oh , oh , oh , Satan , you re taste so , yeah . Repeat step , repeat step , repeat step , repeat step , repeat step , repeat step , everybody . Be the least of me . Come on louder , I can t hear you . Be the least of me , the least of me , the least of me . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Young ones , listen up . I m in magazines full of model teens so far above you . So read them and hate yourself , then pay me to tell you I love you . And your parents will always come along , because their little girl is in love , and how could love be run ? How could love be run ? When you repeat step , repeat step , repeat step , repeat step , repeat step . I m a bastard ! I m a bastard ! I m a bastard ! I m a bastard ! I m a human audio . I m a human audio . I m a human audio . We know it s not right . We know it s not funny , but we ll stop beating this dead horse when it stops been now money . But until then , we will repeat stuff . Thank you so much . You guys have been absolutely amazing . That s the end of the show . I probably should have ended it on a sort of higher note there . Yeah , that s the end of what ? </s> <s> I hope you liked it .

You can play some songs for us or something . I ve been telling everybody how good a friend we were back in the day . I know we never talked or hung out ever . But I think that s what made our friendships so special . Anyway , take me . Okay , bye . Mr . Burnham , how you doing ? Good . I m an agent from out in Los Angeles . Really dig your stuff man . It s out there . I totally get it . And the best part about it , man , you got all these young fans . Which is great because young people , they re very passionate and they re very reliable consumers . But what you got to do in order to take your career to the next level , you got to cater more heavily to them . We ve done studies . Young people do not respond to this introspective material or these challenges of the form . Young people want jokes they can relate to . Okay , so write a silly song about Facebook . Write some jokes about Twitter or sugary serials or razor scooters . Relate to them . You know , also you got to reestablish your presence on the internet , buddy . It s not important whether the material is good or not . What s important is that you keep the bow burnham brand alive and well . You get it ? Well , discuss more later . I know it s a lot . My number is 310 555 . Man , how s your hands ? Fag . What about you ? What s up ? How are you , man ? You ve changed , bro . You ve changed . I never knew you .

You think you re better than us ? You think you re better than us just because you re tall ? Well , congrats , man . You re tall . Wow , it s incredible . You want a trophy for being tall ? You want to , we should just give trophies to tall things and every tree and building will have a trophy . Does that make sense ? Yo , why are you actually not quiet and weird right now ? Yo , I know why you are . It s because you re an arrogant prick . That s why an arrogant , fucking prick . I once heard that you actually act quiet because you re shy and introverted in real life and that people shouldn t expect you to act the same way offstage as you do onstage . </s> <s> Yeah , yeah , that makes no sense .

And I do not have a problem with gay people . Everyone can do their own thing . In fact , I m trying to make it in Hollywood . I live in LA . Why not get one of those gay roles ? Who cares , right ? Pays a million bucks . Would you blame me if I m a millionaire ? Just because I can look gay easy ? That s a talent , OK ? That s a talent . All I got to do to look gay is turn my wrist out . Not everyone can do that . I better own that shit . You know what I mean ? Look , all I got to do to look gay is wrist out . </s> <s> Look , straight . What just happened , right ? That was nothing for me , right ? How did I do it ? I don t even know . I just went from my B year ass time . I touched it . Which way s home depot ? Where are the home depots ? Now a lot of guys are jealous of me . They re like thinking right now . You know what ? You re with your girl . Maybe you re like , I don t look gay that easy . How am I going to make it in Hollywood ? Well , I can teach you . Let s just do a little acting class . You guys want to do a little acting class ? Let s do it . Right ? What s your name , sir ? Jeff , you re a manly looking dude . You don t look gay as easy as me . I know you re jealous . And by the way , Jeff , beautiful girl , high five to you right now , dating way out of your league . Good for Jeff , man . That s bad . Good for him . My advice to you , Jeff , manly looking dude , all right ? You re going to go wrist out . It s not going to work . So what you need to do , look for imaginary bumblebees . Just right here . And swat it . You re halfway there , all right ? Now , one thing you re going to notice is gay people never look straight people . We look the way we walk , right ? Gay people look the opposite way . They re walking . So work on that whichever way they re walking , they re looking the wrong way . Have you noticed that shit ? Have you noticed ? Just trying to help you guys in Hollywood . That s what I m trying to do in case you move . In case you move . Man , but I appreciate you guys laughing . I m going to get out of here pretty quick . But you know what ? I was just in the island having a little vacation . I want to do some comedy . So give it up for yourselves real quick . Everybody , thank you very much . Thank you , thank you , thank you . Thanks God you are here . Thanks God for you . And I m sick of people thinking Kavon is a black name . It s a Persian name . But you know what s cool when black women hear my name , they get excited . They re like , your name Kavon ? That s your name Kavon ? Anything else about you , black ? I m always like , nope . Unfortunately not . But I learned a vital statistic . I want every guy to learn this . OK , every guy needs to learn this . I read a study . Women know in the first minute of meeting a guy if they re going to sleep with them , according to the University of Boston . </s> <s> One minute , women got it down . That s amazing . One minute . But I hate when girls get cocky about it . That s not cool . Yeah , that s right . We know in one minute , ladies , every guy in here has got your beat by 59 and a half seconds . I just want you to know that right now . Men are decision makers . We don t need the whole minute . We re looking at girls going , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes . If it s no , Patron , now that shit is yes again . We re going to get to yes . And that s what we do . You guys are great . I m cave on . Enjoy your headline or bread . William , I ll see you on Twitter . Good night , everybody . Bye bye . Bye bye . All right . Now , do I get the pleasure of introducing them or does someone else want to bring them out ? You want to bring them out ? This guy put on the show . Give it up for him , bringing comedy to the surf . Yeah , hopefully . Well , ladies and gentlemen , you all ready for the headline or Mr . Brad Williams , Comedy Central . Just got back from doing tour with the military and ladies and gentlemen . I was a Coast Guard rescue swimmer , and I came back home to Hawaii to do my GI Bill and make stuff like this happen . So without further ado , I give you Brad Williams . Oh , yeah . That was some good shit . Thank you , Eric . Hey , keep going for Eric , everyone . And keep on for cave on . How funny is cave on , everybody ? I jumped . That was skill right there . I jumped up . That was circ to Mijet . OK , that was some amazing shit . How the fuck am I going to get down ? Oh , he grabbed . I mean , Hawaii . This is awesome . I love being here , but it s scary . Because I m a little person . And why you guys got some mowens ? Fuck that . No , no , too big . Too big . No , someone came up to me today because we re like , hey , we actually have a mimo in Mijet on the island . I was like , hell , yeah . I want a meter . I did . She was 5 8 . That s a samo in Mijet . OK , that s it . She s looking at me . Eki , weeki , wee the same . What the fuck is wrong with you ? It s like Jabba the Hut trying to hit on me . This is insane . And then I went surfing . That was crazy . You guys go surfing ? Oh my god . So much fun . Yeah . Went surfing over in Waikiki . They have been in I was surfing . And literally , the whole beach stopped . And looked at me because you re like , it s a Mijet surfing . Oh my god . This is the , like , they re like making wishes and shit . </s> <s> Just like , all right . This is awesome . Mijet surfing . What are my lottery numbers again ? They re just going . So they re all staring at me . Meanwhile , I can t make this up . Ask some of the locals . There s a dog surfing in Waikiki , a fucking dog . OK ? And I know the Asians are like , oh , delicious . Not that type . Not that type . Stay away from Bawau . OK ? Don t do that . So , but there s a dog surfing . No one s staring at the fucking dog . Nobody . And I m like , dude , that s like , why is everyone staring at the Mijet surfing ? That s a dog . Everyone s like , oh , that s Randy . He s here all the time . What the fuck ? It s a dog surfing . They re like , yeah , you got two legs . You got four . No big deal . Are you kidding me ? How awesome is this ? They brought comedy to Turtle Bay at Resort . This is great . Hey , right ? And a great show , too . All the comedians have been great . You guys , no matter what your friends do , when they come to Hawaii , your story fucking wins . OK ? You understand that ? You just say , hey , I was at Turtle Bay , had a great time , and then Mijet told me jokes . Like , hey , you win . You win at that point . You do , because everyone s happy when they see a Mijet . Fucking everybody . Everybody . You re never upset when this comes around . OK ? Like , at all . You see this ? It s happy time right there . Like , what do you guys don t know who I am ? I don t know what TV shows have been on . But I walk on stage , you re like , this is going to be good . That s it . You know , Mijets are happiness . You can get fired from your job . Why don t your wife is blowing some other dude ? You walk down the street . You see me ? You re just . . . That s it . That s why I don t think we re using Mijets properly in this country . We re not . We have normal jobs . We shouldn t have normal jobs . They should just be giving Mijets to cancer patients . Right ? Think about that . How awesome . I m sorry , sir . I just go , do you have cancer ? Damn it . Here s your Mijet . Fuck yeah . I think outside the box of this stuff , I do . They want to know how to end the war in the Middle East . I know how . Obama , don t drop bombs . Drop dwarves . All right . Operation Willow Drop . Hand me a parachute . Let s go . Because what s the big problem ? We can t find all the terrorists . They re hiding in tiny caves . </s> <s> I ve fitting small spaces . I ll find them . I ll catch them in the middle of making those death tapes . They re like dead to the military , to the infidels . They build up the American pig . We ll run into him of a la . Ooh . Oh my god , you are cute . Come here . Come here , come here , come here , come here . Come here , come here , come here , come here , come here , come here , come here . How boo . How boo . Who s a little tally man ? You re a little tally man . It s funny . I m doing that voice and K 1 s like , my mother s calling me , right ? And by the way , that was a great joke , the Dutali bun . That s a great joke . It is , but don t ignore the message I put in that joke . That message being very clearly when you see me hanging out after the show , don t fucking pick me up . Okay , don t do that shit . I have to say that . I m 28 , I m a 28 year old man . I have to say don t pick me up . Cause when people see me , they don t see 28 . You look at me with the , whoo , puppy . It sucks . Cause I m adorable . It just happens , man . It just , like , this is not a joke . I get picked up . There s a , there s a video game store next to my house . It s called GameStop . I was there not too long ago . I was playing the new Mass Effect 3 , trying to get my skills up . This dude walks in the video game store . I ve never seen him before in my life . He s never met me . He sees me , starts freaking out . Oh my God . Oh my God . Ha ha ha . Why the fuck did he pick me up ? Why ? Well , he tried to reenact his favorite scene for the Lion King . Ha , the thing . Yeah . And the black guy was like , my mother is calling me . Ha ha ha . He picked me up . Why the fuck did he pick me up ? I m in a video game store . And he think I was like a brand new controller . Some shit . What does this button do ? That s my asshole . Get away from me . This isn t Penn State , the video game . You know what I mean ? All right , testing the audience on that one . Testing it . Some people , ha ha ha . I m not going to laugh at a Penn State joke . Listen , listen . If Penn State did not want me to make jokes about them , how about they just , oh , I don t know , not fuck kids . How about that ? Don t fuck kids . I don t make fun of you . That s the rule . It s not hard . We all did it today . We probably all walked by a kid on the beach with , wow . </s> <s> There s a kid . Don t want to fuck them . It s simple . It s real easy . Now I know I make the Penn State joke , but it wasn t like Penn State . It was that one dude , Jerry Sandusky . And don t get me wrong . I joke , but what happened was a tragedy . You can t ignore that . And the unfortunate thing was right after it happened at Penn State , the assistant coach at Syracuse got busted for touching kids . And right after that , the president of the AAU got busted for touching kids . All these so called responsible adults are touching kids . No one has a solution . We ve got to do something . We ve got to save our children . I have a solution . I have this , this will work . Here s what we do . We give the pedophiles gay midgets . Think about it . Think about it . Think about it . Who loses in that situation ? Fucking nobody loses in that situation . Nobody , not the kids . They re happy as hell , because they re not getting touched anymore . That s priority number one . And then the pedophiles , even the pedophiles are happy , because it s like , oh , you caught me . But he s 40 . It s good . Anyone who s the happiest people of all art ? The gay midgets . They re happiest shit , because they re getting laid . I have two gay midget friends , two . And they tell me all the time how hard it is for them to get laid . That boggles my mind , because if you look at me , if you look at what a little person is working with , I am a gay man s wet dream , okay ? I am everything a gay man would want . First of all , do the math in your head . I m the perfect height . So when you were lining it up right now , you re like , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , exactly , perfect height . Second of all , got small hands , make any cock look huge , okay ? See , right now , the Asian guy s like , even on me ? Yeah , even a U quang ping , okay ? That s how it works . Small hands , all right ? Everything looks big . Thirdly , and most important of all , why any gay man would want me , look at that ass . Okay , that is a fantastic ass , all right ? The black woman is jealous of my ass , okay ? You understand how good that , and it s got power behind it too . It s not a normal , it s pretty , it s a , it s a , it s a good shit . You put a wall up back there , solid , like it s how that works . You know , I said all those jokes , and now there s a straight guy in here going tempting . You see , I know this kind of messed up stuff , but this is the kind of , should I think about ? </s> <s> This comics were flying like eight to 10 hours every week , sitting by ourselves in an airplane . And I mean , the flight over here in the end of that batch , just six hours , it s good , it s non stop , you re fine . Or at least from Los Angeles where I m from , I had to fly to , oh , Richmond , Virginia , a couple of weeks ago , and something happened on my plane . Now , the pilot recognized me . New was a comedian , he comes out , he s like , hey , Brad , you re not gonna talk about this in your act , are you ? Thank you , fuck you , me as I am . And , but he told me that if I say the name of the airline , I can t , like he could actually sue me for a , looks , lander of the airline . So I told him I d make one up . So for the purposes of this joke , I was flying helltop . Airlines is , if I m jumping , I was flying helltop . I was talking about this piece of shit airline , all right ? I was talking about them . Here s what happened , okay ? Like I said , LA , hallelujah , great , great flight . And , but that s direct . LA doesn t fly direct to Richmond , Virginia . First , they put me on a nice big comfortable plane to Washington , DC , that was fine , I had no complaints . Then they put me on a plane to Richmond , Virginia . Now , I put that in quotes , because that was not a fucking plane , okay , that s not , it s not a plane , it s not a plane , it s just like a piece of paper , someone handy with Japanese kid who origami that shit , oh , look , plane , that s not a fucking plane , okay ? It s not a plane , if it doesn t have engines , and to make it go , there s hand to a black eye , who takes it , runs , the other runway , and goes , good luck for the fuck off , that s not a plane . So we re sitting on this tiny ass plane , and we re crammed in , and you know what s a tiny plane , if the mitchets going , wow , this is a tight ass space . Like , you know what I mean ? And we re sitting here , and we re not moving , we re delayed over an hour , but we re on the plane . We don t know why we re delayed . Then they come over the loudspeaker , tell us why we re delayed . Psh , ladies and gentlemen , we were agretto informed you , we have oversold this morning s flight , we are currently too heavy to fly . It is unsafe , and our current weight to fly , we miscalculate the strength of our engines , some of our passengers with flexible travel plans are gonna be asked to take a later flight . </s> <s> Yeah , they can do that , and they started asking if they had flexible travel plans . No one said yes , because , you know , they wanna get to their destination , wanna get home , whatever . But then me , I had flexible travel plans . My show wasn t until the next day , I was flying out a day early , so I was like , sure , I could use the miles . I ll get off the plane , I ll help everyone out . I got off the plane . I was the only one that got off the plane . Then the plane took off . If you re not laughing , you can t do math , okay ? You should work for the fucking airline , all right ? Do you understand what happened ? The plane was too heavy to fly , too heavy to fly . Unsafe it , that weight to fly . One digit gets off the plane . Then you take off , fuck you , healthy airlines . What the hell is wrong with you ? I was praying for a plane crash that day , okay ? I was , I wanted you to do all that , what the , you kicked me off , because I had flexible travel plans . Plans don t crash , because of flexible travel plans . They crashed , wait , okay , that s why they crashed . Why did they kick me off the plane when there was a perfectly good fat woman sitting three rows behind me , and there was , oh , this is a big bitch . She was pushing three bills , and we all knew she was there , because when they said , do heavy to fly , we all looked at her like , well , we know who s fault , this is what it is . Did she get off the plane ? No . Kicked and meagled it out , and listen . I don t like , it pains me to tell this story , because I like to think of myself as someone who gets along with everyone , you can get along with all people , but fuck , fat people are pissing me off recently . You know what ? I should clarify , some fat people , okay , some , not all , not all , because there s different types of fat people , and many types are good people . Many types are good outstanding people . Like , if you re a fat , but you care yourself in a positive manner , you re like , fuck it , I m fat , I don t give a shit , I m gonna have fun , I love you , okay , I fucking love you . Have a good attitude about it , no matter what your condition is . Like , if you re a fat dude , and you re a favorite thing to do , is just run into a crowded elevator , look around and start jumping . Ah , that s a shit , good for you . And , if you re a fat woman , if you re a fat woman , do not think for one second that you are not sexy , okay ? Don t think that about yourself . Don t try to live up these impossible standards of beauty that our society puts upon you , no . </s> <s> Sometimes it s a metabolic thing , sometimes you can t lose weight , sometimes it s a genetic thing . The only thing is ladies just be confident with yourself . Be confident , walk out of that house , going , I am a 60 bitch , you know what I mean ? I don t care , I don t care how fat you are . Walk out of that thing going , yeah , I might be fat , but I can suck a dick better than any skinny whore out there . You know what I mean ? What do that ? Do that , and you ll have a better life . Listen , I am four foot nothing , four foot nothing , okay ? Did you see the woman I walked in with ? Holy shit , I do not deserve that , okay ? I don t , but I m confident as hell , I am confident as hell , because she knows it , I don t tap that pussy , I m any packing out of that pussy . Okay , I don t give a shit . I don t care , so fat women have that man , have that confidence . Walk out of that , I m the shit . Who cares what people think ? Order a second piece of cheesecake , who gives a fuck , and be thankful because at the other night , you know what black guy s gonna hit on you . Or some hoe into it , everything . You can wake up , you go home with me . Exactly , so those are the good types of fat people . Now , don t be the type of fat person , it just complains , it just sits there , oh my life s stuck , what can I do ? I don t know how it happened . I could give you one fucking guess how it happened . No , I didn t listen . It s not a skinny person s job to help you , you gotta help yourself . The same way , it s not a tall person s job to help me . It s not , and I m getting some flack over this . There s a group of little people called LPA , little people of America . They want me to be a spokesman for a law , they want to get past . I don t like the law , here s the law . It s a law that says , if past every ATM in our country should be lowered by a foot , I don t want that to be how to pass , because yeah , it d be great for me , but in every single time one of you guys walks up to an ATM , you ll walk up and be like , fucking Midgets . You re gonna be mad . You re gonna see me and go , it was him . I don t want that , don t worry , I can get my money , I m good , I jump . BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP I m good . So fat people , help yourself , okay ? Help yourself , I don t know what happened . </s> <s> No , cause then you complain too much , and then sometimes we have politicians dumbing up to listen , like in California , where I m from , where in California , you re never gonna believe this , in California , there s a law that says that if you are fat , it is perfectly legal for you to park in a handicapped parking space . Yes , yes , they call it morbid obesity , I am sorry fat people , fuck you , fuck you fat people , it is not your parking space , that is not your parking space . That is my parking space , dammit . That is my parking space . I have to park there because it makes me 9 , 000 steps to match every one of your fat asses , that s right at the park there , you re fat , if the lose weight , we should make you park 72 blocks away , then you can burn some calories and walk your fat ass or asses away . Some of you want to clap , but you can t , you re saying next to a fat ass right now , I don t give a shit . Brad , he s fat , he s gonna get mad , it doesn t matter , he s fat , you re thin , you can run faster . Ugh . Just have a good attitude about it , laugh with it , don t come onto me after Brad , you shouldn t make fun of obesity , Brad , because Brad obesity is a disease , disease , Brad . Exactly , fuck no , it s not . And I ll prove it to you , because I ve never ever once put on a condom because I was scared of catching fat . All right , I haven t done it . But Brad , you can at least say it s a disability , right ? It s a disability , no , obesity s not a disability , the word disability break it down , that word means without ability , that s what word means . That means the person who has that particular affliction had no choice in the matter of what happened to them , what their condition is , I m sorry fat people , you had a little bit of a choice , you did , you did a little bit of a choice , you could have chosen to put down the Big Mac , okay , you could have chosen that , because the Big Mac did not run up your leg and rape your mouth , okay , that shit did not happen . Somebody got to take in the shit way too seriously , okay , this is , these are jokes , don t think I m trying to start a rally or nothing , I don t wanna like run outside the hotel and start laughing fat people with lap bands or shit like that , I don t want that , no . It s how fun , it s a comedy show . We make it fun to people , okay , if I m made fun of people , I don t make fun of people , that s our job , I m a comedian , ha ha , okay , that s it . </s> <s> Just know that if we haven t made fun of you yet , just wait , we ll get there . And just know that every time you get offended at a joke , think about this , there is someone who has their situation way worse than you , who is not offended by that joke and who is laughing at that joke , okay , so just , it s just a very good joke , no , someone has it worse and someone s laughing , perved example , I didn t show a couple weeks ago , dude came to my show , now he was in a wheelchair and he sat in the front row , now I wasn t gonna fuck with him because he s cool , he s in the front row , he s gonna see a show , but then his wife came in and the wife was hot as hell , like a 10 , and at that point I m like , I m fucking with him , and you know what I mean , like you have to at that point , and gross , you would , oh , no , don t go off , you have to understand this , men , if we re with a 10 , if we re with a hot woman , they re ain t jack shit , you can say to us , that s gonna piss us off , you can t , it s impossible , try it , why don t you a guy with a fucking perfect 10 and go , hey man , you fucking suck , I m with her . Yeah , I bet you have a tiny dick , it goes in her . You re fine , trust me dude , I know this , I know this , look at the girl I brought tonight , she s gorgeous , I walked that street with her , just holding hands , just walking on the street , just like holding hands , like just like that , that s my bo And when we walk , people walk up like , okay , what happened here , he s either really funny or really rich , or it s his make a wish . Ah ! Ah ! Wow , if you didn t like that joke , there s one coming , you re gonna fucking hate it . Anyway , but like , I know that , so the guy came in , he had the hot wife , I m like , dude , you re in a wheelchair , you re in a hot wife , fucking awesome , good for you . Now we always in the wheelchair , did she meet you before , did it happen after , no , I m asking them , and then I asked them if he had special things installed in his house to help him with his daily life , I have things like that in my house to help me out , so I was curious , but then I was just doing this to get to the real question . Yeah , some of you guys are sick fucks like me , you re laughing because you already know what the question was , yeah . </s> <s> Yeah , he s in a wheelchair , he s with a 10 , how do they have sex , right ? And I asked him that , I m like , flood out , how do you guys have sex ? I don t know , I don t know how that works . I ve seen a lot of porno in my day , I have never ever once seen the wheelchair porno , okay ? I don t know . What has to happen is the girl is kinda like , Loubub , lay down , spread eagle , the guy s kinda like wheel up to her like that , and wheel back away from her like that , like wheel back up to her like that , like wheel back away from her like that . Maybe he s got one of those automatic wheelchairs , just me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me . Oh , I kept doing all the wheelchair versions of that shit , but see , I told that joke in front of him , and when I did , no one in the audience was laughing , except the man in the wheelchair . He was dialing , and I m looking , I m like , dude , why is this so funny ? And he looks up , me and goes , cause that s how we do it . Yes . I go , really ? That s how you guys have sex , and I swear to you guys , he looks at me and goes , yep , that s how I roll . Get the fuck out of here . You can t write this shit , but you see that moment happen . And the reason why that moment happened is because I talked to him , because the worst thing you could do to anyone who has a disability or difference is ignore that person , don t do it . The multiverse , talk to us , say what s up , say what s going on . If you have questions about our condition , ask us , because we can give you the real answer . Don t do what some parents do , and just hide their kids , and the kids sees me , he s going to do it . He s going to do it . He ll hide their kids , and the kid sees me . He wants to say something , he s freaking out . Like , I m going to fucking run with him . And then the parent goes on a parent panic , and they re like , oh , then they say something dumb . He didn t eat his vegetables . And it s fucking out . You laugh , I ve seen that . So talk to us , because if you don t talk to us , ignorance builds up , and if ignorance builds up , you will say something stupid in your life , okay ? You will . Not too long ago , I did a show . Great show . This dude comes up to me after the show . He tried to give me a compliment . He tried , but it just came out fucked up . </s> <s> He tried . He was a good heart . He walks up , goes , oh my God , Brad , you were funny as hell , dude , that was great . And what a coincidence , you re a little person . My best friend is retarded . I know , I m like , dude , it s not the same thing . It s not even close to the same thing . We park in the same space , but it s not the same thing . I park there , because I can t reach the windows . He parks there , because he licks the windows . That s the average shit . Don t let ignorance build up . If you do ignorance in rare occasions could actually lead into fear . Now I found this out recently . There are actually people in this country who are clinically afraid of little people , okay ? Clinically , like not just , hey , that s kind of creepy . More like what the fuck is that , okay ? It s , yes , it s clinging . And by the way , one of these people is Rosie O Donnell . Yes , she said on her show , she was interviewing Chelsea Handler , and she said , you have a little person on your show . That s weird to me , because I m afraid of little people . They re kind of creepy looking . All right , bitch . All right , you think we re creepy looking ? But you think we re creepy looking ? You re a lesbian , you force another woman to eat your fat snatch , and I m creepy looking ? Fuck you , you ignorant cunt . Are you serious ? You are making another woman go down on the pit of Sarlaq from Return of the Fucking Jedi , and I m creepy looking ? Go fuck yourself . Okay . But it happens . It s real . I encountered this firsthand . I was doing a show in Denver , Colorado , okay ? I m doing the show , and there s a group of friends who came to my show , and one of their friends was afraid of little people . So they did what a good friend would do , and they sat her in the front row . It did not tell her who the comedian was that nice . Oh yeah , it didn t tell me either . I could have used a little heads up in that situation . You know what I mean ? So I m there , and before I even say one joke , this woman stands up , and from a sold out audience , just yells out , Jesus Christ ! Now , I don t know why she s freaking out . So I m looking around , like , is Tim Tibo here ? Like , and then she yells at me . She s like , I m afraid of you . And it s like , why ? How could you be afraid of , I don t get it . I don t get it , you can be afraid of this , okay ? It s not contagious . All right , I can t walk up to you bite your knee , and you go , hi , melting , and that doesn t happen . </s> <s> So I asked her , I said , why are you afraid of little people ? She gave me an answer . Now , her answer is the only time , in nine years of doing comedy , I froze on stage . Froze , I had no response . I m gonna tell you what she said , and just know that I m quoting her . I m not exaggerating , I m not putting a comedic spin on it . This is what she said . I go , why are you afraid of little people ? She stands up and goes , Brad , I m just afraid of little people . Because whenever I see one , I just know you re gonna rape me . Oh , yeah , real easy to bring the funny after that little bit . It wasn t it . Are you kidding me ? She thought I was gonna rape her ? I just looked there , I froze , I m like , how ? Because that can t happen . That can t happen , ladies , that is impossible . It s impossible . It is impossible for a midget to rape you , okay ? Impossible , yeah , impossible . So you re like , that s bullshit , Brad , that s bullshit . My cousin was raped by a midget . No , no , no . That was not a midget , that was a Puerto Rican . Here s different , here s different . Now , ladies , if you re in the audience right now and you are fearing midget rape , you are actually scared of it . Let me tell you , there is one move you can do . One move you can do that stops all forms of midget rape works 100 of the time , here s the move . Hey , that s it . Some of you waiting for something else , no , that s it . That s all palm forehead , bam . I m like , you do that , I m stuck , wave it up . Now , let s save for one second . I actually get past the magical anti midget rape move , okay ? Let s say I bust out like a little football joker , some shit . I still can t do anything to you . I can t , ladies , think about it . Our stuff does not line up , all right ? It doesn t , my stuff down there , your stuff should be about like there is , you know ? What can I do ? Like , hey , get down here , get down here , get the fuck down here . I m fine , I m shit . I got a little applause on that midget rape joke , all right . I m liking this , you got your sick fuckers . Good . I don t know what it is about Hawaii . I don t know if it s like the vacation aspect of it , the fact that a lot of you are away from wherever your home is , but people go fucking crazy here . </s> <s> I love it , I love that shit . Let s go on afterward , let s just go and eat spam . What the hell is it ? It s really shoulder , right ? It s shoulder , you guys are eating like , like you re eating that , but people eat it because it s book delicious , okay ? It s delicious , now here s the thing . If you ve never had spam before , your stomach might not be used to it , let me warn you guys , because I ve found out the hard way , if you eat spam , you immediately have to take a shit . All right , it s immediate , like normally your ass gives you that count down like T minus 10 minutes and counting . Not spam , you eat that , it s go time ! Like you gotta do it , yesterday I had some spam . I immediately had to go to the hotel bathroom over here . So you guys might have seen it , there s a toilet right there . Now , here s the thing , when I m in a public bathroom , right ? My legs , they dangle , right ? They dangle , oftentimes they don t even dangle below the door . No one even knows I m in the fucking bathroom . Dude , I love doing phantom farts , that s the best . People think they re by themselves , all of a sudden they hear whoooo , like that , they start freaking out , what the hell was that ? Why does it smell like Skittles ? Dwarfarts , smell like Skittles , you know ? They do , yeah . Here s a gay guy in here right now going , I wanna take the rainbow . Ah ! So , so I m there in the bathroom , doing my thing , right ? Now , this guy walks in , he goes to the urinal , and he does his thing , but as he s walking out , he thought he was by himself , so turns off the light . I know ! I m looking , like what the fuck am I supposed to do ? I can t do anything , and I was telling the story to Eric , and Eric s like , dude , you should just read the toilet paper . Dick , I can t , I can t , I have a crocodile arms . Okay , I can t read the fucking toilet paper . I have tiny arms , alright , a T Rex looks at my arms and goes , that s fucked up . It s insane . It s not , I have tiny arms . Here s the proof you why I m tiny arms . Look at this shit , first of all , they don t straighten . They don t straighten , that s my arm straightening , right ? Look , can t go straight , and that sucks , because that means when I m standing straight up , I can t masturbate . </s> <s> Look at that shit , look at that , that s real , that s real . I can t fake that , can t touch my dick , can t do it . Nothing I can do , I can do it . Eric s Tarship , like that , I m like , nothing . You re laughing , because you know if I was a black ninja , I can masturbate , you know that . You know that . So I m there , I m doing my thing , I m panicking , it s dark . I don t know what to do . Then I get a text message on my phone , and my phone lights up . I m like , ha , light . So I get the phone , and my pants like that , and I click it , that light . So now I hop down , but I can t pull up my pants yet for obvious reasons , right ? Yeah , so I got my pants down , my phone s out , I m walking on the bathroom , like I m like , measuring any other Jones or something like that . And then I finally get up to the light switch , and I m flicking on , and the second I do , another dude walks into the bathroom , and yeah , and you see naked midget right in front of them . Life does not prepare you for naked midget , alright ? I don t care who you are , you can be a badass , you can be army , navy , Marines , Air Force , Coast Guard . It doesn t matter , you see naked midget , you free . So he s frozen , I m frozen , we both know what to do , but I m a comic . I said the first thing that pops into my head , I go , hey ! Are you my 330 ? Because you know that guy ran home , fellas , friends ! Holy shit ! You gotta go to the turtle bay , they got midget prostitutes in the bathroom ! And afterward they give you a Mahalo ending . I don t know , I got the word wrong , whatever . Oh man , oh this has been a crazy night . I didn t know what to expect , like , let you guys , like , let you guys just come in here and kind of quiet , and no one s kind of a bar situation , not doing comedy , but honest to God , no bullshit . You guys are one of the best fucking crowds ever performing in front of you guys . You guys are great . And if you re here , and you drove from Waikiki or Honolulu , fuck it , thank you man . Thanks for driving out here , and I do appreciate it . So now we re all , we got good positive energy going , we got a lot of people in the room , we got dancing after work , we got good drinks , so that means some people are gonna get laid tonight . Okay , yes , oh fuck , yeah , absolutely , look , Martin , too , mama wants it right there , mama wants it , I m good for you . </s> <s> Here s the thing , if you re gonna have sex tonight , I want it to be good sex , okay ? I don t want you to see my show , then I m bad sex , then every time you see me , you re gonna be like , asshole , I had bad sex , you know what I mean ? Let s make sure it s good . Now , ladies , you can help us all out in this situation , because yes , absolutely ladies , because you ve got to tell your man , you ve got to tell your man , if you want to have good sex ladies , you want to have that orgasm , tell your man exactly what we need to do to make you come , okay ? Exactly , exactly , to the T , don t be like , oh just do whatever you want to do , no , fuck , no , don t do that shit . Instructions , okay , we will follow them , alright ? Don t just do what you normally do , and look at your pussy like it s a Rubik s Cube , like , solve that one , fuck her , and it s not bad . Stop it . Don t do it , give us some shit . I don t know , why do you do that , ladies ? Why do you think it s easy for us ? It s not easy for us , maybe it s because it s easy for you , maybe because it s easy to fuck a dude as a woman , because every dude wants the same thing , we all do , that s a matter where you go . We can go out here in one of the locals , and be like , who , who , who , I want a blowjob ? You know , it s the same shit , we can go up and down south , like , I tell you what , I want a blowjob . Same shit , we can go to Africa , and be like , I m a , I m a , blowjob . That s the same shit . It s so easy , as a woman , fucking a dude is like walking into an IKEA with an Alan Ritz going , oh my god , this works on everything . Talk to us , because every vagina is different , ladies , understand that ? We go in there , like , alright , I can solve this , I can crack this safe , 17 , 25 , 34 , bullshit , sorry . You gotta tell us , but a lot of women don t , they let us do it wrong , don t do it . Ladies , if you , and a lot of excuses I hear are the same thing where it s just like , Brad , oh my god , if I told my man what I really wanted in bed , I would scare him . Try it . Try it , try to scare your man , can t happen , possible , not gonna happen . Ladies , you could look back in the middle of sex and say the creepiest shit of all time . Your man s not gonna flinch . You would look back and be like , oh yeah , tonight call me by your mama s name . </s> <s> Alright , Susan , let s do this shit , I don t care . We don t care . And I know this , because I want , a woman once thought she could scare me , okay , me . At one time , I got this girl back , she might tell her , while I m back , things are going good , you know , she got my hands are going downstairs , grabs my hand like , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . Not tonight . Oh my god , I m so sorry , why ? I didn t shave . And , that s not gonna stop me . That s not gonna stop any man , ladies , no man , no man , I don t care if it s one of the young bucks or old dude right here , no man , no man , you think this guy is gonna stop Because of that shit , no man in the history of pussy Has ever gotten woman home , got the pants off , got the panties off Saw a big bush , he was like , whoa ! I am not fucking that tonight ! It s never happened , ever ! I wouldn t have cared if another midget hopped out of the bush for a god s sacks ! I ll look down like dude , you re here , threesome Pfft ! Exactly . Talk to us ladies ! Let us know ! Don t just sit there like it s easy . Oh Brad , you should just know . Move to do that sometimes . Brad , you should just know . Man should just know how to make woman come . It s so easy , it s so basic . All you gotta do is work your way up from toe to head . That s it , work your way up , toe to head . Start off , keep your little foot massage right there . Keep me in the mood . Then you gotta work your way up , rub the back of my knee pit . That s the sensitive . Then you gotta eat me out for about seven and a half minutes . No more , no less . Shit , my kid messy . It can t work your way up . You gotta grab my right , titty , real firm . Grab my left to the little softer . You gotta lick my left nipple and account of clockwise formation . I said counterclockwise , not clockwise . That s for hores . Eh , keep work way up . We start making out my neck a little bit . Start kissing me , lick my ear , grab my hair , bend me over . Fuck me , doggy style . Right before you are about to come , you punch me in the back of the head . We want to do that , ladies . We want that . Every man in this room wants to throw in a little donkey punch every now and then . But we re not going to just guess that you like that . No man , the first time he has sex with a woman just cocks back like , hope she likes this shit . </s> <s> No . Some guys didn t think I knew what a donkey punch was , did you ? I know that shit . Gotta expand yourselves . Sexually , you gotta talk about it . Have communication , ladies . Tell us what you want . But at the same time , I understand why you don t . I know the real reason why you don t tell your man what you want specifically sexually . Because you know that your man has an ego . And you know that if you tell your man , hey , baby , tonight , don t try this move . Instead , try this move . Your man is a thing . All right , cool , a new move for my woman . No , your man thinks , well , who the fuck did that move right before I did ? It s stupid , ladies . I know it is . And it s childish . I apologize . So we can agree that both men and women are to blame in this situation . But it doesn t mean we can t rectify it . Okay ? We got it . We got to have a compromise . A way for men to get better at sex without women had to tell us what to do . Now , I have a solution . All right ? Video games . Yeah . All the Asians got excited . I was so fucking funny . Like , oh , he ll get it . Yeah , exactly . It s great . Guys , learn things now because of video games . I have never played in the NFL . I know what a cover to defense is because I play Madden . I know basic military weaponry and strategy because I play games like Metal of Honor , Call of Duty , Bout Feel 3 . I know shit . There s men in this room right now who think they can play guitar ? Yeah , right ? Guitar hero . Great game guitar hero . They hand you a controller , shaped like a guitar . You re putting buttons up here . Course violent music on your TV . Get the notes at the right time as music on your TV . You get points . Awesome . Let s point that in the right direction . We don t need guitar hero . We need pussy hero . Right ? How bad ass would pussy hero be ? Just pussy hero . Level one . Four play . Choose your weapon . This is so hot . She s going to rub one out right now in the bathroom . That s what she s going to go do . Oh my god , this fucking midget . I got to get rid of this shit . That s right . I ain t even started the pussy hero game . Ready ? Ready ? Begin . Rub the lips .

And yeah , learn the shocker , guys . Yeah , learn that shit . Your woman is freaky just like you . Trust me . She wants to ride in here in her sex life . Start off with a shocker .

Thank you so much for coming , I really appreciate it There are some Wang badges on your tables So , but I m not in the dark now , you ll probably prick yourself But later , if you re in a walk around town with a Wang in your chest , go ahead , dig in Yeah , I am Phil Wang , and yes , that is better than your name It s way better , it s got a Wang in it I m Phil Wang , but I also go by Phil So , I m feel free to use that Wang , Wang will do Wangers From my time in the west country Wang Kimuun Yuan Secretary General Wang Kimuun Chiti Chiti Wang Wang Chiti Chiti Wang Wang Bitty Fitty Wang Pang , which never made any sense , I don t know what that was I think someone just took a theme too far One of the nicknames , oh the Trubby Guy , the one over there , the one with glasses The best I ve ever had , but we ll get to that later And Philip , which is the full version of Phil I d like to just start with a song Hope this works Or just put them on a plane for silent I should probably just warn you at this point that this show has received a two star review Uh oh A three star review All right , a four star review , not bad And a five star review , will done Wang I mean it s almost as if the whole thing is subjective I guess the question now is which show are you guys in for I don t know about you , but I m feeling the three I think it s cast And yes , so this show is called Mellow Yellow Thanks , I like it too I think Mellow Yellow , it s just very deafly and accurately sums up my two most important characteristics You know , Mellow , I m a pretty laid back guy In the house party of life , I like to think I m the kitchen Just full of deep conversation and snacks I m so becoming known for him , becoming known as a relaxed laid back comic That s what all the reviews sort of last year s show , that was a very relaxed , confident show The never said was that funny But they were definitely impressed by how well I seem to think it was going So Something or something in it So that s Mellow And then yellow , Mellow of course , is my favorite cold place song Because it reminds me of Chinese people s skin And I ve been getting a lot of flack for the show title Mellow Yellow Being a lot of flack from friends who I think are trying to look out for me But I ve got the wrong idea I found myself in this strange position of having people be offended by me on my behalf You know , even comedians , comedians have been giving me shit about this The most morally compromised people in the world I ve been trying to give me shit , some kind of moral background of a mind show Oh Phil , don t call it Mellow Yellow Oh come on Phil , have some self respect and do a stupid pun on your name , the rest of us Oh come on Phil , just have some dignity and call it Wangnam style , please That s what we want Because that s the thing that people say the Chinese people have yellow skin And I ve been thinking about it , you know , is that racist ? </s> <s> I m not going to mention of it , you know , is that offensive ? Color s a color , there s nothing inherently insulting about a color Some people go too far with this stuff , some people say they don t see color What ? What s really proud of it as well ? Oh , I don t see color , Phil It s nothing to be proud of , that s just a visual impairment I don t see color , I see color , I see it all the time It s kind of the point of color I don t think it s seeing the color , there s a bad thing It depends what you do with information , you know If you re positive with it , I m negative with it Myself , I ve come to embrace the whole thing You know , I think we sporter , rather , jolly jaundice Happy Hugh I mean , it s hard to meet a bad mood when you re the color of this my life ace I just look in the mirror and have a nice day So this is , shows ostensibly about me trying to figure out what kind of comedian I want to be You know what genre I think about serve , what I want out of this career And like , is this it , you know , am I like a race comic ? You know , like a come on stage , I m like , Chinese , huh ? Maybe it s worked out so far , it s coming here But it s not all fun being sort of the race comic It has its downsides , like every time I get on stage I can feel a palpable tension in the room , you know I m kind of on stage , I m going to feel the audience thinking Oh no , not another Chinese comedian Ugh , they re everywhere Every time I turn on the TV , there s another bloody Chinese comedian babbling on about dumplings and fireworks Long walls , ugh , enough s enough on sobriety , we re the white guys I m trying to be sarcastic There are hardly any Chinese comedians , basically , there are two of us And we take turns I roll tonight , yes It s always trying to be a stranger , there are more Chinese comedians , you know At least mathematically Something doesn t add up Because I don t know if you know this , but there are Fuck loads of Chinese people , there s a lot There s a lot , like more than this Even And I would have thought that from among , you know , 1 . 4 billion people There d be a couple of jokesters A couple of class clowns Who had managed not to get assassinated by the government For making fun of the people s airline food I don t know , I would have thought the culture that came up with chopsticks As a means of eating As a pretty cosancy humor , I mean I ve seen the shit , every meal is like a masterclass and slapstick Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa , pass me a fork , whoa , whoa , Jesus I m calling in their frowns Starving over here Can t get no purchase on my pork Chinese are considered very technically capable people , but we re not considered very funny people on the global stage It s not fair , it seems like every other culture gets accredited with a good sense of humor People are always like , oh yes , the British Yes , yes , a dry , witty people Oh the Jewish , yes , the Jewish , a dry , witty people Oh the Chinese are going to take over the world , don t trust them , hide your dogs It s like , we don t eat dogs That s the Koreans , a bit look over them , they re fucking weirdos , what s their problem Leave that Put your lo and park We re making the rest of us look bad But no worry , I m only half Chinese , half Chinese , half English , so chill out My dad s Chinese , my mother s English , two people had so much chemistry , they needed language barrier Just to slow that sexy shit down , it s too much So I like to think of myself as like a gentle introduction to Asian people You know , like a beginner s course If you ve never had an Asian before , I m a good place to start Nothing too shocking , how easy you are to show you the ropes , I m different from a familiar And allow you to move on to more real stuff But I m a gateway Asian , basically , I m trying to say I m a gateway Asian , I m perfectly harmless on my own But be careful , I could get you hooked And start you down a dangerous path of pure , more harmful class A Asians So one day you wake up in a ditch covered in Kim Jong un and you re done away alive when So just take me socially , you re doing your drunk at a party I do enjoy our customs and holidays , everyone have a good Chinese near ? </s> <s> No , just a snort from one guy How do great Chinese near ? Thanks for asking how do really good Chinese near ? Nice Chinese near ? Spend it with my family ? Yeah , and I had a nice Chinese , but for those you don t know , Chinese near It s like a regular near , except with dignity There s nothing you re vomiting in the streets We re getting off of filthy strangers on Chinese near when the clock strikes 12 We all just respectfully bow , one another And then we fuck , yeah And we get straight to the good stuff We re inefficient people That s why there s so many of us But my celebrations with my family tend to be somewhat more platonic Colossal fashion That s why Chinese near with my family I mean we just call it New Year Save time , you know what I mean It s nice to see we re going out for lunch Me and my family went out for lunch went to Chinatown We went to town Went to a Chinese restaurant We went to a Sichuan restaurant , I said Sichuan is a specific Chinese cuisine And to a Sichuan restaurant But the thing is I told my sister we should go to Dim Sum place I wanted to get some Dim Sum And then my father we should go to a Cantonese place And then he told my mother we should go to a Sichuan place You know just a classic case of whispers And naturally I got quite annoyed with my father for making us go there So I grabbed his arm and gave him a burn But hey that s family for you That s my family and I wouldn t change him I m not for all the tea I didn t think I d know that did you I got 50 of these fuckers This is a whole night now , this is just this For three hours So we get to the Sichuan restaurant We sit down at our Sichuan tables and our Sichuan menus By our Sichuan waiters And I m looking through the menu as I want to do in such an establishment And next to some of these dishes are these little symbols You ve probably seen symbols in menus before Like a green leaf for a vegetarian Or like a red chili for spicy Or like a pound sign And then like one and two for 12 pounds Some symbols are a little harder to understand than others But this restaurant had come up with a few symbols of its own The real mavericks down in town And so I was looking through these symbols A couple of symbols notes of note of their own symbols The first one I noticed was specialty So that symbol was next to any dish they went Special , get the word out Dish is special And the symbol for specialty was this little Chinese word Written like a really Chinese shade of red It encircled like a really Chinese imperial Chinese circle It was just a really hammer home point And it was just to make it very clear what nationality of cuisine you re about to eat And just in case anyone sat down saw the Chinese waiters And the lanterns and the paintings of dragons And was like this is the weirdest tapas bar I ve ever been to What s going on ? </s> <s> Another symbol of note was recommended So this dish is recommended We recommend this dish We recommend you eat and then pay for this dish This dish is recommended And those denoted by a little red star Which I assume men were communist party approved I guess they re the as everywhere , friends And so I m looking through the menu to see if any of these symbols come up And sure enough some dishes are recommended Some dishes are recommended specialties But then some dishes were specialties But they weren t recommended What ? I guess I appreciate your honesty The Chinese restaurant but that s kind of weird Because that means when they re going around devising the menu They must interview the chefs And they went to one chef and they re like Oh hey Fung Hey Fung , what dish is for viewers would you say is your specialty ? And Fung when Oh , I don t know , the tofu with mint s pork I guess I made that dish very specially That s my special dish of tofu with mint s pork Okay , and would you recommend it or No What do you stupid yak ? Gross No , I mean don t get me wrong I make it very accurately But it is just inherently disgusting It s weird the better get a making of the worst it s aist I think that s how it s supposed to taste Very special though So that s my Chinese stuff Is it one okay ? I don t want to write maybe I ll build a career on it I don t know I ve also tried being like a young comic You know like a young Because come young and when you re ish And when you re young coming this and pressure to be very youthful And vibrant and to bound on to stay age and be like Oh my friend it is way And And so I went out and I got these shoes But it turns out there s more to it than that I mean I guess I m 25 but I don t really feel Yeah , I feel like I ve wasted most of my youth Being obsessed with this idea of achievement I ve always been obsessed with achievement I ve never lived in the present I ve been living in Swam in the future Have I achieved enough by this point will I achieve enough by that point And I exacerbate the problem still I keep comparing myself to other more successful young people You know like from today or even like from the past Like for example a buddy Holly I don t know if you know buddy Holly But when buddy Holly was 25 He had already released three records Single handedly revolutionized rock and roll music And had actually been dead for three years That s why I m present I haven t even died yet That s the easiest of the three things to do And all Wang Ki moon can t even be bothered to fucking kill himself It s pathetic Ridiculous I don t really do young stuff You know I m a bit of an old soul that kind of bugs me I don t do young things really Like I don t go clubbing You know I don t own anything with keep calm and something on it I don t have any photos on Facebook of me Like stroking a tiger for no reason Or like jumping off a thing into some water I ve never been on a land holiday to a ruined Mediterranean island Never done that Mainly because the main reason I have never been on a land holiday Is that due to the size of my social circle I think with me a land holiday will just look more like A romantic getaway It s like a nice weekend It wouldn t look right It wouldn t elicit the reaction you d want Because when you re on a land holiday and you re walking down the beach You want people to be shouting Hey , keep that down You don t want them to be shouting Hey , good for you Really , really brave you guys Keep up the good fight Even if I try to make a feel ladder , it wouldn t work All right , let s go into daylight Wait , let s Wait , let s go Wait , let s go into daylight Wait , let s go Wait , let s go into daylight Wait , let s go into daylight Let s go into daylight Lad Nick , what are you doing ? </s> <s> Read by the bull ? Yeah , let s read by the bull Shagaloo I ve only been traveling enough in general , I don t think You re supposed to do that when you re young , right ? Go and see the world on your suppolims Glide across the seas on your smooth skin I was like a flying fish And I ve done that , I ve never . . . Most young people do that during the Gap year , don t they ? They take the opportunity on the Gap year to go out and see the world Help out a struggling country And I didn t want to do that , I didn t want to go on a Gap year And I mean , don t get me wrong , it s not that I don t love Patronizing foreign people I m a middle class liberal , that sort of Hypocritical self satisfaction is all about I just didn t . . . I just didn t think it would have worked me in a Gap year Just the two ideas don t really go together , I just wouldn t have worked at all For example , I eat a lot Like . . . A lot So the extent that I probably would have left The developing country with even fewer resources Than they had before I got there I d be like a biblical plague to those people Like for generations that tell folk tales about me To their kids and sing songs About the beige giant who ruined everything You know , like I turned up and they re just like Oh no , my harvest ! Oh no , my babies ! Oh no , my babies ! Fanta licious , thanks guys Another reason I didn t go on a Gap year is when you go on a Gap year There s this impression and expectation for self discovery Isn t it ? It s supposed to go out there and find out who you truly are Inside the real essence of your being And then you tweet it And again , I didn t want to do that I ve always had this sort of nagging suspicion that deep down I m just prick You know , just like . . . just a real bag of crap And I could not afford to have her confirmed Especially not broad Or I don t know anyone But you insecure enough of that age , I didn t need to wake up one morning in a hut and I . . . Oh , I m an asshole ! Okay Everything makes sense now I guess I can go home and I just kick over in the hut door like Sorry kids , no football today Uncle Phil s found himself Get off me , I ll stop hugging me and say , be kidding I don t know where I m tasty , baby s there , I ve got a long flight I have held onto some useful attributes I love Batman I love Batman so much , I love Batman too A couple years ago if you d asked me what I felt my purpose in life was I probably would have been like , comedy But what if I ve come to realise It s really comedy is just my favourite means of affording Batman merchandise That s what we re all here for , ultimately I just love everything All my major life decisions have been made in it with the desire to be more like Batman For example , he s a genius inventor I studied engineering at university He works alone I don t have any friends My choice He s achieved the peak of physical fitness I did a squat last Sunday A whole squat I dropped a yum yum Although Batman is also an orphan My parents are still alive And I ve never really forgiven them for that I m just happy I ve never really forgiven them for that And just selfish holding me back I love Batman Batman s one of Batman teachers is all kinds of important and valuable life lessons To live with honor , to value family And that underwear is a fluid concept But I think the most important lesson Batman teaches us is to never kill You must never kill , Batman doesn t kill and neither should he You must never kill Even if it s your worst enemy , even if it s the most terrible villain You must not kill them , even if it s a joke , you must not kill them Because if you kill them , then they can t be reused indefinitely in future episodes And you have to start using rubbish villains like the clock king and no one wants that I was a big fan of the Nolan trilogy I thought those movies were great I thought they were epic in their scope They were fearless in their ambition And half of ways , but look really nice I ve never found a good ending to that bit But one negative effect the Nolan trilogy had I think on films was it started this trend of the gritty reboot You know the gritty reboot like taking an old story , an old film and remaking it But darker , more mature , to translate adults And I guess that made sense with Batman But it spun out a hand and came to a head with a release of the film Maleficent Maleficent was a gritty reboot of Sleeping Beauty And that s his children s story , that needs to happen Is that what films are going to be now ? </s> <s> You know just ugly reimagining of children s stories like where is this going to end ? I think here with this searing parody Because I m never one to miss out on a potentially lucrative trend As my now defunct Wang Jazzling business will attest to And so what I ve done is I ve just gone ahead And come up with a few reboot ideas of my own Based on some of my favorite TV shows as a child And I ll show them to you now Now ideally these would be backed by some Hans Zimmer Music , Hans tends to do all the reboot music But unfortunately Hans couldn t write anything for my show He was too busy throwing darts at a photo of Danny Elfman Or John Williams depending on which of those two men you re aware of But I ve done the next best thing really And I ve demonstrated it earlier I ve got this loop pedal And what I m going to do is I m just going to try and sing the music again And sort of build it up piece by piece And hopefully we ll end up something that basically sounds right Because previous criticisms , well critics have previously said of my show that it lacked layers And I ve taken that critique maybe a little too literally But we ll say how it goes So this is my first reboot Now in order to have a grid reboot you need to start with some of a low pitocato bass So something like . . . . . . . . . You know In the other verse someunn tape of Pride and the Carto string , so BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG Minininininin Hi 보면文 I don t know how to spell this . I don t know how to spell this . So this could be a plus . In a world where post must be delivered one man and one black and white cat must become a rich , narrow country roads and a privatization of a royal male to flirt with a retired women of green damn . You should know better when anyone jess buys me this for the pussy . I m a son of Mickey Raw and I m a brat . Thanks you guys . Thank you . I really appreciate that . Thank you very much . I just think Pat could be a little cooler . Be a little bit more like me . I ve probably been a cool comedian as well trying to be a comic who runs on stage and leans on stuff for an hour . I ve gone through a great lengths to try and be cool . I really have . I started smoking . Thank you . It s going really well . The smoking is getting a little out of hand . I ve started smoking hand rolled cigarettes , you know , like rollies . We have to get the fills in the paper and the tobacco and you put it together . And you know an addiction getting worse when you start self manufacturing your own vice . I don t have time to pick a color but box . Just give me the wrong greeting . So I ll do myself . Give it to me now . I think in a couple of months I ll just be going straight to the back of plantations . </s> <s> Just taking the leaves off the plasm . No time . No time . Although I have noticed that the attitude towards hand rolled cigarettes is quite different compared to the attitude towards straights . You know , ready made cigarettes from out of the back . Because hand rolled cigarettes rollies , they re a little more like a cool , right ? A little more like indie , you know ? A little more hip , a little more . . . Yeah . A little more street cred . People are active in differently . Like if you re smoking a straights cigarette from out of the pack , people are like , UGH ! That s a filthy habit . Oh , you re disgusting . Addict . You re going to give me cancer . Oh , don t look at my children . Hey , you go away . Pugh ! But then if you re smoking hand rolled cigarettes , people are more like , oh , so what are you working on at the moment ? Okay , you got a website , I can check out . Oh , no . A terrible band I can listen to . Let s be friends . Watch your blog , wait a minute . And I should quit smoking , and it s expensive and it s bad for you . But while I m smoking , I m trying to have as much fun with it as I can . So what I like to do now that I live in London is from time to time , I ll put on like a big seat , and I ll just walk into the city , and I ll just join random groups of bankers on the Fag breaks . Just try and fit in , see how long it can last . You know , just say really bank free things . Oh , banks . Oh , the NASDAQ . The nutstack , my gosh , I m crazy . That s crazy stuff . Oh , coins getting heavier . Oh , God . I try and give them bad advice . Yeah , we ve got a VHS is making a comeback . Investing a lot in VHS right now . Get in there , get in there early . Try and get involved in the office politics , even though I don t know anything about their office . You know , like one of them will say something like , oh , Glenn s really been tightening the screws recently . And I m like , fuck , Glenn . Classic piece of shit , Glenn . I ve had enough of that Glenn asshole . You know what , you much on the office telling me , it s either him or you enoughs enough . Have some self respect . I m in human resources . Okay , bye , and then I move on . I just work my way around Canary Wharf , until like a gig or dinner . </s> <s> You ve got to fill your days . I ve actually been doing that for a few weeks , and I am now a managing director at Out West . I didn t mean to , but just don t bank in Out West , because I ve lost all the papers . I don t . . . Like the papers which says , I don t know whose money is who s , I don t know . I ve dropped the papers , and they all got messed . I don t know which one . I ve just been guessing on what you re wearing . I mainly picked up smoking to impress women . You know women ? Ladies , girls , countermen ? Good people . I highly recommend it . Try them out . Because ladies love a smoker , don t they ? Mmm , ladies look at nodding ahead from side to side . Yeah , they do . Mmm , yes , Phil , they do . Ladies . . . Ladies just love a smoker . Mmm , ladies love a man who has to leave the building in every 20 minutes . Oh , he s so outgoing . Oh . LAUGHTER It makes it much easier to be single . If you smoke , you can kind of pretend that s why . I just wanted to concentrate on smoking right now . I was kind of . . . I was kind of . . . I was kind of . . . I was kind of . . . I was kind of . . . I didn t have a girlfriend until recently , but we broke up due to creative differences . But I thought I was creative , and she thought different . And it s going okay until . . . Well , hey , lad , would you like to . . . Ooh , let s . . . Let s , we ll like to . . . You ll like . . . You ll like . . . Ooh , let s . . . We ll like to . . . Hey , lad , hey , lad . . . Hey , lad , hey , hey , hey . . . Any . . . Any ladder there ? Any ladder that ever dated a bisexual woman out of a sense of curiosity only to push her over the brink of heterosexuality into full blown lesbianism forever ? Anyone ? No , no . Because I ve done that twice now . In a row , like one and then again , one more time . And I mean , if that happens once , that s just . . . That s just a funny story . But twice . . . Twice in a row . . . That s what the scientific community likes to call a pattern . There s a line of best fit to that shit . I don t know when it s going to end . But depending on how I under feel about that situation , I can look at that one of two ways , right ? Either I can think . . . My time with her was so awful . I actually caused her to lose faith in the entire male gender . Or . . . She went . . . Well , there s no topping Wang . There is no topping the Wang Massage General that is men done . </s> <s> I m going to quit while I m ahead . I m going to go with these other be penis losers to bring on the ladies . Either way , it s impressive what I ve done . So I m back on the dating scene now . It s not a good scene . The dating scene is like a movie scene . It s a bad scene . Terrible lighting , rubbish dialogue . If the dating scene is a movie scene , I m just one of the extras in a scene just sort of looking through the window at all the main characters . I m trying to get some screen time . That s the director just kicks me off set . The dating s confusing , man , it s hard to get your head around . Why is going to the cinema considered a good day ? That s a classic day . Go to cinema , see a film . Doesn t make any sense at all . It s not conducive to social environment . Oh , hey , all things were coming . Oh , no , sit down . Please . Now , shut up . And look over there . For two hours . I spent good money on this date and don t turn on wasting it , getting to know you . I m going to get to know every character s motivations . I m going to follow every plot line . And yes , we re going to stay till after the credits . It s a Marvel film you re creding . So yeah , I m quite good at dating . I m quite good . I m actually surprised . I m all right . I m quite a good flirt . You might not think it . I m actually quite a good flirt because flirting s easy , you know ? Like , oh , hey . You know , see , I m quite good . I m quite good . She had an aneurysm . She said that was so good . Oh , geez , fuck . Yeah . I m quite a flirt easy . Oh , hey , what do you . . . You know , you know . Oh , hey , what do you . . . What do you . . . Oh , do you . . . You know , flirt is easy . All flirting is this pretending you have stuff in common . I also . . . Oh , what s your name ? Oh , me too . I know . Sandra , anyone can do that . Child s play . Now , what I find most more difficult is the tale end of the process , you know ? Sealing the deal . Hey , Lance . Going in for the kill . Hey , fellas . You know ? Knowing when to lean in , invite about yours , whisper in her hair . You know ? I can never really breathe a situation very well . I never know when to take the plunge , when to commit , when to go full flurped . You know , because it can always go on a two ways , right ? It s always a bit of a gamble . I have a problem , which I think a lot of men have , which I find very difficult differentiating between sexual tension . </s> <s> And just tension . You know , just . . . Just regular unease . It feels the same to me . I don t know , which one . . . It s really dangerous . Every time I m alone with a girl and we haven t said anything for a while , I m like , we re about to get it on . Or is she still annoyed about paying for dinner ? Seems fair enough to me . I cooked the damn thing . I don t see why she can t ship in . Saddeens and Rye St . Cheap , baby . Now , it s normally the industry standard at this point for a young male comedian , especially a shlubby one , to be quite self deprecating about his sexual prowess . I m supposed to come up here and be like , oh , I had sex with a girl , two years ago , and we cried . And then you all go , ha ha , sounds about right , yeah . But I m afraid I don t get to do those jokes , because I m unfortunately excellent at sex . I m really . . . I know , I m really good . It s not comfortable , I know , but it s the truth . I wish it weren t , it d be funny if it weren t , but it s a way . . . I didn t see . . . Hey , it was a surprise to me , too . I did not see that one coming . It s a real turn off of the books . But every time I ve sex with a girl , she s like , oh , wow , really ? And I m like , yeah , all right . What a waste . Never before has so much been enjoyed by so few . And as Churchill said . . . I think what it is is I m not real combination of gentle but exciting . But what do you mean during four player cases , you just pop my head up and go , boo ! I m just . . . Keep the honey s on their toes . I talk a lot during sex as well , I talk a lot . I talk a lot during sex . I m a real chatty catty . You can t shut me up . I talk a lot during sex , I think it s important . Keep up on the lines , do you talk a lot during sex ? No , just of gut rolled nerds . I ll tell you when it s over . Like a meditation . So try it out , man . Take up a couple evening classes , learn a few phrases . Or the be careful . . . I think it s important to keep up on the lines communication . Check in every couple of minutes , make sure everything s above board . See how each one s doing . I like to commentate . Talk about shit , analyze stuff for trying . </s> <s> Or the be careful about the words you use . I think the vocabulary one adopts during sex can be very revealing . You can see a lot about who you are as a person . For example , during the course of my sexual career , I have used the words resourceful . Context . Logistically . And depleted . And the all made sense of the time . This kind of lever I am , very much a boss . Technical . Because I think it s important to be good at sex . Sex is kind of art . I think sex is sort of our first thought , and every art is stem from it . I like to think I m artistic . I think my artistic side was probably started by one of my favorite TV shows as a child . It was a good show . I think this two could do with modern remake . Now this I think would be like a creepy reboot . Sometimes movies are made again , but creepier . And I also have a creepy reboot . All you need is a little girl singing a nursery rhyme for no reason . And it can be any nursery rhyme at all . So miss , what s your favorite ? Just pick a nursery rhyme . Twinkle , twinkle , little star . Classic . So be something like . Twinkle . Shit . Is that it ? Okay . Okay , try that . Hello . How about one tip ? Sure . Yeah . What about . . . Oh , is it just like , oh , here we go . That s good . Yeah , that would be okay . Who ? Wouldn t it be weird if I kept that bit in ? Like , why would I keep that bit in ? Like , you watch it . You watch it on YouTube and it s all really sharp . And then that bit , why did you keep that in ? And so . . . What s wrong with this guy ? Did he just do like 20 minutes properly ? And then just . . . Okay , here we go . Okay . Twinkle , twinkle , little star . Twinkle , twinkle , little star . Memories ? Memories ? And over that like . . . Over that sort of creepy cello . Twinkle , twinkle , little star . And then maybe like a lightning . Twinkle , twinkle , little star . So we re open on two policemen looking over a bunch of dead bodies . All arranged in the shape of a big cat . It s a massacre . You call it a massacre . He calls it an architect . We cut to a SWAT team bursting into an abandoned warehouse . And it s pitch black , except for a single cone of light in the middle of the rain . And then a northern voice from the darkness goes , Good evening , gentlemen . Years when I made earlier . And the severed head rolls into the light , Covered in little gold stars and needs . Want to know how to do it yourselves . </s> <s> All you need in a Neil Buchanan s head enters a light . It s a little pv a glue . Ah , ha , ha , ha . Wait , even by then , I can t see in the shops . Jason Steyford , Willem DeFoe , And Neil Buchanan as himself in Buchanan Rises . This summer , not even a grown up , can help you . Thank you guys , and thank you for sticking with me through that difficult time . Neil Buchanan was a real role model for me growing up . I think for me he encapsulated the perfect balance of masculinity and femininity . He had a downpack . He had an element of each , and he had a nice balance . Like he was a patron of the arts , but also a war of the occasional denim jacket . I think men of my generation can do a lot more positive role models . We don t really have any . We don t only know what masculinity means anymore . What manliness means has become very vague in definition . Back in the day , it was very clear . We 40 years ago before the traditional masculine industries were decimated . Back in the day , if you were a man , you d go to work and you d hit a thing . You know , and you d pull a thing , and you d push a thing , and you d go , and you d kick a thing , and you d pay for it . And you d go up and have lunch on a big girder in the sky . And so I want to take a photo of you . And then you d come back down and you d melt a thing , and you d kill a thing , and you d go , and then at the end of the day , another man would look at his watch and pull on a big whistle . And you d go home , and you d ignore your wife , shout your kids , and go to sleep . And you re a man . You knew you were . But now , my generation of men , we just stand around on street corners , trying not to break anything , apologizing for our fathers . We don t really know what I mean . I think my generation of men is simultaneously the most depraved and the most enlightened generation of men in history . We have a generation of Kindle and Tinder . We re very confused . We don t know what society wants from us . I don t think we feel like we own a manliness anymore . I think , basically , somewhere along the line , masculinity sort of got bought wholesale by corporations , and then homogenized , diced up into tiny pieces . And masculinity is now being sold back to men , mainly in the form of fast food that s too big . Have you seen this like a rat ? Try the new McDonald s dick tower . It s four patties , five rashes of bacon and a full goose . </s> <s> But you ll eat it if you got a dick . Why , you don t got a dick ? The KFC Man fuck bucket . The Man fuck it . He ll give you a heart attack . Eat it , your pussy s . Even sweets aren t safe . Snickers get some nuts . I just wanted a lovely chocolate treat . Don t bring my balls into this . They ve done nothing to you , sir . I think my favourite manhood , though , has to be McCoy s . McCoy s man crisps ? McCoy s man crisps . McCoy s man crisps . Women can t have them . They ll cut themselves on the ridges . They re pathetic feminine jaws and strong enough for the extra half millimeter potato that we he , Vaughan here at McCoy s man crisps . Shagaloof . Whereas the opposite seems to be true of food sold to women . You know , in food advertising to women , food is depicted as this sort of guilty secret that no one s really supposed to talk about . It s weird . Men are told too much , but women are told to eat too little . The food advertising to women is essentially just a series of downtrodden , exhausted looking female friends trying to convince one another that the product in question is sufficiently unourishing . Sandra , try this . Don t worry . This food is only 25 food . You won t feel satisfied at all . Look , an athlete is sandy . Sande ! Just once I d like to see an ad ro woman just tucking into big curry from an Indian takeaway , you know , like a big pizza from an Italian takeaway or like a chicken chow mein from a takeaway . You know , just a little , just get some balance . So I guess , I ve been trying to figure out what kind of commuter I want to be , what I want out of this career . And I think I ve realized it recently , because I recently read an interview of John Cleese , comedian and legend John Cleese in the Observer magazine . And it s after reading this interview in the Observer magazine that I realized all I want out of my career is to eventually also be interviewed in the Observer magazine . Because it s so nice , it s so nice to him , it s so nice about everyone in the interview . They re also effusive and praising . And I guess I just want to reach that point in my career , where I can be sort of portrayed in that sort of psicopantic , excessively aggrandizing language that only a left leaning culture supplement can really achieve . But unfortunately , the moment no one s willing to do that at the Observer magazine , they just hang up . So what I ve done is I ve just gone ahead and written an interview of myself in the style of the Observer magazine . And then just stuck it into a copy that my mum left it on . It s basically the same thing . I ll reach it now , see what you think . I think I ve come across quite well . But anyway , as you said a couple years time , it reflects what I hope to be in the near future . Anyway , okay , see what you think . </s> <s> Here we go . This is the Observer magazine s interview with Phil Wang . When Phil Wang enters the cafe in Ero , everyone takes notice . He s wearing jeans and a shirt after all . Trailing behind him alongside Miriad Awards , television series , and renamed Airports , is his suitcase , Samsung Night , of course . This Samsung Night suitcase is a good suitcase . Wang quips . As long as you don t cut its hair . Yes , I m sent . I m sent far away from the entrance , so Phil has actually been shouting this across a cafe at me . I joined Phil over counter . He doesn t have to order . They know him here . By the time he gets to the round faux granite coffee collection zone , his skinny saffron marquette is ready . Waiting . Thank you , Wang quips . To the trainee barista , who begins to bow , but then continues towards the ground , feinting from excitement , and crumbling into a tranquil , smiling heap on the floor . Looks like he could use a cup of coffee . Wang quips . The cafe erupts in laughter . Everyone with an ear shot laughs ecstatically for a duration of two month and sunsons . It strikes me at this point surveying the landscape of caffing caffeine enthusiasts that Wang s humour truly transcends age , class , creed , and in a couple of instances , species . As a jack Russell terrier and barn owl roll around in the con . Slapping their furry haunches with glee . Phil doesn t pay for the drink , but still gets three stamps on his loyalty card anyway . Loyalty is important to me . He muses . And everyone nods thoughtfully . As he quickly places a card in his wallet , makes a similar runs from Costa and Starbucks . When we sit down on the table , Phil writes a perfectly hand rolled cigarette and begins to smoke deeply and fitterly . But we re inside , I whisper . Phil laughs condescendingly , but in a way that makes me like him even more somehow . They ll make an exception . A couple of war veterans at another table see this and begin to light sigrate themselves , but are promptly injected from the premises . I never stood out to be an inspiration , Phil begins . It just sort of happened . He s referring , of course , to his Nobel comedy prizes . I ask him where they are . Wang quips . I can t remember . Trough visa silly things , really . Of course , what really matters here is the prize money , which I ve safely invested in VHS . Philip is a Greek name , of course , Wang tells me . It means lover of lips . This is trippin appears to ring true . As he panics , reaches over the table and kisses me passionately on the mouth . A logistically resourceful kiss , which in the context of the situation , let me deplete it . Thank you . Phil has in fact adopted a great deal of ancient Greek approach to life . He has , in his own words , the soaring ambition of Icarus , the unfaltering determination of Sisyphus , the sexual open mindedness of Idapace , and some Hulumi . </s> <s> I press him on his sexual eccentricity . I d heard of a new method of self pleasure he developed , involving the beating of his genitals with long canes . I ask him for the implement s technical name . Wang quips . Wang quips . Stop and think about what you just applauded for . That s a lot of answers to me . I reckon that s the new four candles , quink webs . That s just me . I ask him what s next . Where does he go from here ? I m actually working on a gritty reboot of the teletubbies . If there s a story there that hasn t been told yet , you know , a darker , more unnecessary story . As I leave the cafe , I feel blinded . Either by Wang s incandescent wisdom , or by some sunlight reflected off his brand new Bamobile . I wanted to myself , who is Phil Wang really ? A comedian , artist , international parkour champion ? He is , of course , all these things . Once I realise this , the harsh , possibly damaging glare at my right eye , suddenly begins to feel rather warm . This week also met ex president of the United States and new UN Secretary General Barack Obama . He was fine . Thank you . Thanks . Thank you . You ve been really nice . Thank you for coming out . Come . Come . Come . Come . Come . In a world . With a baby s head for a son . And no infrastructure . Except for one grand design like housemound . Four quarter looking and drudging us alien things . Must overcome the hell of an isolated life . Tiki Weekney hasn t got out of bed in a week . He can t stop watching fetish porn on his belly thing . And then like a close up of Tiki Weekney is all that . Hey , come on , man . Leave TWA alone . Shut up , Lala . You junky piece of shit . Maybe you ll stop feeling your veins with Tubby fucking custard . You d be able to help someone around here . Speaking of which , you got any custard , man . Come on , Dipsy . I ll suck your end , Anna . Tubby bye bye , Lala . Tubby bye bye forever . Tell it , Tubby . Save his kind . In the face of Tubby custard . Go , Tubby toast . And Tubby treachery .

Come on , four beers , like , like , Heights , not Snakes , not Spiders , not . . . I can t find spaces , not . . . Would you have it ? I was like , Dad , you must be . You must be scared of something . There must be something . And he was quiet for a couple of minutes . Right ? 30 seconds , I saw maybe . Quiet on the phone . And he was thinking , and he hit his back . He hit his back with the answer , the answer , the Dad answer , the only thing I should ever be scared of .

How was the gig ? It s good until the end , then he just stood on stage , it was vile , it was disgusting . It was actually disgusting . I ve never seen 6 , 000 people kick someone to death , but it was worth it . LAUGHTER This is what happened , right ? It s true story . Last year , February last year , the St . Pankas Hotel in London , big hotel on the Euro Star Line , Euro Star comes in , it s the gateway in London from Europe by train , right ? Sunday afternoon , in February last year , a man walked into the St . Pankas Hotel at midday with a knife . He walked in with a knife , he was threatening the staff , he was threatening the punters , he was racially abusive to the staff . The police were called quite right . The police came , he fled the scene , they didn t catch him . 12 hours later , this guy checked in . LAUGHTER I m not very perceptive at the best of times , I didn t catch the vibe . I thought these staff were really , really helpful and respectful , and genuinely happy to have me in their hotel . I walked in , I m checking in , I m checking in , and they re going . . .

Oh my god , you are the police , I m so sorry , I m so sorry . I took the latch off , the moment the latch came off . Wump ! Door flies in , one of them runs in and like , clear the room .

They literally stopped , loosened their grips , turned around and calmly and quietly . It s marched me back to my room like a sweet walking child . Sat me down on the bed , sat down , took the cuffs off . One of them kneels down , he goes , listen sir , it s been a terrible mistake . We realise now you are not the man we re looking for , mainly when you start crying . I m sitting there going , before you re heartened , decked . Are you hearted ? Are you on me another way around ? Are you showing us all out ? Even so strong and nipped , nipped . It d be Armstrong bed that way . He pulled me hair .

We were called , we came to the scene , he escaped , we did not catch that man . You ve just checked in now and the staff of I did , he was that man , that s what s happened .

The fatigue comes back with a tissue smirk and I m like , I m just going to be on the back to you . You re not going to be on the back to you . You re not going to prison . And I get it , I get it . They apologized and that s brilliant , that s lovely . But if this guy standing in front of you on stage , Chris , could be the ruler of most of my life . Out of said , that s absolutely fine sir , thank you very much . London , I understand it s high security . You re doing a hard job very well , thank you sir . Now what I said , March , all of the staff members who I did me in this room now . Now what I ve asked them , the question , that s been bugging me more than the fucking cauliflower . More than the guy from the Undeadables . I said , listen guys , you tell me right now which , which knife wield and racist . Does the knife wield and racism ? Flies the scene . Then 12 hours later , checks back into the same fucking hotel . What , to sleep off all the racism ? In what world does it , so they imagine that he ran in and went , right you bunch of fuck , it s nice in here . Remember Corley , call him in a home alone , two of his gorgeous . Right you before I never let me tell you to fuck off batting your own company or something disgusting . Is the breakfast buffet , a alacart ? Alacart , fantastic , brilliant , oh I ll get ex venny to you . Wi fi , two videos at once , brilliant , like . And this yours called is Atchress Ramsay . And I discovered exactly who Chris Ramsay was that day . Yeah , I ll tell you I think I am , eh ? I m the guy , I m the guy who sits at home watching something on Netflix . Ramsay s already ruined . Watched it anyway , and you remember when it was coming , it was rubbish . And the guy who sits at home , someone s arrested on TV for something they didn t do . And I ll give it the big and don t know . I ll sit there in the house with a can going , what I should do with that . It s fucking unrealistic , it s stupid . It s fucking what you re just letting them arrest her . She meant all what I should do with that . That was me , Rosie , eh ? That was me , give it the fucking big and wouldn t I ? </s> <s> I ll be like , you ll never take us alive , pigs ! Eh ?

One sort of fall , who this idiot standing before you is , eh ? I did three things . Three things that proved to them exactly who I was , that I wasn t the man that we re looking for . Number one , instant tears . Fucking instantaneous . I didn t realise I was crying until I could taste it in my mouth . Oh , oh , I m having a breakdown ! I m surprised the wounds firing out of me head . Right ? Second thing , right ? They get me , as you saw when I acted it out , they have got us and they re pushing us down the corridor , eh ? And they re going , you re coming with us , you re coming with us , you re coming with us . I m not resisting arrest , but I am , in a way , because as they re going , you re coming with us . I m replying with , but I m in my underpants . But I can t go out in my underpants . That s how when arrest works , you fucking pellic . The third thing , the thing I did that proves once and for all , exactly what kind of guy stands in front of you right now , was the moment that the police armed police had learned in kick my hotel door in . Put handcuffs on me in my underpants . Grab me by my hair , pulled me off the door , march me down that corridor . Three armed police , six hotel staff . You know how many people watching the commotion through the peoples and their door ? I screamed in my underpants through tears of fear . It was normal porn ! Let s normal porn ! You cast a list of being a dream , I didn t know I d fulfill . Thank you so much . Thank you so much indeed . I love you all , good night ! Thank you ! </s>"

This is what I think I think women and Indian men have the exact opposite when it comes to social issues Because women get too much sexual attention Indian men don t get enough You see a woman walk into a nightclub everyone staring at her Learing at her oh yeah look at that Give me some of that look at that ass here Where s what do you think when an Indian man walks into a nightclub ? </s> <s> Nothing He s lucky enough to even be let into the nightclub as it is He talks to any girl he immediately becomes the creepy brown man Every girl has some story of the creepy brown guy All these creepy brown guys trying to add me on Facebook Just want to go to the club have fun with my girls all these creepy brown men keep hitting on me Even my mom who is married to a brown man tells my 18 year old sister how you be careful of these fucking brown men , okay ? And I get it we can be creepy we can be really creepy , but girls you can be creepy too Drunk white girls that is some of the creepiest shit I ve ever seen I was at a club this girl she just yelled out what girl wasted and She just flashed everyone and Everyone just cheered her on They re like yeah titties The club put her on their VIP list Now let s reverse the roles there , okay ? If I was at a club just decide to take down my pants We re about my dick Just be like yeah , brown man . We re still The only list I d be going on is the sex offenders registry See women you can walk into a room and immediately everyone wants to sleep with you now I know that s not always a good thing , but fuck don t take that for granted . I ll never know what that s like The only place I can walk into and have everyone want to fuck me is prison . That s it Because this is the problem when you re a brown man You re at the bottom when it comes to sex appeal Every other race seems to have something good going for them . Don t they ? Black guys they got big dicks Europeans latins they re sensual they re romantic White guys You just white that s all you need Whereas there s no girl out there that s like oh , I just love Indian man No girl sexual fantasy takes place in a 7 Eleven Yeah No girls calling Telstra to have phone sex No girl is like oh every time I get into a taxi I just get so wet Yeah 50 shades of gray only worked as an erotic novel because it was a white guy If it was a brown guy it would have been a police report That s the real white male privilege right there . It s not that you have better job prospects . You ve got better blowjob prospects And Ugly white guy can travel anywhere in the world still get his dick sucked Whereas the only action a brown guy gets when he travels is when airport security finger bangs his asshole . That s about it And and white girls as well at Becky can finish her degree backpack around Europe Sleep with a bunch of guys and she s a free spirit Whereas if venez Finishes his IT course Rocks up to the European border like hey , I ve come to fuck your women . Oh He won t even be a free man I Will admit this much if if you have an Indian accent It s not the most romantic accent It s hard to seduce women with an Indian accent isn t it Can t compete with these exotic accents just sweep women off their feet immediately You know these ones Hello My name is Fernando You You are the most beautiful girl I ve ever seen I want to make love to you on a moonlit beach Yeah , compare that to oh hello , baby You know you are so beautiful So unmi luo bili bili bili Absolutely Hey Vijay Vijay Kamlo Kamlo Kamlo Kamlo I want to have intercourse with you No girls ever having an Indian romance Girls will come back from a country like Spain be like oh Spain That was where I met Javier He picked me up in his motorbike Then we rode across the countryside and made love till the morning There is no girls coming back from India like oh India That was where I met Sharkdeep He picked me up in his Rikshaw Then he gave me a cow and said I was his wife And you know what the problem is the problem is the media because again it s the opposite to women all right women Sexualized too much in the media brown man not sexualized enough We will gladly take some of that sexualization for ourselves There are no brown sex symbols there are none there s one there s Zane Malik former one direction member But that s it That s it for brown sex symbols It s Zane Malik then it is literally me that s it We need some sex symbols all right when s the deaf Patel sex tape coming out ? </s> <s> That s what I want to know Slum doggy style millionaire When s it gonna be an Indian bachelor oh Shit Imagine that it would just be his mom Just standing there with a clipboard like a ward is your degree Arts oh no no no no One of us doesn t need to fund a new tech company one of us needs to fuck a Kardashian I ll do it I ll eat that Kardashian pussy eat it with some non bread all right Yeah , very good And Social media social media is the same is women you get all these sexual comments directed at you on social media a girl posts anything on social media The top comments always like oh Want to come on your face something like that And you know what you should give it back just as hard Forget the blogs next time your handsome friend Greg posts a photo of his salad to Facebook Don t be like oh what a yummy salad Greg Just be like hey Greg I want to sit on your face Yeah , after the salad what on you eat my ass your skinny bitch I m gonna create a whole new hashtag it s called hashtag objectify Neil and And from now on everything I I post on social media . I just want to be completely objectified One day this joke is gonna be on the internet .

Oh That ll be a great day The day an Indian man can complain like look I just want to go to the club and have fun with my dudes , but Already is creepy hot white women keep hitting on me Then we have reached the promised land So Laura was that has a how s your day been Laura s Good yeah , do you have Instagram ? Have you seen you much of a quota on Instagram ? Do you like these really profound quotes ? No That s fine . I ll be sorry , but okay Do you have you seen this quote it s If you can t handle me at my worst You know this one yeah , you don t deserve me at my best You know this one it s by Marilyn Monroe . </s> <s> Yeah , that philosopher Yeah See I didn t get that quote because it really depends How good is your best and how bad is your worst ? I still have to get some return on this investment know what I mean Don t get me wrong if your worst is just being in a bad mood once in a while of course any decent boyfriend We ll put up with that But if your worst is just being a bitch all the time Well , then your best better be a threesome with your best friend . That s the only way that s gonna work So I m single I ve been I ve been single for a couple of months I my last girlfriend and I we broke up around February I was a very jealous boyfriend You know when you re so whipped you just get irrationally jealous for no reason You text your girlfriend . I love you with a love heart She texts back . I love you without a love heart . You re like fuck . She s cheating on me done You go in her Snapchat story there s some guy in the background . You re like a team . She s fucking that guy And my ex girlfriend she was bisexual I tell that to a lot of guys they get really excited Oh Three sums every night well done No , it was a bit different . It was quite interesting actually like this one time We were lying in bed and she s scrolling through her Facebook newsfeed and this picture of this really beautiful girl comes up So I m just kind of like who ? Who s that and she s like oh ? That s my ex Oh How am I supposed to respond to that ? Can t be like oh fucking well done . No , I can t do that Do you know how emasculating that is knowing your girlfriend is fingered hotter girls than you have Jesus Christ Speaking of fingering let s talk about it Now Now we ve all done it all had it done to us Or in my case both It s definitely the least romantic sexual act you can perform like there s nothing romantic about fingering is there You can t take a girl out on a lovely picnic Share a glass of wine as the sun says Then just give her a fucking finger bang no , okay ? There s never like a vivid fingering passage in a romantic novel It s always really vague It s always like oh I felt his touch His passion was felt I Feel like if there was a descriptive fingering passage in a romantic novel . This is how it would go You General Davidson So definitely handsome bore deeply into my soul with the eyes of a man emboldened with untamed masculine courage a Courage so rampant it was to unsheath me of civilisations Defenses to strip me of all reluctance to demean me to that of but a girl his play thing Eagly submissive desperately awaiting his formidable touch . </s> <s> Oh How he fingered me I m a bit too good at that But it s true you just can t make it sound romantic everything else you can you can kiss a girl We kiss passionately in the moonlight You can look deep into her eyes so captivating was they looking at us You can make love to her our bodies dance the flamenco of love Or you can just finger back some fucking moosh that s it Every time I finger girl I just feel like a ratty 15 year old kid Just like oh yeah , just finger out song camel town station You Anyway back to my girlfriend Now this one time she was going down on me and I finished Because you know I was thinking about her ex And Then I went to the fridge I got a sandwich out of the fridge But it fell on the floor , but I just picked it up and kept eating it and She s like oh that is so disgusting and I m like you just put my dick in your mouth , okay ? And she s like yeah , but that was for you and I m like yeah , this is for me too , okay ? This is what I think I think men and women we have very different relationships without reproductive systems Because the male reproductive system is like this submissive factory worker That s just constantly churning out sperm till the day we die He s always there for us . He s like you want sperm , bro ? We ve got it for you man What s that three times in two hours ? Okay ? We ll do our best . We ll do our best Sparm sperm Whereas ladies your reproductive system is a little bit like a spoiled brat That just throws a tantrum every month And don t get me wrong she works very hard she prepares everything for you quite meticulously Then she just kind of taps you on the shoulder and he s like so it s um does that time of month ? Everything s ready as usual All I need is a little bit of sperm Where is it ? And you re like I I don t have any Why not ? Because I m like 22 and I m single and I don t really want a baby right now Oh , oh , you don t want a baby . You don t want a baby . What about me ? What about what I want look we ve been through this conversation every month since I was 12 ? I m not ready for a child . Oh well then fuck you and she just tears everything down And just like get rid of this egg yourself then bitch That s That s my intimate knowledge of the female anatomy right there The guys are like what the fuck was that ? Something pretty interesting happened to me recently . I got dead to do something pretty crazy as a club And this guy he s dancing quite close to me quite provocatively and I m with a friend my friend starts nudging me He s like oh Neil Neil that guy wants you You should kiss him That ll be funny kiss him and then he actually said this to me word for word . </s> <s> He s like hey Neil Don t be a faggot just kiss him man I Men are far less likely to sexually experiment compared to women . I read this statistic It said 20 of women have had a lesbian experience compared to 4 of men I mean 4 of men haven t had a lesbian experience , but you know what I mean Girls you so much more open with that stuff aren t you can just be like oh , you know I was just a bit drunk with my friend one time and That Katy Perry song came on We just went for it . Yeah , it was hot woo Where s that can t be like oh Yeah , I was just watching the football with my mate one day Look deep into his eyes and then we jacked each other off No So anyway , I m there and my friend is like just do it just kiss him Neil it ll be so funny And I didn t want to but then he s like hey Neil if you kiss him I ll buy you six drinks Oh I guess I d be unastrallia not to So I did it and then afterwards the guys like do you want to come home with me ? I was like , oh , I m sorry that s probably a bit too far and then he s like are you even gay ? And I felt really bad at that point because I was a straight guy leading him on So I didn t really know what to say . I was just kind of like I m not sure Which is the worst thing you can say Because then he gave me this speech like oh look I ve been in your position Just be true to yourself just believe in who you are I was like wow I just kissed a man He didn t have to make it all fucking gay geez I m kidding I fucked him Who here any weed smokers here ? I got the dealer right there that s sick I was getting high with three of my white friends the other day in this beach house And we did the most typical stoner thing you can do We start listening to two park But getting really into him You know Like we could relate And I don t know if you know this particular song , but it s called life goes on and the lyrics are literally like How many brothers fair victim to the street resting peace young niggas there s a heaven for a G And we were like yes Yes This is so true Yeah , three white guys in an Indian In a beach house How many brothers fell victim to the street none ? We lost Tim but that s because he went on exchange to France that s about it It s pretty interesting when you get high isn t it you either become one of two extremes You either become a philosopher or a toddler That s it there s no in between you re either like oh my god guys . What s the meaning of life ? Or you re like oh my god guys peanut butter on corn chips And I ve actually got a pretty low tolerance when it comes to weed So just the other day I got really high and you know when you get really high And you re not sure if your friends are as high as you so you start getting all paranoid You know you start questioning every day things that you do your friend says hi you say hi back then you re like oh Fuck you said hi weird they can tell you hi they can tell you hi And then one of your friends says something you think it s hilarious , but no one else is laughing So in your mind you re like okay , fuck Neil don t laugh don t laugh don t laugh don t laugh don t wait a minute If it looks like I m trying not to laugh that ll make me look even more high Okay , okay just laugh a little bit laugh a little bit laugh a little bit laugh a little bit laugh a little bit love it Wait a minute What if they re all just as high as I am and they re having the exact same thoughts as me ? </s> <s> Oh my god Neil it s up to you to make them feel comfortable you have to laugh you have to laugh you have to laugh You have to laugh and then by the time you laugh it s been like a minute since they spoke Everyone looks at you like an idiot you ve ruined the funeral I Well , I ll tell you guys a little bit more about myself . I was actually very conservative as a teenager Hmm , I Mean not politically That would be a bit weird Go back to where you came from Mom and dad no No conservative in the sense I was a good boy in high school didn t touch alcohol didn t touch drugs I was pretty much a loser in high school Like you know you re a loser in high school when even your wet dreams are just you jacking off I m pretty sure I had a porn addiction in high school That s not a very good addiction to have no one gives you any sympathy do they Some people say they have a sex addiction like really sex addiction That s not an addiction That s a luxury A sex addict is just a porn addict with confidence How can you be addicted to an essential biological act ? That s like being addicted to breathing And you know what they do with these sex addicts they put them in a room Where they haven t meeting with other sex addicts ? Yeah , that s safe Let s just have a necrophiliax meeting at the morgue while we re at it And I feel like you can romanticize certain addictions can t you like like drinking can be romanticized Some tall brooding man . He s like oh I drink to take the pain away Everyone s like oh he s so passionate As you can t romanticize a porn addiction can you ? I Just watched three way anal scenes to take the pain away . Oh You re just a creep I had the worst email address as a kid I mean I m pretty sure everyone s ashamed of their first email address But mine takes the cake The first email address I ever made for myself when I was 12 years old was literally I Did your mom last night at hotmail . com ?

Oh , that s cute You can be online or offline . That s it No , with MSN no You could be busy You could be away You could be out to lunch In case away wasn t specific enough for you And there was no musical privacy on MSN was there Everyone could see exactly what you were listening to Everyone had that one friends with questionable music taste That one guy that would just have girlfriend by Avril Lavigne on repeat You re like what the fuck man and they d always say the same thing they d be oh shut up . It s my sister s computer Like bullshit , you don t even have a sister , okay ? </s> <s> And how good were relationships back then those 13 year old relationships Never had to talk to a girl in person Just had to log on to MSN Be like hey Hey Sup Nm you Nm Want to go out ? Okay , lol And then you were in love If only relationships today were that easy your girlfriend comes home from work You re like hey hey Sup Nm you Nm Want to have sex okay lol You say something you regret you can just be like whoops wrong con boat You You don t want to talk to someone just give them the old BRB I got BRB so many times back in the day That s why if I m on a real date today and the girls like oh just go into the bathroom be right back .

What s up ? Wasn t Australian rapper gonna brag about oh Might Started from the lower middle class Now I m at the upper middle class You Used to have a home loan Now I ve still got a home loan But it s on an investment property And I hate these wannabe Aussie rappers that use blacks slang Like it just sounds weird with the Australian accent like I have this friend . He s a wannabe Aussie rapper He was telling me about this girl that he likes I m sure if he was an actual black guy . He would have said something like a Yo , new You know Shaolin Yeah I m feeling her dog Whereas when my friend said it it was kind of like I I kneel You know Shaolin I m feeling her dog I Got a lot of friends who are into indie music and they really hate commercial music You know they re like oh commercial music . </s> <s> It s all the same . It s all the same which fair enough it is But don t you think indie music is kind of the same as well ? Is that just me ? All right ? Don t you think every indie song it always has to start off with some introspective guitar riff Just so all the hipsters know to get their knitted sweaters and organic bread ready This is gonna be a party Then it s always some abstract lyrics sung in a very childlike voice It s always like and we ll fly our magic carpet And Go drinking with the sun Tell our hearts can smell the breath of golden waves I was like what the fuck are you talking about ? Everyone s like oh he s speaking from the soul now he s speaking from all the acid . He s taken us What else man ? What else I played I played tennis as a kid . That was my main sport All right , I played it this big complex where they bring in all these coaches from overseas and it was quite interesting Seeing the different strategies from each of the coaches for example . There was this American coach His strategy was kind of like okay On the American court I m gonna feed these balls to you based on your aptitude that you show for the game of tennis So the better you get the more balls you ll receive Hell you can hit a million balls if you want cuz this is the American court . Yeah And then there was a Russian coach and his strategy was very different It was kind of like okay on a tennis court Everyone is equality . I do not care how good you are Everyone hits same amount of balls Except my son he hit a lot more And what happened was everyone on the American court was incentivized to train harder The overall skill level improved dramatically or as things on the Russian court stayed pretty stagnant This one guy tried to speak up But the coach was like no no no if you talk beer against me you will not be hitting balls balls will be hitting you Then however this one guy on the American court ended up controlling like 99 of the balls So the American coach had to borrow all these balls from the Chinese court And no one really knew what was going on on the Chinese court But they were producing some suspiciously good tennis players They also manufactured all the rackets all the rackets were made in China They threatened to boycott America one day they re like hey America you no longer pay us back the ball We no longer make racket all racket made in China motherfucker America was like fine . I ll go to someone else . Hey , um India . What s up , dude ? India can you uh can you make me some tennis rackets ? Ah , we really make you want these cricket rackets .

I loved Pocahontas But I think you can tell the girls who are way too influenced by Pocahontas These girls who go out to these music festivals in the forest Put jewels all over their face all right We re the Native American headdress Find their hands and adventure a John Smith Who s actually just John the Plumber And They drop ten acid tabs and they re like let s paint with all the colors of the wind Sleeping beauty . </s> <s> Oh That was a good film , but I don t think they d be able to get away with that today . Would they ? I mean look at this sleeping beauty is literally date rape of the fairy tale holy shit This guy man this guy he trespasses into a private castle finds a passed out girl And his first response is oh just make out with her okay And her as well she wakes up and she s like oh a handsome white man . What a fairy tale But when Bill Cosby does it no What else did you have Aladdin Aladdin was the worst gave every guy this false hope You can be a slave boy and still get the princess Just tell her how you feel Tell her you love her she ll just magically fall in love with you So every guy fell for this the first girl you ever had a crush on you re like oh I ll just tell her how I feel she ll fall in love with me And so you tell her but no she doesn t fall in love with you does she She s like stop messaging me you fucking creep BRB And that s it your safe space is ruined You got to go and buy a fedora Open a 4chan account And that s the problem with a safe space it s a fairy tale and the thicker you build those walls The more it s gonna hurt when reality inevitably hits you That s why I think we should stop lying to kids okay stop with the happy endings stop with the fairy tales Just sit little six year old Johnny down and be like look Johnny It s 99 likely you re gonna have a shit life okay Stop giving kids certificates for everything like oh you didn t shit your pants have a certificate no okay stop this I m gonna be a whole new level of crazy parents Forget anti vax parents . I m gonna be the anti Disney parents No , I don t let my kids watch Disney films Hmm It s just horror movies and hardcore porn That way they ll have a reverse safe space Their expectation of life will be so low that they ll inevitably be surprised They ll be like oh wow this is this is actually pretty good . Oh damn Not everyone s trying to kill me and the male man s not trying to fuck me all the time . It s amazing And What else what else is big in the media everyone s talking about gender I would meet men we can be pretty bad . I would admit that you know we think without dicks But we can t help it Okay , I ll be talking to a girl my brain is like oh She s kind . She s intelligent . She s caring and my dick has to pop up and be like hmm God damn look at him titties . Oh shit . I don t know why my dick is black Well actually Oh Girls you re a lot more in control . You don t really think with your vaginas When you sober , okay That s a bit different when you re drunk isn t that is a big transition Sober girl to drunk girl holy shit The beginning of the night you so refined just oh just just want to have a civilized night out with my girlfriends Cut to a few hours later I need cock where everything And and guys we we can be pretty insecure . </s> <s> I know the stereotype is that women are insecure But men we can be insecure as well . That s right . We just hide it behind this facade of hyper masculinity Like when two guys brag about a one night stand when whenever a guy brags about a one night stand He always us to care he always us to talk about how little he cared about the girl Right , you know , you never hear two guys the morning after being like oh Dude met this gorgeous girl at the club last night . We we had a deep spiritual connection then shared an intimate night of passionate love Making off well done Why for those tears You know what it s like So it s a whole maze Met this fucking slot at the club last night . I didn t even know a name I was like fuck you re coming home with me right just fucking her man . Oh , yeah , she hit her head on the bed Didn t even drive it a hospital . Oh Oh , you re so sick Yeah , if we told the truth it would be more like oh mate You know how I feel that deep void inside me with casual sex yeah Met this gorgeous girl last night , but I haven t learned to love myself . So can t love another Oh fuck you re really sick , okay So man , I think I think we re really we are really consumed by sex like that s what Sigmund Freud said he s like the godfather of psychology is like Everything we do as human beings is somehow indirectly to obtain sex I mean he also said every boy secretly wants to sleep with his mother He s on point there fuck my mom is parts Hey It s true man sex everything it might just be because I m 22 . I don t know . I know that s a terrible thought thinking Einstein Newton and Gandhi all just wanted some pussy , but okay could be true , okay Stephen Hawking could uncover the entire universe We re in a million Nobel Prizes and still be like oh God damn it what must I do to get some motherfucking So you gotta bend this bitch Oh come on he s not here There s no disabled access Oh So all like the whole corporate world to me is just like misdirected sexual energy What are you doing in these corporate jobs ? 10 hours a day in some cubicle Hearing world like synergy productivity You re just selling glue sticks or some shit , huh ? All you can think about is damn I want to fuck Deborah from sales Got all these ridiculous job titles as well . I was talking to this person . I was like what do you do ? And they re like army digital media sales consultants Digital media fails consultants What does that mean ? You just you just post photos of glue sticks to Facebook , okay ? Tag a friend you ll stuck to like glue Oh Why is everyone in the corporate world a consultant ? I was a fucking consultant Like my dad he was in finance and he could never really tell me what he did How s always like dad what do you do ? He s like oh , I mean I m in finance Neil . </s> <s> I mean finance Like yeah , do you want to elaborate on that ? I know you won t understand . It s just finance Neil . It s just finance Finance just means money That s like a marine biologist saying oh , yeah , I mean water Now um I I want to talk about my personal feminist icon And I m serious Okay , Gina Reinhart . I love Gina love her You know , it s crazy . Why don t feminists ever talk about Gina Reinhart ? How is she not the god of feminism ? You know those t shirts that say this is what a feminist looks like it should have a picture of Gina Reinhart right there You don t only be able to make them enlarge but still If you don t know who Gina Reinhart is not only is she the richest woman in Australia richest person in Australia woman If you don t know what she looks like Google her She clearly does not give a fuck about what men think But no people don t like her There s a couple of reasons one is that she inherited a lot of money and yeah , she did she inherited 75 million dollars Now that s a lot of money , but she still turned that into 10 billion That s not bad How many of you if I gave you 75 million dollars ? How many of you would still be motivated to work ? How many of you would still be motivated to get out of bed in the morning ? Man if I had 75 million dollars , I wouldn t be working all day . I d be wanking all day . That s all I d be doing And what else people don t like her because she brings in workers from poorer countries And she pays them a subpar wage Now that sounds bad But let s not forget about the wage gap Women on average earn 77 cents to the dollar She s bringing in male workers paying them a subpar wage so she can profit Tell me that isn t the most gangster feminist shit you can do right there , okay Gina Reinhart is the dr . Dre of feminism Fucking that wage gap right up What What else she s in mining Famous generally very progressive care about the environment as do I but you have to admit When it comes to male dominated industries They don t get much more male dominated than mining I don t think third wave feminism is entered the depths of the minds just yet They probably just got used to first wave They re like oh fuck women can vote now . That s what they re up to And she dominated But no still they never talk about her instead there s always some blogger or some Female journalist who makes a groundbreaking speech about women in the media and it goes viral But nothing really changes all that changes is some male TV executive profits the most wage gap gets worse Gina Reinhart didn t care about women in the media she fucking bought half the media Mama Gina wanted a slice of that media pie So If you re sharing that groundbreaking speech just know that same male TV executive is on his knees licking the shit out of Gina Reinhart s asshole . Yeah , I love it And that s why I want to fuck Gina Reinhart Yeah Is I m a true male feminist I don t care about the patriarchal standards of beauty no I m attracted to power Ugly old rich men have all these young beautiful women jumping on their dicks I just want to turn those tables I just want to have be I just want to be her giggling little schoolboy Oh she can have her way with me Be 50 shades of Gina She can time me up put a diamond in her pussy and squat on my face . </s> <s> Yeah , get mining boy Oh Then if you take anything out of that show let it be that image right there , okay man This is a pretty crazy shit happening in the world man . It s been a pretty crazy year A lot of bad things happening What a like these terrorist attacks His mass shootings as well and you know , I think it s all sex related as well because it s always these young disenfranchised men who do these things Like it s always the same kind of guy who goes on a mass shooting isn t it A six foot four male model never shoots up a catwalk It s always some resentful virgin He s just in math class one day like oh x equals to fuck you all bang bang bang bang bang oh Everyone s like oh he needed god he needed god god would have saved him he needed god No , he didn t need god He needed to get late . That s what he needed If the government wants to prevent school shootings they don t need more churches . They need more brothels Not in some dark alleyway right next to the high school Oh Half price for students You know what the government should regulate sex In the same way of your poor the government gives you welfare money If you get to the last day of high school and you re still a virgin Fine you get the government hooker , okay Get it over and done with If a girl tops the state don t give her a scholarship Give her a night with Chris Hemsworth Yeah But at the same time the girl who comes last She has to fuck the fat guy from Borat So only fair Now think about it how much harder would everyone study No more dropouts No more underage drinking Education levels would soar Somebody call up the government tell them to implement the call Hacker high school sex program If you come first you get to come first Yeah And on the other side of the equation you ve got these brown guys committing these acts of terrorism And I think this is sex related as well because They think they re going to heaven to get 72 virgins That s what you get if you die as a martyr in the Muslim religion you go to heaven you get 72 virgins Now you gotta admit It s a little bit of an incentive What do you get in Christian heaven eternal bliss ? Well fuck that 72 virgins That s why there s no female terrorists Is 72 virgins that is heaven for men That would be hell for women No woman s idea of heaven is being surrounded By 72 Greasy 14 year old boys And I ll please take opportunity That s not heaven for anyone Except Catholic priests Hey , you know it s not offensive if I offend everyone Sydney thank you so much you guys may ask the thank you .

To yourself , if you ve been successful through that , the special is giving you a rise or fall on who you are , not who you pretend to be . Whoa . Hi , Mom . Hi .

Yeah , make it happen because I m about to get the middle of switching from breakfast to lunch . Oh . Just . . . just be yourself . That s three be yourself . I m wondering if you have any advice for me . I got blown . Is there ever a time when you find that you re just not fine ? What s up , T ? Not much , I didn t hear that . Going well , just getting ready for special . So , you , for sure , I m not going to be able to make it to introduce me . Yeah , I m not going to be able to be that . That s a bummer . Do you have any advice for me ? I d say actually be funny . Ha ha ha ha . On stage , it s always funny , and you re super funny at home . It s when he s trying to annoy me . He does the same thing , does the same thing to Jacob . Hey , Kate . Hey , daddy . You re 100 sure you won t be able to . . . won t be able to intro me , huh ? I m sorry , I m not going to be able to make it out . All right . Bye . I guess you re up , man . Oh , fuck you . Ladies and gentlemen , my dad , Joe Schmoll . Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! What s happening to you guys ? You know , yeah , everybody . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . First of all , thank you very much for welcoming me into this amazing City Boise . It s been amazing . You guys are so nice and so kind . Unless somebody says the word Boise , and then you lose your fucking minds , but . . . But we re not going to do that tonight . But thank you guys coming out . And first before I get started , I did want to address a few things . Somebody asked me backstage . They said , um , there are a couple of older folks in here . And do you change your material for the age of the people who are sitting in front of you ? </s> <s> And , uh . . . No ? Uh . . . I m gonna tell you why , too . My grandmother knocked that notion out of me quick . Because the first time she saw me , I was super nervous . I didn t want to swear in front of her , you know ? So she catches me backstage . And she goes , you look nervous . I said , I am , I m really nervous . And she said , why are you so nervous ? And I said , well , I don t want to swear in front of you , Nana . And she said , what word exactly do you not want to say ? And I said , well , I don t want to say fucking in front of you . And she said , sweetheart , I had to fuck for you to get here . And I was like . . . To the show , man , I had it given you a ride . Shit . I don t need you on the side of the road , like , my grandson needs to work . You know ? Well , here s the thing with my grandparents . And I will say this . I learned a lot from them about family . First of all , they were so funny . And they always infused humor into whatever we re doing . And they never used the word inappropriate . It was funny , it was funny . And I was like , man , I m gonna do that . And they also were all about family first . That was a big thing I learned from my grandparents family first . And I think I really took that into my family with my kids . You know , my youngest son , he tells me everything . He told me the first time he touched a boo . He walks into my room super serious , and he walks in and he goes , Hey . And I said , what s up ? He goes , who am I ? I said , what s going on ? He goes , no , no , no , no , no . Step outside . Now I ll tell you what I thought was happening . I thought he hit that age that every man hits . Where they look at their dad that first time and they think , Oh , beat the shit out of this dude . What ? Not everybody does it , but everybody looks at their dad at least once . Like , oh , tell me to take out the trash again . So we re walking outside . I m tightening up my shoelaces . I m like , oh , it s fucking all . I m okay . Here we go . And I m playing . I m just poking them in the neck once really hard to slow them down . And shit , you know , because he s bigger than me . I need to slow him down . He s a big dude . And we get outside and he goes , touch the boop . And I say , yeah ? What do you think ? He goes , well , I m definitely going to try to do that again . So now he did try to fight me . And I grew up with three older brothers . </s> <s> We all wrestled or fought my dad . At least once growing up . Anybody in here wrestle or fight their dad ? How old were you , man ? How old ? 12 . Not a lot of muscle tone on a 12 year old . 12 , huh ? How d that go for you ? Yes . You know what you learned early on as a young man ? Is that your dad takes it way more seriously than you do . You re like , I m going to mess with the old man . He s like , what the fuck ? Yeah , man . By the way , I asked some dude last week . I go , how are you ? And you fought your dad . He goes , 30 . I was like , oh , what s just beaten up an old man at that point in time , right ? But you know what he said ? He goes , yeah , well , it s the first time I thought I had a shot . And I m not mad at him . You go on where you think you got your shot . But I remember with my oldest brother the first time he decided he was going to fight my dad . So me and my other two brothers are in my room . We re all under the age of 10 . I m probably like six . My oldest brother is probably like 16 . And he walks into the room super serious , right ? He walks in and he s like , I m fighting dad today . And I m six . I m like , I m six . You fight dad ? That s right . I m fighting dad . You guys got my back . And we were all like , Fuck you . You got your back . We got your back . You guys , you guys ready for some new rules ? I m like , yeah , I want some new rules . He goes , what do you want ? I want to eat cereal for dinner . He s like , you got it . I m like , fuck that guy . Yeah . Oh , he was riling us up . I thought there was going to be a regime change , everybody . I needed to be on the right side of that shit , you know ? He had us riled up . I was grabbing pictures of my dad off the wall . Like , We re downstairs following him . He s like , you guys ready ? Yeah , we re ready . You guys got my back . We got your back . We get outside my dad s . And the patio , and he s smoking us a guard . He s sitting down . My brother walks out and he goes , we re fighting the hell , man . My dad stands up and he goes , okay . Now , hindsight being what it is . My dad s confidence should have been a bit of a red flag for my brother . Dude didn t even take the cigar out of his fucking mat . </s> <s> He knew he wouldn t get hit . You know what I mean ? Like , if you go to a fight and one of the guys has a cigar in his mouth , that s the fucking winner . That guy is like , I am confident as shit . So my brother goes , and let me tell you something . And before he could get another word out of his fucking mouth , my dad kicked him in the nuts so hard . And he fell on the ground , right ? And my dad walked up to him and goes , you know , you shouldn t talk and you fight , right ? And walked in the house like a fucking gangster . And we all walked past him like , yeah , you shouldn t talk with him like , think , think , think , think . Well , I m not hanging outside with a loser . I m going inside with a winner . Like , I m not stupid , you know . But he did try to fight me . So I m walking into the kitchen . He s walking out and he leans his shoulder into me . And I go , uh , did you just lean your shoulder into me ? And he goes , maybe you should watch where you re going . And I start laughing . I go , I m sorry . Are you starting to fight with me ? And he goes , uh , yeah , not that it s going to be much of a fight . And I was like , all right , man , front lawn right now . Let s go . And he goes , no , no , not now . Like three weeks . I m like , three . Who are you fucking Rocky ? What do you mean , three weeks ? You got to go turn some tires over your shit . He was like , I got to go look up some videos online . I m like , oh , okay . Now listen , outwardly , when he said three weeks , I was mocking him . But on the inside , when he said three weeks , I was like , the you . Because I m at an age where I pull muscles . And I pull muscles doing shit that I shouldn t pull a muscle doing . Like , not too long ago , I pulled a muscle in my right shoulder . Uh , uh , what ? Wiping my ass . I went back too quick and I didn t tuck my core . It s all core nowadays . I don t fucking know . But I went back too quick and all my wife heard what you walked by the door was , oh no ! Listen , guys , if I get a stretch before I shit , you can kill me tonight . You know what I m like ? If you walk into the bathroom later and I m like this and you re like , what are you doing , man ? I m getting ready to poop . Like , you can , I don t need to come out of the bathroom . </s> <s> You can kill me in there . Now , here s still , by the way , you couldn t do what my dad did now . This is definitely something you could not get away with now . We have raised a different generation of kids . You guys know that , right ? We have raised a generation of spoiled , entitled pussies . You understand that , right ? Now , we can clap all you want , but you know who s faulted is ? Yeah , they didn t raise themselves , guys . It s our fault . And we ve coddled them to the point that it s ridiculous . Do you know that in a lot of states in our great country , they ve outlawed Dodgebow ? Do you know why ? Because they say it humiliates the children . Rattle applause , by the way , that s ironically why we played the fucking game to begin with . Right ? I was like , who are we making cry today ? Right ? Rattle applause , people who remember playing Dodgebow . Rattle applause . Right , and if I said after the show , we re going to clear on the table as a place of Dodgebow , who would play some Dodgebow ? Because we all have that shared experience , right ? Everybody in here remembers what that red rubber tastes like on your lips . Right ? And your eyes are watering , your nose starts to run , you try to get off the court . Nine other balls hit you and you re like , I m out already , shit , fuck , I am out ! They ll never have that experience , real bad . So I call my dad on the phone , because I know my son wants to fight me . I call him on the phone , I m like , hey man , we all fought you , right ? He goes , yeah . And I said , I seem to remember you being a little more violent than you needed to be . And he said , no , yeah , you remember correctly . And I said , why ? Why , why , why ? And he goes , listen man , he wants to win , right ? I said , yeah , he said , you have to win . You have to win , because if you don t win , the power changes at your house . And then you try telling him to take out the trash tomorrow . He s going to slap you in the face and be like , you take the trash out , bitch , don t make me fuck you up again . And I was like , oh my god , he said , this is how . . . And then he said something , by the way , that I will never forget . I go , I have to win , he said , Josh , even if somebody ends up calling the police . </s> <s> You have to win . And I was like , oh my god . Now listen , I m not a violent dude . My dad was more adept at that . And now I did have three older brothers , so I am really good at mental torture . So I was like , that s kind of where Alina , so I hang up the phone , and I turn around and my wife is there . And she looks right at me . She goes , are you fighting Jacob ? And I said , no , no , I m not going to fight him . It s going to be something we re going to do something in the front line , but it s not going to be like a fight . And she said , why don t you just tell him that you re the grown up and he s the kid ? And that s it . He does what you say . And I m like , nah . I said , that s not going to work . And she said , why ? I said , I m not sure if you were there , but he basically slapped me in the face with his dick in the kitchen . Like , there s only one response . She goes , I don t like it . I said , I m not saying it s the right response . I m just saying it s the only one that I know , do you know ? And she said , I don t think this is a good idea . And then I maybe got a little too cocky . And I said , I ll let you know when I have a bad idea . And she was like , oh , okay . You re going to let me know . And I said , yeah . And she goes , oh , okay . Now listen , you don t have these problems with daughters . Like , I don t have that problem . My daughter has challenged me to a fight . The only problem I ever had with my daughter is that she s been smarter than me since she was six . And like half the time when we were sitting in our living room , I didn t understand a word that was coming out of her mouth . Like , we need my living room . I d be like , what s up , baby ? She s like , I m like a daddy . I m like a daddy . I m like a daddy . I m like a daddy . It s like having a fucking dolphin in my living room , right ? She tells me everything , too . She came home one day and she was like , oh , my god , daddy . I have to tell you something . It s so important . I m like a daddy . I m like a daddy . I m like a daddy . I m like a daddy . </s> <s> I m like a daddy . I m like a daddy . I m like a daddy . I m like a daddy . Chris tried to kiss me . And I was like , oh , my god . So what happened , baby ? She said , oh , my god , daddy . I told him I wasn t sure if I was allowed to do that . I had to go home and ask my daddy . And I said , you know what , babe ? Thank you very much , Rask . Look , I know your teenager and your hormones are running crazy . And you don t know what to do . You know , it s hard , hard time . And hormones are up and they re down . And look , I know it s a hard time . And I can tell you what to do if you re not to do , because I don t think that s my job as your father . My job as your father is just to tell you what I know . And what I know is , is that God doesn t let little hookers into heaven . Do whatever you want to do with that information , babe . I m going to get that in . I don t know what to tell her , guys . She s hanging her out teenage boys . Teenage boys are the single biggest predator that walked this planet earth . They re not in control of what s happening here . It s not there . Oh , any man , any guy in here will tell you things used to pop up all the time for no apparent reason . And it was confusing to us . I remember sitting in math class , like . . . And the teacher always thought I was cheating . I was just checking to see if anybody else was hard . And I m like , like . . . Guess nobody likes geometry as much as I do . And I remember what s up . The teacher was like , Mr . Wolf , you can leave . Math class is over . No , I can t . I picked a bad day to wear sweatpants as all I m going to tell you . Me and the chick who just got our period for the first time , we re going to hang out here for a little while . You don t mind it ? A terrible age that was . I ll tell you something about my daughter , man . You learned really early on with her . She is a ride or die person . If you are on her team , she is on your team forever . Here s when I knew there was no snitch in her . When I met my wife , I was a single and I was raising three kids , right ? And in my deal , she and I both decided we were like , look , it s not important for her to meet the kids until we know we re going to get married . </s> <s> Because neither one of us thought it was good for her to start a relationship with them until we knew it was a forever relationship for us , right ? So she used to come over after the kids went to sleep and then she would go home . So one night , it s late and she says to me , I can t really drive home tonight , I m too tired . And I was like , well , babe , the first time the kids meet you can t be tomorrow morning in my bed . That is not okay . She said , I know , but I don t know what to do . And I said , do you want me to get your car and then I ll get your car back here tomorrow and you can drive car home . And she said , I m just so tired . She said , do you mind if I just sleep in your closet ? And I was like , so let me just see if I got this right . You re coming over and we re dinner . We re going to have sex . And then you re going to sleep in the closet ? And she was like , yeah , and I go , okay . But so she goes to sleep in the closet . Next morning , in my deal with the kids was , I make breakfast , I make lunch , you get your cell s dressed . So my daughter runs in and I m cooking breakfast . And she goes , daddy , I can t find my shoes . And I go , babe , you know , I m making breakfast . I can t help you out . And she goes , I don t know where I looked everywhere . And I said , you didn t look everywhere . Go find the shoes . So about three minutes later , she runs in and she goes , yeah , I still can t find my shoes and there s a stranger sleeping in your closet . And I go , okay , babe , thank you . I said , I ll help you find your shoes . And she goes , okay , I go , just had a curiosity , Kate , there s a stranger sleeping in my closet . That s the reaction , I get . And on our way out of the kitchen , she goes , it s your closet , daddy . I don t know what happens in your closet . And I was like , well , I m going to bury some bodies with that girl . That s you . So I know I got to start torturing my son , right ? I call my brother on the phone because I m like , you guys tortured me endlessly . What should I do ? And he said , what do you mean ? All you talked about growing up was , I wish I had a little brother so I could do to him what you guys did to me . He goes , now is your chance . Nobody gets to go back and do that . And I was like , you know , you re right . This is quite an opportunity . </s> <s> And he said , yeah , man , do you want me to send you over the list ? And I go , what list ? He goes , oh , the list of things that we had that we used to do to you . And I said , why do you still have the list ? And he was like , you never know , do you ? And I couldn t know . So he sends the list over , right ? And I m looking at it and he said , just remember the most important thing is to start small and go up from there . So this all started on a Sunday . Now listen , he wants three weeks . I don t want to give him a full three weeks . I want to get this . I want to get him so mad , my son , that he wants to fight at the end of the week . I need to get him so mad because that s the only chance I have of beating him , right ? So my brother s like , start slow . Like , okay . I m going to get a snack when my son is sleeping . I took all of his underwear out of his drawer . And I replaced it with panties with the days of the week on it . So when he woke up the next morning , I m a cook and breakfast , and I hear from the other room , I hear , what ? What is this ? Hey , these aren t my underwear . These aren t my underwear ! And I just yelled back , hey , just put your Mondays on sunshine and come on out for some breakfast . And he was like , I m going to fight you so hard ! And I was like , don t say that . Don t say that . Don t say that . I hope you re not fighting me hard . But they re easily manipulated . Anybody who has teenage boys knows the teenage boys are dumb as shit . So dumb ! So dumb ! Even if you have a smart kid , he is dumb as shit . Both of my sons are smart . They are dumb , dummy , dumb , dumb . Jacob had some friends over once , right ? Or 14 at the time . And all I hear is from the room . Oh . Oh , oh , oh . By the way , every teenage boy sounds like that . If you every teenage boy is a cross between Rocky and Forrest Gump . Every teenage boy is somewhere between , yo , Adrian ! And Jennie ! Like , you re somewhere in that fucking . So all I hear is , ho ho , ho ho , ho ho ho . I m like , what the fuck is going on in there ? It s laughing for 15 minutes straight , right ? And I hear dad come in here , come in here . So I go in there . Before the boys are on one bed with one of those laser pointers that cats chase , and the other boys on a wall like this . Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh . My son goes , you should use that on stage . I m like , I m gonna . </s> <s> You see it ? They re easily manipulated . And they re just , they don t think because their teenage , this is my son s one of his greatest ones , right ? I got an iPad for a gift . And I didn t know how to set it up . So I gave it to him . And I go , man , will you set this up for me ? I don t know how to do it . He goes , yo , and he brings it back later , and he goes , here you go , dad , all set up . Just so you know , your iPad is to cloud . Everything from everybody s devices goes to your iPad . Everybody hearing that ? Everything from everybody s devices , my iPad . So I m scrolling through pictures in the road , seeing what I want to post , you know , looking through , looking through , looking through . And as a man , when you re sitting on your own bed , looking at your own iPad , looking at your pictures , you never want this sentence to leave your mouth . I stop on a picture and I go , well , that s not my dick . LAUGHTER Now , at first , I thought somebody was sending my wife dick pics , and I had that one beat . So I wasn t even going to say anything to her , you know what I mean ? I was going to be like , keep looking at that skinny dick babe . I feel pretty good about my stuff . It s not going to be as funny when I come out of the shower doing the helicopter tomorrow , is it ? Is it ? But then I recognized the IKEA desk that I had built for my son behind the dick and I was like , oh my God , I built that desk and that dick ! LAUGHTER He sent the people to dick pics ! So I go down into his room , I m like , hey , man , he goes , yeah . I go , you know , explain to me again how the cloud works . And he was like , oh , you re so stupid . LAUGHTER And I was like , yeah , no , we ll see . LAUGHTER I said break it down from me real slow if you can . He was okay , dad . You take a picture on your phone and it goes to the iPad . I m like , what else ? He was like , mom takes a picture on her phone and it goes to the iPad . I m like , what else ? He was like , I take a picture on my phone and oh no . LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Hey , can I see that iPad ? LAUGHTER And I said , no , no , not yet . He goes , okay . And then he goes , so . . . How s your day going ? LAUGHTER I said earlier today , not great . Right now , I m having a fucking time , I love ! LAUGHTER CHEERING CHEERING You mean , that s good , dad , because you know when you re in a good mood , we re all in a good mood , so . </s> <s> . . And then he said something that did make me laugh . He goes . . . Well , thanks for stopping by . LAUGHTER He tried to pull the Jedi mind trick on me , some shit . And then he said , these are not the dick pics you re looking for . LAUGHTER LAUGHTER So I go , I think I m going to stick around for a little bit and he goes , oh , okay . What a treat . LAUGHTER And he said , so . . . Did you have a question you wanted to ask me ? LAUGHTER And I said , did you have a question you wanted to ask me ? And he goes , oh sure , I ll go first . LAUGHTER And I was girlfriend s name s Ashley , right ? And he goes , oh . . . Oh , are there any pictures of . . . Ashley s boobs under ? LAUGHTER And I go , Jacob , are there pictures of a naked , underaged girl on my iPad ? LAUGHTER And he goes , well , not if you didn t see him , there , aren t you ? I go , no dude , it s this . And he goes , oh , that s just my dick . What is that ? LAUGHTER And he said , I m so glad you saw that . What do you think about that angle ? I go , no , no , no . We re close . We re not checking each other s dick pics close . Like , that s not what s going down . And I finally had to tell him . Finally had to tell him . Look , don t send dick pics . The penis does not photograph well . LAUGHTER I told him . Nobody is ever looking at a picture of a dick and been like , I love this picture . LAUGHTER Amber ! And I tell him , I think I know how you think women react when they get a picture of your dick . It s how you react when you get a boob on their phone . When a teenage boy gets a boob on his phone , they lose their mind . There have been a couple times when I ve just heard this from the living room . Yes ! They look like , yeah , t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t Pewdiepie ! They do the titty dance the whole thing . That is not how you women react when you get a picture of a dick , right ? Just so you know , when a woman gets a dick pic , she goes like this . LAUGHTER Followed by this . Stacey Leick ! LAUGHTER Because she has showed your dick to everybody . You know , you don t like that shit . LAUGHTER APPLAUSE And anybody who has teenage boys too knows that they lie , lie , lie . </s> <s> That s all they do . And you know how you know they re lying ? Because their mouth is moving . They lie . But here s the thing . Sometimes you don t bust them with all of them . And sometimes their lies are so good that you re almost proud of them . You know what I mean ? You re like , and don t do that again . That s my fucking boy . You know ? My son s best . He ran a game on me . Ran a game on me . My wife and I , we went to Hawaii for vacation . And my parents came to stay with him . So when we come back , we got a direct TV bill a month later . And there s 200 worth of porn charges . LAUGHTER And we re looking at the bill , right ? My wife and I , and I m mad . I m mad . I m mad , mad . Right ? The dude needs to be taught a lesson . Because porn is free . Like how dumb do you have to be ? LAUGHTER I got porn in my pocket 24 hours a day . I m worried about him as a human being . If he s still paying for porn , that is the dumbest motherfuckin shit I ve ever heard of . I m worried about him walking around in this world . If he s still paying for porn , like , how s he going to do that ? LAUGHTER I tell my wife , I m like , I gotta go down and talk to him . This is so dumb . But here s the deal . I feel like this is gonna be a quick conversation . Because his MO , when he lies , is he a lie . And then if you just show him facts , he s like , you know that was me . And that s it . So I have the facts in my hand . I have the bill in my hand . So I figure it s gonna be quick conversation . So I go down into his room . And I m like , hey , man . And he goes , Joe . I go , you know anything about this ? And here s how I can tell he was gonna lie to me . Because as soon as I held up the bill , he bent over . And he squinted . Like , he couldn t read all of a sudden . He was like . . . LAUGHTER I just started shaking his head . Like , he had never seen that language before . He was like . . . LAUGHTER And then he said something so ridiculous . He goes , you know , I m not familiar . I m like , what the fuck does that mean ? You re not familiar . You don t recognize English . Or you don t know what that is . And he goes , I m not sure what that list is . I m like , it s porn . He goes , oh ! I go , you don t know anything about that porn ? </s> <s> He goes , no . I go , you didn t order that porn . He goes , no . I go , you didn t order that porn . He goes , no . I go , oh , because I m looking at the dates . When the porn was ordered , it s when your mom and I were out of town . And the only people at the house were you and . . . Grandma and Grandpa ? LAUGHTER LAUGHTER So it was either you or . . . Grandma and Grandpa ? And he looks behind that many and he goes , well , they do like each other a lot . LAUGHTER And I was like , take it easy there , man . You know you re talking about my mom , right ? You re talking about my mom right now . I said , you re saying my mom watches porn ? And he goes , no , I didn t say that . You said that . LAUGHTER And I m like , why is he so confident ? I have to bill . I have it right here . Why ? And I said , OK , I m not going to make him so uncomfortable that he ll admit it . And he doesn t want to talk about porn with his dad . So I guess I ll just start reading off the titles of the movies . LAUGHTER So I said to him , I go , are you telling me , like , Grandma and Grandpa were in my room watching . . . Anel Party 3 ? LAUGHTER And this is the quote out of his mouth . He goes , well , the door was shut all weekend . LAUGHTER I said , are you saying my mom watches Anel ? He goes , no , you said that . I never said that . LAUGHTER Guys , I walked into the room 100 sure it was him . Now I m at like 99 . And I m like , what ? LAUGHTER LAUGHTER And then I realized the reason he was so confident . You know why he was so confident , everybody ? The reason he was so confident was the only way I can truly prove that it was him . Is if I call my parents . LAUGHTER And I said , did you watch Anel Party 3 ? LAUGHTER In my room . And on the off chance , they say , yes , I ve got to burn the fucking house down . Like , I can t live there as an adult male . If my parents are watching Anel on your bed , you re going to burn that shit down . LAUGHTER So I need to . . . I ve said , all of a sudden I ve become Tom Cruise from a few good men . Did you order the porn ? Like , I needed to know , right ? So I decided he s gone all in . He knows I don t want to call my parents . The only way I can bust him is if I go all in too . So I m like , OK , I m going all in with this . And I say to him , I go , man , you didn t order the porn . </s> <s> You didn t order the porn ? And then he did say what every teenager says at least once . And I said , you didn t order the porn ? And he s like , I wish you just believe me . Gaww ! LAUGHTER Ah ! You never believe me . Oh ! How do you go , no , man ? I believe you . And he goes , what ? Because I figured I m pushing all my chips in too . The only way to get him into admitted is to get him into a situation that he doesn t want to be in . So I said , yeah , man . I believe you . And I think it s terrible that Grandmah and Grandpa are making you pay for their porn . He was like , yeah , I think that s terrible too . LAUGHTER I said , we can t let him hide in the shadows out there in the East Coast . We got to call him out . And he was like , I agree with you . I was like , what do you think , man ? And I held up my phone . I go , let s just get him on the phone . And he looks at me dead in the eye and he goes , call him . LAUGHTER And I m like , what ? And he goes , no , no , no , call him , call him dead . I want to hear you call your parents and ask them if they watched Aino Party 3 in your room . I want to hear you ask that question . Call him . I go , I m gone . And he goes , I m right here . And I was like , so I start to dial one number . Dial another number . And he goes , you don t have your parents on speed dial ? And I said , I do , I m just taking , I m going slow . I m giving you a chance to come clean . And he goes , oh , okay . And he goes , I wouldn t say come clean when you talk to them . And I was like , listen , guys , if this is a fight , he s landed every fucking punch so far . And I m like , okay , I m pressing another button . Pressing another button . Guys , I m at like the eighth button . I m like , I m about to ask my parents if they watched Aino Party 3 . And then I m going to jump out of a window like this is it for me . I m about to press that ninth button . And he goes , well , I ll pay for it . And I said , you ordered the porn ? And he goes , no , that was grandma and grandpa . I just don t want you to embarrass them . I think it s nice how much they like each other . And I was like , it looks like he s dead of the eye . And he goes , we done here ? And I was like , yeah , I guess so . But that wasn t satisfactory to me , guys . I needed to hear him say he ordered the porn , right ? So we get to the outside of his door . </s> <s> And I m on the outside of it . And I go , hey , I met before I leave . I m going to give you one last offer . I will pay the bill and give you 200 . All you got to do is say you ordered the porn . And he looks right at me and he goes , nope . Grandma and grandpa . No ! And now every time he walks by my room and the door is open , he looks in and he goes , I wouldn t sleep on that bed . Like an asshole . I don t feel too bad when I m doing it to him . We re at day three , back checking in , back in the fight . And I started to up my battle a little bit . And I started to do something and my parents , my brothers , did to me that I hated . I put Vaseline in basically every pocket that he had . Jack your pocket , pant pocket , anything . Oh , that will drive you slowly crazy , right ? And I could hear him going , oh , I m going to fight you so hard . And then it was funny because my wife calls me into the bedroom . Is she going to come in here ? I go , sure . And I look on the mirror and written in Vaseline on the mirror . I can t wait to fight you . And she goes , you happen with yourself and I go , yeah , actually , I m pretty happy . I go , he just wrote a death wish when Vaseline , he s read this nap . Like he s , I m not going to have to wait 12 days . He s ready to go right now , right ? And it s so funny . It really is . The funniest thing about kids is they don t think that we experience what they experience . Like we were teenagers . We did what you did . Like they think that you wouldn t understand . Oh , no . Like he thinks he s the only person that never broke something in a house and just pretended like it ever happened . Oh , I didn t do that . You guys , remember doing that , Chip ? Were you break something when you were a kid and you just throw the pieces out ? Like that lamp never existed . Like your parents , two grownups are going to walk into the living room and just notice that one of the two lamps that isn t there . I m like , what the fuck ? That s how dumb teenagers are . They re dumb as shit . I dropped a keg on a hardwood floor in my house growing up when my parents were out of town . We had a party . It was in the dining room . I just slid the dining room table and rug over nine inches . </s> <s> Like , don t , don t never notice . It s the first thing my mom noticed where she walked in . She was like , why is the table there ? I m like , how d you notice ? She was like , I m a grownup . Now , we all know pitfalls of being a teenager , right ? So you have to decide which ones you want to warn your kids about and how you should warn them . I think we ve all changed how we warn our kids about drinking and driving . Now , the message is easy . Call an Uber , call an ift , a lift . I ll pay for everything . There s no excuse for it to ever happen . And I know all the people that I know have kids are very vocal about that now . And I don t know too many teenage kids that are drinking and driving anymore because of that . We re pretty clear on this message now . But there s other things that you don t , you know they re going to run into that you don t tell them about . Because how would you ? Like , my daughter ? Look , one of the pitfalls that I knew my daughter was going to run into , my daughter , my princess , my baby girl . The smartest young woman that I know . But I knew that my daughter , my baby girl , you know what pitfall I knew she was going to fall for ? You knew what I knew she was going to fall for ? I knew that my daughter was going to fall for just the tip . How did I know she was going to fall for that ? Because you fell for it and you fell for it and you fell for it and you fell for it . You all fucking fell for something . If you didn t fall for just the tip , you fell for it . I just want to lay naked next to you . Just one pump . I want to know what it feels like . Don t shake your fucking hands . You all fell for something . And that s what I knew . I m like , she s going to fall for that shit . And by the way , it s not that I don t want her to have sex . I m not that guy who s like , oh , I know that s going to happen . But the tip is where the bad stuff comes from . The tip makes me , makes babies . I don t want that shit . I don t want babies . I d rather have a guy say just the nuts . Fine , dude . Stuff your nuts in there . I got no problem with that . Stuff nuts . I m going to run for office under stuffed nuts . Looks like it . Looks like it feels great stuffed nuts . </s> <s> No kids . That s all I m saying . It s so funny to see them do shit that I did . I remember the first time I found my son drunk in my kitchen , my oldest son . And here s the thing . He was , here s how you can tell someone s drunk . You can tell their drunk by what two foods they re combining together . Because if you re eating chips and salsa , you re not that drunk . He was dipping chicken into peanut butter . Sitting in the corner of the kitchen like this . And he was like , this is delicious . And he even said , I think this is how they discovered pre season . So I was like , hey man , get , put the chicken in the peanut butter down . Get upstairs dude . This is embarrassing . He was like , oh man . And he goes upstairs . And I was way up the stairs . I said to him , hey just so you know man , not chicken and peanut butter ? That s not going to be good for you later . And I was right . Because I heard that , we ve all heard that , right ? That late night run to the bathroom . Your body is amazing . Your body is amazing for this reason . You can pass out . As a man , I passed out . Dude , they ve put their nuts on my cheek . They ve traced their digs on my forehead . They squirt shit all over you . You don t wake up . But you got a puke and your body s like , and sends you off running in a direction , right ? So I hear running down the hallway . And then there s silence . And then I just hear , ah ! This isn t fun anymore . Silence , and keerst . Aaaaah ! And my favorite . I swear to God ! If you let me stop throwing up . I m going to fucking get you . I m going to fuck you up . I m going to fucking get you . I m going to fucking get you ! I m going to fucking get you . I m going to fucking get you . I will never drink again . And then he did a couple of them , what I like to call my favorite , the silent scream . You know when you re like , I don t feel so good , I do . I really heard my stomach , that hurts so much , I hope that never happened . But your abs never look better that next day , right ? Come down . Let me do some more of those . And by the way , I don t want to be feeling bad for them about things that I do to them . </s> <s> They get me just as much . You understand that ? That s part of the thing in our family . Funny is funny , funny wins . And I scare really easily . And my daughter scared me because I also smoke a lot of weed . And . . . Thank you . And so my daughter scared me one time . She hid in the front yard . So they know that I come home high every now and then . And she was waiting in the front yard in a long white , flowy gown and a scream mask . I walked into the yard and she was like , and I jazz hand when I get scat . I make a laugh when I jazz hand . There s like a million videos they have with me going like , so fuck them , they get everything . But I knew my son was getting ready to lose his mind , right ? And I started to step up my game . And I did something to him that my brothers did to me that used to drive me crazy . They used to put the basketball sauce on my fingertips when I was sleeping . Well , because the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning is what ? You go pee . Anybody who s ever touched a jalapeno and then gone to the bathroom ? Yeah , that s not fun . So I put the basketball sauce on his fingertips and I just wait . I wait five in the morning . I get up . I sit in the living room . And I hear him go to the bathroom and then he walks . He walks into the living room . And he goes , hey . And he goes , what does it mean ? What does it mean if your penis is on fire ? It could mean a lot of things . I said , well , you could have a virus . What do you do that if you have a virus ? What do you do ? I m a lady . Take a needle . You stick it in the base of your penis . What a penis shot . I don t want one of those . What else ? What else ? What other way ? Is there another option ? I go , well , yeah , I said , you could have a bacterial infection . Oh , okay . What is that ? What does that mean ? How do they fix that ? I go , well , they take a needle . And they stick it in the base . Oh , another penis shot . Well , I don t want to . Is there any option besides penis shot ? I go , there s one , the third one , but it s so rare . It never happens . He s like , what is it ? I m like , he just doesn t happen . He goes , what is it ? Is there a penis shot ? I go , no . He goes , tell me what it is . I go , okay , I go , it s possible , but it never happens . </s> <s> But it s possible . It s somebody snuck in your room and put the basketball sauce on . Your favorite dish when you re sleeping . And he was like , I m going to bite you so hard . I m like , don t say that . Don t say that . Now look , we re buddies . We really are buddies . And he tells me everything . He told me , in some things I want to hear and some things I don t . Some things are just too much . Like , he came home excited one night and he was like , hey , I m going to ask you a couple questions . I might make it a little uncomfortable . And I was like , did you not want to ask a friend ? And he was like , no , that you because you know , I don t want to ask him , I get embarrassed . I m like , okay , he goes , okay , so , okay . So you know , I m going to go on a holiday and we re going to be alone together . We re going to be doing some things I ve never done before . So I just got a couple questions . He goes , we re going to be kissing . And my eyes are going to be shut . I go , yes . Don t be creepy , open eye kissing , guys . That s the worst . You know when you re kissing somebody and you crack your eye like this and they re like this . And you re like , well , fuck tonight tonight , I guess . I don t know why you be staring at me from an eighth of inch away . You psycho . I go , yeah , dude , eyes , eyes definitely , definitely close . He goes , good . Question number one , answer . And he goes , you know what I know what to do here . And his bra move is terrible . But I didn t want to tell him how to do a bra because I left high school not knowing how to do a bra . You ve got to figure it out yourself . Look , guys , when I wanted to see boobs in high school , my bra move is this . You know when you re putting a top of the titties and it like cuts them in half and you re like , why are they so sad ? It s like , yeah , man . He goes , you know what I know what to do . And then he goes , and then dad , and he starts to do this . And he s looking right at me . He goes , and then dad , and I m like , oh , I knew I should have gotten high for this conversation . </s> <s> It s walking his fingers down his stomach . And he goes , then dad , and this is exactly what he said . Then dad , this is where I hear things get a little tricky . I said , yeah , whoever told you that was right . They do it again . He said , you know because the lights are on , my eyes are going to be closed . So I don t , how do you , like when you , how dad , how do you , like when you , like , how dad , and he goes , let me start over . Okay , kissing , eyes closed . Boobies , no one to do there . Take a walk down the tricky town . Here we are . And he said , what I need to know from you , dad , is when , like when you re , like when you re , when dad would you , you know . This is getting kind of awkward , isn t it ? I did , I said , dude , we are so far past awkward . I am on suicide watch . Can you just ask me the question ? Okay , dad , I ll ask you , like when you re doing it , when you re , how , when you , how do you touch a woman s banana , dad , how do you do that ? And I was like , you want me to tell you how , that s gross . I don t know , dude , you re , I don t know . And I said , you think I m going to give you my secrets ? I m not giving you my secrets . I worked hard for those secrets . Every man in America , we also hard for those secrets . Try it , try it , try it , try it , try it , try it , try it . Some shit works , some shit doesn t . You try something else . Look , every man in America stumbled out of the gates . You think I m going to kick you to the finish line ? Fuck you . Figure it out like the rest of us did . Look , you don t go from a princess to sorcerer in one day . That s all I m saying . Pretty sure it took Harry Potter , seven movies . I don t fucking know . Eight , whatever . I m just saying the first time I went down a girl s pants , it would have been nice if somebody had told me , but nobody ever told me , but would have been nice the first time I went down a girl s pants , if somebody had told me that the whole was so far back . I was pushing around here for like 20 minutes . I m like , what s the deal ? Is it going to pop open or do I need a password for this ? Little pig , little pig , let me in . And then when I finally hit a hole , I thought , I m so far back , I m in the wrong one for sure . </s> <s> I skipped over the vagina . And then when I realized I was in the right place , teenage boys are the worst . When I finally realized I was in the right place , I just left my finger there like I was taking her temperature or something . No movement or anything , just this the whole time . Like she was a Thanksgiving turkey and I was just waiting for it . I think I might even have leaned in and was like , does that feel good , baby ? So bad . So I m like , listen , right now we re at the house . We re at day five and he s ready to snap . After the vacillation , I know he s ready to snap . So I do the thing to him that my brothers did to me that made me snap the quickest . They used to lock me in my bathroom . Oh yeah , for hours . Now I wasn t going to lock him in for hours , just like an hour and a half , so I m like , okay . And so when he s in the bathroom , I take some rope and I tie it to the handle and tie the other part of the rope to the doorbell . Tor , the door , out of the door handle . And I just sit and I wait . And I hear the toilet flush . And then I just hear the door handle . And I get a text . I m locked in the bathroom . So I send him a text back . I know . And then it was just like in a horror movie , all from the inside of the bathroom , all I heard is , are you out there ? And I said , you know I am . He goes , you let me out of here right now . I ll break the door down . And I pick up my phone and I m like , break it down . Has anyone in here ever seen someone try to break down the door ? That s some funny shit . The first time I saw it , I was in college . And my buddy was like , I m being the shit out of this guy . And I go , let s go . And he goes to his house and the door was locked . And he was like , I m breaking in . I go , break it . And my buddy went , and his lip went , because it s a fucking door , everybody . That s why they put it up there . So you can t walk in and out . I ll really nilly . If you think you can break down the door , you watch too much law and order . That s all I m saying . The door . So he goes , I m gonna break it down .

It s quiet for like two , three minutes . And then he goes , he goes , I m pretty sure this is child abuse . And I said , yeah , which part ? </s> <s> He goes like , dig all of it . Silence for like another three minutes . And then he said something that made me laugh so hard . I had to leave the room . I just hear from the bathroom . I m hungry . Oh , it s like , come back in the room . And this is what I knew he started crack . He goes , dad , dad , listen . Listen . If you crack the door and slip into sandwich , I promise not to try to get out . I m like , oh , fucking Stockholm syndrome is sitting anywhere this dude . Negotiating with his captors and stuff , you know ? I go , I can t do that , man . He was like , oh , this one I knew he was ready to fight . I just heard him starting to mumble to himself . Oh , oh . Oh . Oh , oh , oh . And then he said this . He goes , when I get out of here , I m just gonna shake him . And I was like , fuck . I ve never been so mad when I m like , I m just gonna shake him . I was like , oh , he s ready to fight . I go , you ready to come out , man ? And he goes , you re all ready . And I go , okay . And I open the door . You ve ever seen a bull come out of a shoot at a rodeo ? Or all their muscles are moving at once . And he s come at it . He s like , I m gonna bite you so hard . And I go , you ready ? Because I m ready . I go , let s go . He goes , not yet . I got to change into my bike clothes . Is that ? So I got on the hallway and I see my wife bath and she s like , listen . Are you sure you still wanna fight him ? I go , he just , he was just talking about shaking somebody . So he s gonna fight somebody today . So , it might as well be me . And she said , this is nothing good is gonna come out of this . Nothing good . Even if you win , nothing good comes out of this . She said , I really think it s a bad idea . And I said , what did I tell you about that ? I ll let you know when I have a bad idea . And she was like , okay . And I go , just do me a favor . Just put my phone in the window . Because when I pin in , that s gonna be the end of the wedding video . Like , that s a good way to go out . Wedding video over . Me pinning him , right ? And she goes , okay . So I walk outside . And when I walk outside , guys , I m pretty happy with myself . </s> <s> For a couple of reasons . One , I didn t have to get his violin . As my dad did to get him this bad , right ? And two , look , whatever you all think about it . Nobody in here remembers the stories about when you were a kid . How many times your mom cut the crust off your sandwich . You don t remember the nice stuff . You were like , you remember when fucking Tommy fell off the roof ? Do you know what I mean ? Those are the stories you tell . And I know this is a story . He s gonna tell . This is a memory we re gonna share . And I like that shit . And when he looks back , he s gonna think , man , that was bunny as shit , right ? And I m happy . And then he comes busting out of the house . The following way , you want to know what his mic clothes were ? Gene Sharks . No shirt and a bandana . I was like , where are you going ? Coachella ? Like , what the fuck ? And he comes running at me . He throws a punch . I duck it . I throw him over my hip and bam . He lands on his back . You guys know that noise ? He s hooked with all the air just hooked .

That s the name of the fur , you know , fur in the moment . That s all I had . And I go to push him when I push his leg slipped . And when this leg slip , a disc popped in my back . And I land there right on him . And I knock the wind out of him again . And he s like , get up on me , get up on me . And I was like , get out from under me , get out from under me . </s> <s> And we re both laying there like a couple of wetmops in the front yard . 30 seconds later , he gets out from under me and walks inside and I m laying in the front .

She walks out and she leans over me just like this and she goes . How do you think that went ? I said , I think it went pretty well . And she said , did it ? I said , I won . She goes , did you ? She said , all I know is that he s inside drinking water and you re still laying out here with your face in the dark . He looks like the winner . I go , yeah , but we re going to cut the video off way before that . Nobody s ever going to see that shit . And I said , babe , and I knew why she came out . She came out to tell me that she was right and I was wrong . And she was . And I was going to let , I told her right off the front . I said , look , I know you were right and I was wrong and I m so sorry . And I am the adult and he is the child . And I really just need to keep that in mind . Like , this is how you re parent . We re parent together and I m sorry we didn t do this together and I should have listened to you . But thank you very much for coming out to help me in . And she said , I think I m here to help you with it . She said , I came out here to tell you that the camera is still running in the window . And I think I m going to start a little video now . Because the sprinklers are set to come on and three minutes . And as she s walking away , I go , babe , I don t think that s a good idea .

That feels good . That s all the time I needed to fill . I appreciate that . Thank you , man . It feels great . I m feeling good . I actually just recently had to go to the gym . I was like , oh , I m going to be a little bit more just recently had to go to the emergency room though and I had some stomach virus thing . I almost called an ambulance . It s weird even considering calling that ambulance for yourself . You know , you call an ambulance for other people , right ? Are you supposed to say about yourself ? Can you come get me ? I don t feel so good . Just come on and I ll be lying on a floor . I m just looking at the phone going , I don t know how to do this . I don t know what to do . It was at night so I drove myself to the emergency room . That s a nice relaxing drive . No , after you . Merge , everybody . Merge . I m only imploding . I pull up at the entrance to the emergency room . No valet parking . I mean , if that s not the biggest oversight in our solar system , but there s every time where you want to go , can you park this because I need to collapse the meeting ? No , I m circling around a parking lot . Can I park there ? I think I m going to die . I m dying too . Okay , go ahead . I ll go up a couple levels . Come on . Come on . I don t care if you re driving yourself or someone else to the emergency room . You still want to get out and run in with them . Are you supposed to drop somebody off and go park a car ? Okay , you go in . Tell them you re shot . Ask them if they validate . I m leaving . So I finally park , you know . I go in and check in . They ask the most insulting question when you check into a hospital . What seems to be the problem ? What seems ? Well , it seems . It seems like everything on my inside wants to be on my outside . But I m no doctor . What kind of kind of sudden in question ? So they check me into my luxurious half room . He s a curtain down the middle with a mystery patient on the other side . And he s moning over there . They re never going to help me with him moning like that . So I got to outmone him , you know . Oh , yeah . What moning wrong hurting ? The whole floor is like a haunted choir . </s> <s> It s got to be hell to work and it s environment . So I m killing time , arriving . Nurse , finally comes in . How are you doing tonight ? I m on it . Jeremy . Do you have a pain killer or something ? This is killing me . So she goes , how would you describe your pain ? It s killing . I don t know if you remember that . Ouch . But are we playing that pyramid game ? Excruciating . Horrific . Would you rather have shards of glass in my eyes ? I don t know , I can bet this to you . So she asks , how would you rate your pain ? Four stars . Two enthusiastic thumbs up . She goes , how would you rate it on a scale of one to ten with ten being the worst ? You know what I m saying ? A low number isn t going to help you . Oh , I m a two . Maybe the high ones . You could give me a baby aspirin and cut it in hand . Maybe a flinstone vitamin and a bad ear . You can go ten to all the threes and fours and cents . I m saying such ridiculous numbers . I couldn t bring myself to say ten though , because I had heard the worst pain a human can endure is getting the femur bone cracked in half . I don t know if that s true , but I thought if it is they have exclusive rights to ten . And now I m thinking , what was I worried about ? Is there like a femur ward at the hospital ? They would have heard about me and hobbled into my room . Who the hell ? Have the audacity ! The city was on a level ten ! You know nothing about ten . Give me a sled chair . Let me show you what time is all about Mr . Tommy A . Oh ! Yeah ! I m gonna possibly sit down . I can t . So I thought I ll say nine . And then I thought no , childbirth . I better not try to compete with that . And then I m thinking , you know what must be hell giving childbirth when your femur bone cracked in half ? Hmm . So I said I guess I m in eight . She goes , okay , I ll be back . I m like , oh , I blew it . I ain t getting nothing with age . But she surprised me . She comes in . She goes , the doctor told me to give you morphine immediately . And I m like morphine . That s what the guy in saving private run right before he died . Okay , I m a four . I m a zero . I m a negative 11 team . </s> <s> Morphe . So they gave me morphine . Wow . All I know is about 15 minutes later , just with the hell of it , I was like , I mean , eight again . Guess who s in eight ? And they finally checked me out . I m walking on the hall going , say eight . Say eight . Say eight . Say eight . Say eight . Copy eight day . Did you get some weight ? Did you put any weight ? I throw in . You can t throw in number . Johnny Ampli Sew , did you get any eight over there ? I don t understand my own visuals . I can t throw in numbers around . I m gonna find out . I think . I don t know . So they sent me to my regular doctor for a follow up . And I was nervous going because my cholesterol . I knew it was gonna be high because last year it was high . And I hadn t done anything different . What are the actual cholesterol ? It s gonna plummet for no reason . Come on , 200 . Come on , 337 . What can that be ? I ve Burger King coupons and my product . It should explode . So I was nervous . And I realized that s the only time as an adult that I feel like a little kid . Because when I go to the doctor , you didn t do what I told you , did you ? No , I m not . What should you have done ? I should have listened when you were talking to me . What are you gonna do from now on ? Pay attention when you say things . When are you gonna start ? I m gonna start right now . I need you . Tell a doctor . He s a good doctor , I think . I told him I get heartburns sometimes . So he goes and gets me a list of things that cause heartburn . I m looking at the list and I m like , I already know this . I know how to get it . That s how you go into the hospital with a cannonball wound and they show you a list . Here s how you get cannonball wounds . I already have a cannonball wound . It s gaving . Do you have a tube of cannonball wound on me ? No . Number one , do not stand directly in front of a cannon . Not true , that is . I m not sure if I can get it . So my doctor looks at me and says , you should probably drop a couple pounds there , bro . Thank you . One of your doctor has cart blanch on insults . You just insult you for a while and then you pay him for the insults on the way out . Boy , you should lose some weight and those moles are looking pretty weird . All right , how much for that , Doc ? When can we get together again ? Think that moment walking out of your office . Thanks for the confidence boost . I m out to the Macy s day parade . Grab a rope ! What does he care ? You re big in your ugly . Next . He does care . Doctors are good people . That s why they avoid the word pain to buzz word . </s> <s> They won t hit it a lot . They don t want to scare anybody . Doctors , we ll tell you all about pressure . We ll tell you all about the pressure you re going to experience . If a doctor tells you about to feel some pressure , but to lock . At the moment , you re going to feel a little bit of pressure . I m going to go down ! The pressure ! Who like hell ? Pressure . All pain involves pressure . That s one of the definitions of pain . You could be swinging a two by four at your head . In a moment , you re going to feel a little bit of pressure . Hey , bring it on ! I m good under pressure . I like pressure situations . Oh , so my doctor , he told me to watch what I m eating . He told me to read food labels . I m going to store reading the Fignutans label . I ve always liked Fignutans . I m trying to see if it s okay to eat them . And everything looked fine . The fat content . I looked at the serving size . Two cookies . Who the hell ate two cookies ? I d Fignutans by the sleeve . Two sleeves is a serving size . I hope that I m both an eating like a treat you ve earned . Fignutans shaving is coming off the side . But I put a Newton catch and I think that bag out is a snack . The hell they talk about . Two Fignutans . With the size of a poach in stamp , you want another one ? Who I don t know . I ve already had two whole entire Fignutans . Maybe I could try to muscle one more down . But I don t think I m going to . . . I m stuck to the rack . They re nuts . We got a Near here . We got a three fake Newton eater . How many did he hurt ? What is he nuts ? Doesn t he read ? Three ! Who s coming out with serving sizes ? A serving size of ice cream is a half a cup . What is that ? Is that like a joke some guy put on there ? Hey , come here . Look what I put for the serving size . Did you see ? I just did it as a joke but they re going out like that . I don t know what to do . Just let it go . I guess there s nothing you can do now . You ever know anybody to eat a half a cup of ice cream ? Hey , you want to go grab something to eat ? Oh , no . Not a half a cup of ice cream . Yeah , a whole half a cup . I just kept eating and eating and eating . I must have had two spoonfuls . I think a serving size of ice cream is when you hear the spoon hit the bottom and it can tame you . </s> <s> You can t do this anymore . I even ripped the sock . Not sure what they re talking about today . Half a cup of ice cream . I have to lay off dairy though . That s what my doctor threw in as I was leaving his office . Oh , and I ll lay off dairy . I m like , what the hell ? I m kind of blank and sweep as I am . And no more happiness . What would you ? Does he care ? I m trying to lay off dairy . I m in the supermarket with my little cart and I m trying to avoid the dairy aisle . I can see they ll have party hats on over there . I mean the juice aisle . Sloped over with juice people . Huh . I learned something in the juice aisle and that is , I don t know what s going on with cranberries , but they re getting in all the other juices . Whoever the salesman is for cranberries does a great job . He s showing up everywhere . Hey , what do you got apples ? Put some cranberries in them . We ll call it cran apple , go 50 50 . What do you got ? Great tub of cranberry . What do you got ? Mangoes cran mango . What do you got ? Corn chips cran chops . Why don t you back off , cran man ? Why don t you take your sales chofing , have a vacation ? He s working too hard . He s making the other fruit guys feel bad , you know ? Like the banana guy wakes up . Man , I ain t into nothing . Cran man s all coupled up . You gotta get cracking banana manly . You gotta get on a stick . I doctor also told me to , you know , eat more fruit . So I had some pop tarts this morning . Nice thin layer in there . You ever look at a pop tarts box ? They have directions on it . Can there be a simpler food item than pop tarts ? Like if the directions weren t on it , would somebody , what the ? How do I get that goodness in me ? What do you do ? How do you get it done ? You read , man , that s what you do . They have two sets of directions . In case you don t understand one set , you abandon that whole track and get on something little easier for yourself . They have a set of toaster directions , which believe it or not , is more than one step . After they re possibly , be more than one step . I can only think of one . Step one , toast the pop tarts . Go ahead , toast them . Pay are you still reading this ? But they ve managed to break them in the smaller increments . These are some of the actual steps . I would love to be in the room watching somebody west who can sult these toaster steps . Okay , number one . Remove pastry from pouch . I see where they re going with this . We re banging on all cylinders . Number two , insert pastry . Insert pastry . Vertically , oh , oh , no . </s> <s> They re reading toasted direction . You re going to throw the vertical concept at them . Then they have a whole set of microwave directions . That just blew me away that you could actually microwave a pop tart . How long does it take to toast a puff tart ? A minute ? Do you want them dark ? People don t have that kind of time . Listen , if you need to zap fry your pop tarts before you head out the door , you might want to loosen up your schedule . And I swear it says , microwave on high for three seconds . I don t think I want to wake up and be eaten in three seconds . Your alarm goes off , and put them in date . Oh , it s right . If you re waking , eating , and hauling them in three seconds , you re booking yourself too tight . Pick up some Montana brochures or something . You re not living for our village . We just moved . I called UPS to ask him to help out with some boxes . Now , they re a good service , but you have to have information ready about your boxes before you even call them . I had no idea . I called them up . Yeah , I have about ten boxes to become thick of them . We need to know the weight and the girth . Okay , goodbye . So I call back . We need the weight and the girth . Okay , I don t know what the weight is . And , um , I don t know what girth means . So now what s the procedure ? So this guy talks to me like I m four years old . Will you have a bathroom scale ? Yeah , but if I put the box on a scale , it s going to cover up the numbers . I take them off really quick . Ah , zero . I m not fast enough . What s he talking about ? So then it gives me like his Mr . Wizard formula . How about a few stand on the scale and weigh yourself . Get off the scale . Pick up the box , get back on way . You and the box together and subtract your own weight . I m going slow down . Hold on , professor . I know this guy has never tried this because I tried it . And you still can t see the numbers . What am I , Mr . Olympia ? Three pounds . Then I had to hang up in the middle of his girth formula . You got them sharing me it was easy . You know the girth is very simple to figure out . You take the length and you double that by the smaller of the height after you triangulate the hypotenuse from the third side of the . . . Okay , I got to go . I m getting another call . Yeah , I m too stupid to talk to you . I m going to talk to you . I m going to talk to you . I m going to talk to you . </s> <s> I m going to talk to you . I m going to talk to you . I m going to talk to you . I m going to talk to you . Yeah , I m too stupid to talk to you . I just want to not be on with you any longer . So this is true . I figured I would call back and just make up some numbers . You know ? Let them come out and pick them up . It s wrong . I ll pay the difference . Just dispatch the truck . So I call back . I have 10 boxes and . . . No , I m another guy . Yeah , and they all weigh exactly 22 pounds . And they ll have a girth of . . . . . . three . Three , one . Three girth units . Come pick them up . Please . I m begging you . The boxes and the ground and they have tape all on them . And they ll probably fit on a dolly . Why must you torture me ? We needed a refrigerator for our new place . I ve never bought a refrigerator in my whole life . I went into the appliance store . There s a 900 of them lined up . There s a salesman there . What s this guy supposed to say about refrigerators ? Well , you have this refrigerator right here . This keeps all your food cold for 600 . You ve got this refrigerator . This keeps all your food cold for 800 . Check this out . 1400 . Keeps all your food cold . So this guy s working me on this one . I ve never seen a guy work so hard . This one is a very nice refrigerator . It has a meat drawer . And what you do with that . . . . . . you would put meat . Whatever varieties that you would choose . . . . . . these would be your meats . So there s no requirement on the types of meats you could pick . Bacon . Marbled meats . There s an endless selection . Endless . And this one also has a crisper for crispy things . Potato chips . Look in the door when the door s open . This has an egg area . And that s a very nice thing . It s an area for eggs . You put them all in the egg area . You come home and you go , Hey , where are the eggs ? Right in the egg area . And they re all written in person . And that s a real nice feature . That is a nice touch . We also had to get the phone turned on . I m at my friend s house . I call the phone company . Can you turn on our telephone ? Okay , it s going to be a problem . I figured . . . How ? Why ? That s just going to be a big nightmare . That s our policy . It s going to be a nightmare . Something about hell on earth . It s different than I thought . I didn t know how it worked . So I asked them , How does that work ? Do we have to wait in our home for a few days for the phone people to come out ? </s> <s> No , we do it differently now . We can just flip the switch from right here . Oh , great . Can you go ahead and flip it ? We re going to flip it next Thursday . We re going to flip it next Thursday . Can you flip it right now ? We re going to flip it Thursday , late , or Friday , or sometime at no pumber . Can you see it from where you re at ? Can I come down and flip it ? What do I know ? I guess there s only one flip switch and he has a lot to get to . I assume they re turning . Maybe they re big giant switch . Is it really hard to flip them ? Man , he s never going to get to my house . I m going to go down here and cheer him on . Go switch , flip or go ! Flip them , switch it ! Flip them , go ! Flip them , go ! Flip them , go ! Get him right . So how do you use a phone to book the flight ? I m here and the reservation gave me a confirmation code . I m like , I m an idiot . She gives me this . Mr . Rigg in your confirmation code . Jot this down . It s B as in boy . Oh , okay . P as in Paul . Slow down . K as in kite . Oh , I know kite . I know . I know all about kite . And cue as in quadmire . Give me another word . I want a fly so bad . I call back to confirm the flight . She wanted another confirmation code . I don t know about you , but I feel like an idiot trying to quickly come up with words for letters . And panicking on a phone . The confirmation code . It s B as in , uh , oh man . Uh , baked beans . Uh , P as in pneumonia . Uh , K as in , cut off . And cue as in , cut off . They want to do that with letters . Nobody ever does that with numbers . My code , it s a four as in , four hundred and twenty three . Two as in , two thousand nine hundred and forty one . No , forty seven . Be sure code . Sometimes you ll get a confirmation code that includes zeros and o s . You write them the same way . They re completely different keys . They ll give you the number one and the letter i . You ll , you write those the same . They re different keys . A small o looks the same . They don t care . They ll never be able to communicate this back clearly . I d like to give a code to these people for their big vacation . </s> <s> Here s your confirmation code . You re , you re going to need this for your vacation . Are you ready ? Okay , it s one , one i , one o zero , zero , oh , oh , I , one , oh , zero , one i , small l . Yes . Bought voyage . I flew here . How come the first class people just , they can just get on whenever they want . I ve always hated that . First class people board it . You re leisure . Take your time . First class people . Coach , people go , wait , sit , sit , scuzz , wait little piggies . So when you do get on , the first class people , they re already sitting there . They re all sprawled out in their big thrones . Bring me the head of a pig . And a goblet of something cool and refreshing . Anyone have a fiddle ? Make someone from coach fiddle form . A newsman . They have fiddles in the overhead ramps up there . You re not allowed to even use their bathrooms . The bathrooms up front are for our first class passengers that go to the bathroom . The coach bathrooms are located at Newark Airport . Concorsi . Concorsi ladies and gentlemen . So when you do board , the first class people , they re sitting there . A lot of them are working as you re boarding . They have computers out and calculators . They re looking up at you like , hey , we re making money right now . Right now we re making money . Go , get in the back . Close that curtain . Not a wanna say it . Even in my peripheral . Snap it . Snap it . It s a matter of those , they gotta cover us up with a tarp . You go in the back , everybody has coloring books . Hey , come here . Where was you ? Where was you at ? You re in the middle and there s nine of us and you re in the middle . And we have all the armrests so you gotta sit like this . You gotta figure out a way to eat your snack while your elbows are touching . You gotta learn how to twist your little plastic utensil . I like to sit way in the back , way in the back . Except for one thing , all the good meals run out . You know , you re poking your head out from row 199 . The flat attendance are this big . You can hear the good meals getting snagged . You have a turkey sandwich , a chicken quesadilla , and a cold fish head . And just , I wonder what I m going to do . So when they get to the back of the plane , they have to do that flight attendent psychology game . </s> <s> Pretend like the good stuff never even existed . It never even was . Would you like a nice cold fish head ? They re frozen solid . Frozen had a fish . The eyeballs in there and the skeletons coming out . It comes with a turn up and a spork . I was wishing you d have one of them left wishing upon a star . But I admire flat attendance , man . It really do . They put up with a lot of garbage from people . Have you ever been sitting in your seat and you see somebody trying to fit something in the overhead rack that you know ain t going in there like in a million years ? Have like a mattress on a lamp ? You re looking at them like , what kind of perception problems this guy had ? And the flight attendants are always nice . They always run up and act like it might maybe fit . Oh , I don t know if that s going to get up there . We can check it for you . You re more run . I know that s what they want to say . I would last about eight seconds at that job . I ll just get up there . Does that look like it s going to fit ? Look , this is my dream . You have a dead yak . Are you okay ? You don t see all these people jammed up waiting on you . You don t see any of that . Oh , this is your world . It s all about you . You let us know when you re all set , Captain U , planet . And I feel bad for the gate agents because they try to get the boarding process to run smoothly , but no one will listen to them . Don t blame them . They try . They get on the intercom . Ladies and gentlemen , we re about to begin boarding . If we could ask for your cooperation , would you all please remain seated until your row has been called ? Everyone , please , please remain seated . Everyone , please back away from the gate . Please back away from the gate . Somehow , by the time that comes out , the speakers , it must sound like everybody up and rush the door . Everyone , immediately try to squish your fat butt simultaneously in the small gate door area . Hurry , push in shove , everyone . Push in shove . Do whatever you have to to get on board . This is the last helicopter out of Vietnam . I m embarrassed to be human . We want to get on board . You re going to get on board . We want to get on board . Wow . Human beings , man , I m sure you ve been at airports with the moving sidewalks . You know the whole stand right walk left concept ? Well , for some people , unlearnable . You ain t getting it in , no matter how much stimuli you offer . </s> <s> I ve been on them where I don t understand how people don t see that that s the system . There s a big yellow dotted line going down the middle and it s stenciled every three feet on the sidewalk . Stand , stand , stand , walk , walk , walk . On the handrail , stand , stand , walk , walk , stand , walk , pictures of people standing , walking . And I ve seen footprints together in a park . And you still have people riding that left handrail . It s fun to fly . Watch them close because they re the ones at the end of the moving sidewalk . Something changed . Something changed . I m trying to get into inventing . That s all . I know what I m going to try to invent , you know , I don t know if I m being overly ambitious , but I m trying to invent an ironing board that when you open it , it doesn t sound like this . Every ironing board I ve ever opened sounds like a witch being boiled and oiled . Don t be jumping to anything ! I m trying to invent something ! You ever just look at an ironing board ? Can you imagine getting that approved in today s safety conscious world ? What did you want to get an approval on ? I call it an ironing board . I want to have like a surfboard shaped device about this high . And I want to support it with two thin , criss crossing poles . So the center of gravity is precariously high . So the slightest nudge would be sure to topple it . Then I want to put a big hot metal thing on the top of that , with water , the temperature of lava oozing out the sides , and dripping off the board for burn wounds . I want one side to be a white hot heat for scarring . I want the sheer weight to be able to cause blunt force trauma . And I want the whole thing to come to a point for puncture wounds . It seems a little unsafe for adults . I m not finished . I want a cord coming down so you get the toddlers involved . Why are we allowed to have these ? Inventions intrigued me . I was reading about the walkie talkie , and I read it was a military invention . And surprised me , because usually military stuff has strong names . You know , Apache helicopter . Tomahawk missile . Walkie talkie . How do that slip through the system ? It s a general talk , and some guy , what do you have there , soldier ? Well , it s a new communication device . It s untethered with a label that shoots to speak effectively when they re in the field . What s it called ? Walkie talkie . </s> <s> Look , I m walking , I m talking . Now you walkie talkie , general . I m walking , talking . Are you walking , talking ? I like it , soldier . What s this explosivity device ? The wire make a blam . And this is the Rudy Tudie , amen , shoot ! Walkie talkie . I m wearing new contacts . I just had my prescription changed after six years . You ever wait that long ? Then you get new lenses . You re like , man , I could have been saying things . How can instantly improve vision not be at the top of your to do list ? I ll see you tomorrow . I don t have time . I don t have time to seek clearly . No , I don t . No , I can t do that . You see what s on my desk ? So I go in for the eye exam . I don t know about you , but I concentrate like crazed your knee eye exam . You don t want to get a d on that thing . End up with these big thick coat bottle lenses . I didn t take a serious . Are you still in here ? I m just seeing shadows and shakes . It s important . They don t call it a quiz . So I go in there and sit in that big chair . He slides that big giant thing on my face . Are these my glasses ? What happened to me ? It s going to be a hell of a pair of glasses . Do I like it better like this ? Or like this ? I like this one , but I want to see that one again . That one s pretty good , but let s go back that out . Quick , quick , quick , quick , quick , quick , quick . I hate that test . Because I can t commit . I can feel my eye doctor losing his patience with me . Let s try it again , Brian . Which one do you like better ? Number one or number two ? I don t like either one of those . Yeah , but that wasn t the question I asked . I asked you which one you like better , and I was careful to phrase it that one . So why don t you keep that in mind while we try it yet again ? Which one do you like better ? Number one or number two ? Through about the same . Well , why would I waste your time and mind by making them both the same ? Did you ever stop to think about that ? You ready to try it one more time ? What do you like better than me ? Way too much pressure during that entire exam . They do one test every time . I don t know what they re looking for . All I know is I get an anxiety attack in the middle of the damp thing . Tell me the exact moment point A is directly over point B . Now ! No , now ! Now ! Then ! I don t know . I don t know what it happened . I m worried if I m off on 8th of a second , I ll get these big giant Hubble coming attraction glasses . So you must have messed up that A B test . </s> <s> Good , I ever ! Come on , don t open it . What are they helping me with ? My ability to watch cars pass on the highway they pass now ! And they pass now ! Man , how do you do it ? It s weird in the eye exam room . It s just him and me . It s dark in there . The door s closed . I feel strange when he pulls his chair up uncomfortably close to you . He s like this far from my face . He shines as goofy light in my eyes for about an eternity . How you doing here ? I m a little uncomfortable . Can you back up a time ? Are you looking at my soul ? You want a tick tick ? So he says , you know you have one eye set a little bit higher than your other eye ? No . I did not . Because it doesn t affect your vision or anything . I thought you might want to be self conscious for the rest of your life . I went out to my car mirror . Am I some kind of monster ? Is that a hump ? I am not an animal . I am a man ! It s not only them . I have no idea what you re talking about . He says it s exactly what you think you can see at three different distances depending on where you look through your lens . You can see close , medium , or far away . I can t even imagine you re going to use that . There s a book . There s a play . There s an office in Torrey . Do people need this kind of range ? Is that a fly man ? Is that a comment ? I m actually kind of quiet off stage . A lot of people don t realize that . I was at a dinner party recently . A bunch of people that I don t know . One guy talking plenty for everybody . I mean myself , right ? And then I , and then myself , and me , me . I couldn t tell this one about I , because I was only going to do it myself . Me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me . You wear the Mee Monster . So I tried to jump in with a little story . I don t want to just sit there the whole night . Right when I m done with my story , this guy goes , that ain t nothing . I didn t mean to waste everybody s time . Tellin my nothin story . Here , let Mark Go Polo speak . He s back with Tales of Adventure . A story ain t nothin . Maybe it wasn t , because I made the mistake of trying to tell a story about having only two wisdom teeth pulled . And I learned a lesson . Don t ever try to tell a two wisdom tooth story , because you ain t going nowhere . </s> <s> Before wisdom teeth people are going to parachute in and cut you off at the pass . Halt , halt with your two wisdom tooth tale . You will never complete one . Trust me . I m trying to tell my story . You know , I had some wisdom teeth pulled . I had , I had two , I had four pulled . I had four pulled . I had four pulled . No , five . No , nine . I had nine wisdom teeth pulled . All of mine were impacted . They were all coming upside down . The roots were up around my tongue coming out my nose . They were tusks . That was a warhog . No anesthesia . They pulled him out with pliers . I was eating corn in the cob that afternoon . Can the blue ribbon upon his chest ? That knocks the socks off of my wisdom tooth tale . Why do people need the top other people ? I ve never understood it and I see it all the time . Obviously people get something out of it . At best people wait for your lips to stop . You know , as soon as you . . . Okay , yeah , you made . You made . You see the difference ? You see that ? Now I do . What is it about the human condition ? People get something out of that . That s why I have a social fantasy . I wish I was one of the 12 astronauts who have been on our moon . They must love knowing they can beat anybody s story . Whenever they want . They can sit back quietly at a dinner party while some other person , some me monsters , doing his thing and let him go . Let him run with the line while you be quiet . Let him have his moment . Yeah , I m a big traveler . I have my business all . I got a month globe , and I m going to check . I m driving in the Autobahn because people flee to sports cars . I m in Zurich and I get a Swiss account that I m in the check . Mount Kilimanjarox , but as you mount up the cancel that , runways and ask when I ll have sure of the first time you go in here . You know , you have that Pacific Green Company . You re going to try to take that over and everything . I m going to go out of the project . I m not going to have a night . Everybody , everybody , go . I walked on the moon . Well , you have the floor , Moonwalker . You know , you mentioned driving on the Autobahn that reminded me . Once I was driving in the Sea of Tranquilitimus . And my lunar rover . And I too was worried about our speed . </s> <s> I don t remember the way . Where are the only ones on the moon ? You guys are great . Thank you very much . </s>"

I write shit down when I m high and I get mad at myself when I m sober . I wrote this down . A unicorn is a donkey from the future . What the fuck does that mean ? It means it needs to stop smoking so much weed stupid . Finish it off making fun of my haircut right away . I really appreciate that . Yo , I m out of tap out to baldness . At a certain point in time you can t keep kidding . Haircuts , we still look like shit . That s just . . . You got it ? What s going on ? Father time , you cruel bitch , you went again . When I was young I had a hair transplant so I have this stupid scar in the back of my head . You see that thing right there ? It s like a little smile . It s a dumb thing that I did when I was 20 or when you re young and someone convinces you that you can fix something you don t like about yourself . You can do some stupid shit and that s the dumbest one ever . A hair transplant , it s one of the most ridiculous ideas ever . You re going to take a bunch of hair from back here and never falls out and move it up here where it s fallen out . So it s like taking a bunch of really healthy people and you move them into a neighborhood where everyone s dying . The neighbors who just flying off the face of the earth , they re like , what the fuck is going on ? Hold the ground ! Where are we ? It s the machine you can t fix , you can t fix lips . You can try but you re just going to freak people to fuck out . Okay ? Period . No one has ever taken five days off work and come back or . . . Everybody s like , I like it . I like it . That s better . No , that s a sign you re fucking crazy or you made out with a beehive . Something went wrong . The fuck are you doing , you crazy bitch ? They didn t know . How could they know the first woman to try the lips ? How could they know that it wouldn t work when it works so well with tits ? See , that s where it s confusing because tits can be ridiculous . They don t look like fucking staff infections . If your tits were real , you re going to die . Alright , there s something really . . . They can stick out and stretch the skin . </s> <s> We know . We know what s happening . It s the worst magic trick ever . We know . There s an incision . There s stuff on water bags under there . Bitch , that motherfucker up . And we re like , I don t care if I can touch him . He s not moving . Who s closer towards me ? I m more happy . I m excited . We re weird about visuals , man . People mutilate their kids decks because of visuals . That s what circumcision is about . A lot of people look out of circumcise . I didn t ask to be . I m sure a lot of you are circumcised , and I m sure a lot of you circumcise your kids . But when you really stop and think about it , it s kind of fucking crazy . I only have daughters , but me and my wife got an argument about this shit . If we had a kid , and he was a boy , I would want him to be circumcised . I go , why ? She goes , because uncut dick s her disgusting . I m like , how many of you seem ? It was so confident . It wasn t like she saw two that weren t that pretty , but she was holding out hope for a cute one . It was like , no , I m fucking seen him . No ! No , no , I m just a pigshin , a river , sleepy uncut , bigs in her past . What are you saying ? I m like , that s ridiculous , the way it looks really it . No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , it looks gross . It s all this extra skin . Like , do you even know what a vagina looks like ? Are you serious here ? Have you ever been sober and squat down in front of a mirror ? And take a good assessment of what the fuck you re packing ? Let me tell you something , the extra skin might be the best looking part of that contraption . Because you get pulled out of part , you got the predators mouth . And you re really giving me a hard time for some extra dick skin . How dare you ? How dare you be so minimally committed to this past relationship ? I m with your asshole , and you re here complaining about the looks of certain dicks . How rude , how thoughtless . And look , man , if you don t lick your girl s ass all somebody has or somebody will , it s that serious . It s another level of commitment . I would never second size of my kid , but what I might do is cut it like a crown . No . Go , he s the king , man . My kid s the king . Go to the doctor , hey man , you think you d do that shit in some kind of tribal pattern or something ? </s> <s> What is that ? The fuck is wrong with us ? I already support gay marriage because I m in a regular marriage and it s gay as fuck . Some of these are jokes . My marriage is not , and I shouldn t clarify what I mean when I say that marriage is gay . I don t mean it s negative . A lot of people get mad , if you go to a movie , you come out and go , oh man , a movie was gay . Because they re saying , what have a gay person hears that and they feel terrible because you re associating something they can t change . Their sexuality was something negative . And that is not what I mean when I say that marriage is gay . What I mean is that it s like two dudes fucking each other . I was playing . See , it s not gay if you re happy . I m happy , man . I love my wife . I love having kids . I ve never been more happy in my life . But I know I m not going through a divorce right now . And that s when shit gets crazy because that s when you all of a sudden have to talk to some people . You don t even know if they decide what happens with all your money . Shit gets nuts when you realize that a lot of the legal system isn t really designed to solve problems . It s designed to make lawyers money . So they re allowed to keep arguing . They fucking keep arguing . They re not going to settle this shit . And it never gets settled . I watched a friend lose everything he earned in a three year marriage . He worked for ten years , ten , twelve hours a day and just fucked up and married over his head . Shit got crazy . He had a pay for her lawyer . You imagine when it would be like to go to war for the rest of your money and you have to pay for the enemy s generals . I watched him go fucking crazy . I watched him at red lights just going fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck . You re like what s wrong man ? Nothing , nothing . The dude was just , he was murdered suicide and we re talking him off the edge . I guarantee you if you came up to my friend Matt at his darkest moment . I said listen Matt , I can fix your life . I have a time machine . And this is what we re going to do . I m going to press this button and we re going to go back in time to the moment before you met your wife and you are going to get to live your life over again knowing the mistakes of the past . But before we do , suck my cock real quick . That s how gay marriage can get . Because I don t know how to use the respond in the same situation . But I m pretty sure my friend Matt would have knocked himself unconscious sliding into that dude s health . You would have sucked that dick like it was the horn of freedom . </s> <s> He was on a cliff with a conch shell . Calling battleships . Like he was at the bottom of the ocean breathing through a straw . Oh . Freedom . And why wouldn t you do it ? Why wouldn t you ? How long can it take ? You get a whole do over ? You wouldn t do it ? I d say you re gay if you won t do it . You don t want to do all you want to live your whole life in a downward spiral that you re never going to play yourself out of this economy . You suck his dick in time travel . What are you up to ? Get in there son . That would be my advice . I would say suck his dick in time travel . If he came to me , my other piece of advice would be make sure he really has a time machine first . Okay . The last thing you want to hear after your blog , guys , is him laughing about it . That is . . . That s hella man . You re throwing up in the sink . He s having a fun . A fucking time machine . I told you he s not a fucking time machine . Oh man , why you laughing ? Why you laughing man ? You know I ain t got no time machine . Come on man , cut this shit . Let s be honest with what s going on here . Here s what s going on . You like sucking dicks , but you don t like to take responsibility for your action . Right ? So you get tricked a lot . Hey man , don t cry . Oh , come on man , don t cry . Hey listen , listen , listen , listen , listen . Here s what s up . First of all , I m just fucking around . Okay . And I do have a time machine . There s no worries man . I got a fucked up sense of humor . But I cried , Joe s , but here s what s important . I feel bad . I didn t mean to hurt your feelings . And I m gonna make it up to you . Okay . Suck it one more time and you go fly . I did it . It sounds ridiculous , but if you put that hand in the paper somewhere , suck my dick and you could use my time machine . Most people would go get the fuck , but at least once a week . You would get a guy who calls up and goes , how s this work ? You re like , that s what you re fishing for man . You re not looking for flounder , right ? You re looking for a very specific type of fish . I did that joke in LA and the guy came up to me after the show and goes , shouldn t do that joke because time trial wasn t possible . He waited , he had to tell me . He s like , one of those fucking assholes on Twitter that wants to let you know when you re wrong . Dude , time trial wasn t possible . And I go , what does that mean for now ? </s> <s> Are you sure you know what is gonna be possible a million years from now ? That s crazy . Who saw fucking phones coming ? 300 years ago . Who saw 30 years ago looking at a phone and going , someday you re gonna watch people fuck on that ? There s a lot of shit we don t see coming , man . 200 years ago , if you wanted to picture something , you ought to draw it . Think of how stupid people were back then . No one knows what the fuck the future holds . You say it s impossible to have anything in the future silly . The guys , you don t understand science . It s called the grandfather paradox . The reason why a time machine s impossible is because if you had a time machine , you could go back in time and kill your grandfather before your father was ever conceived . Thus you could have never existed to make that time machine . And I m like , what kind of an asshole wants to kill his grandpa ? That old , and douchey shit you could do with a time machine . That s the name of a scientific principle , really . How about go back to high school and fuck everyone , paradox ? You know ? I wouldn t kill grandpa , but I ll fuck this shit out of a few confused 18 year olds . If all of a sudden I found myself back in 1985 , oh shit , I might be running things . I would go straight , pants purple , reen on those hookers , alright ? That I might do . Yeah , that s creepy , but what am I going to do ? I time traveled . I might show up on a Hitler s taking a shit and punch him right in the deck . Do you imagine if you could just pinpoint your location , or up in Hitler s bathroom , all these jewels , I hate these jewels . Ha ! Ha ! You disappear , you screaming . Guys , come in with guns . And the best part about that is you could be that over and over again . You have a time machine . Come back anytime you want . You could do it one tenth of a second earlier every time he never sees you coming . And I feel like a couple of weeks now that he starts to recognize you . There s like a hole in the space time right before you punch him . YOOH ! I might do that . You would have to be there right when the time machine is invented though . Otherwise , it would already be done . You know ? Like you would say , dude , let s go back in time and shit on Hitler s head . Fuck an awesome . By the time you think about that , when you appear in the past , you will be on a mountain of human shit twice the size of Everest . Don t fuck it , it s freezing up here ! We were so unoriginal ! The idea that if you had a time machine , you could fuck the whole world up , therefore people wouldn t use it . </s> <s> My idea is ridiculous . Because you look at the shit that we have that might fuck the world up that we already use . Like nuclear power ! You see what s going on in Japan ? That s fucking scary ! They don t know how to turn nuclear power plants off . Did you ever even guess that that was the case ? Wouldn t you have assumed there was a conversation about that back in 1970 ? Hey man , what happens if the power goes out ? Dude , don t be negative . It s not gonna go out . We re just gonna build this sun out in the field . We re pretty sure we can keep it cool . We re gonna eat through the fucking earth . What are you ? You re gonna be like a kid . You re gonna be like a kid . You re gonna be like a kid . You re gonna be like a kid . You re gonna be like a kid . You re gonna be like a kid . You re gonna be like a kid . You re gonna be like a kid . You re gonna be like a kid . You re gonna be like a kid . You re gonna be like a kid . That s like a kid spilling a gallon of milk and then cleaning it up with his underwear . It s like , what are you doing , you fuck ? You made an even bigger mess and you re naked . Get outta here . Let me handle this . Gonna put a big fence around this fucking place . People are crazy . We re a bunch of button pushing monkeys , man . I think that people are responsible for the big bang . And it s the stupidest idea I ve ever come up with . And it s not even real I m not idea because I was high on a pot brownie and an isolation tank when I came up with it . But the idea is we re fasting by technology . The biggest experiment right now is the Large Hadron Collider . You guys know what that is ? It s the biggest experiment in human history . 10 , 000 different scientists from 100 different countries and they made this 22 mile long , something fucking machine that s spinning these atoms around a hair on the speed of light . They re gonna slam them in each other and make little black holes . But what s crazy about that is those particle physicist dudes and nobody understands . One of their theories is that inside every black hole may be a whole nother universe . And that what the whole universe might be is galaxies inside every galaxy is a black hole inside that black hole , hundreds of billions of galaxies each with black holes in the center , each with hundreds of billions of galaxies and it s fractal and it will go on forever . They re making this shit and switch on . There s a bunch of fucking dudes and everybody s like , well we gotta stop getting married . </s> <s> I ll tell you right now , they know gay guys , don t they ? We live next door to me and see if he like an equal with his little wife . We are gonna make the fucking big bang . And I know it sounds ridiculous and especially coming from the fear factor guy , it loses all credibility . But if you stop and think about it man , they don t know how the universe started but the big theory is the big bang and that theory states that 14 billion years ago the whole universe was smaller than the head of a pen but something happened and exploded and created everything we see in the sky to that . I think 14 billion years ago there were some scientists and they were probably autistic and they were on anti anxiety medication and they would drink in red ball and no one touched them and they would masturbate and they never cried and they made a big bang machine and they sat around and looked at it and one guy went , I ll fucking press it . And he hit that thing in the whole sky with . . . And it s a reset button for the universe and every 14 billion years we hit it one second quicker and that s infinity . Maybe or maybe I was highest fucking , I m just making shit up . Just like those assholes that made the Mayan calendar , alright ? Maybe just enjoy your time here , don t fucking sweat the doom and gloom , yo . If you have friends that are into the Mayan calendar , man , it s shit s annoying as hell . Bro , the Mayans dude . Bro , ancient knowledge , you don t respect the Mayans . The Mayans had amazing technology . The Mayans could predict lunar eclipse as a thousand years in the future . Did you know they figured that out ? Did you know they hadn t figured out shoes ? We can learn shit from the Mayans like how much mushrooms not to do , how about that ? Building awesome society and then start playing football with human heads . They played a football game with human heads where they sacrificed the winning team . How high do you have to be to even bring it up in a meeting ? They like had their hands on it , they didn t even know the world . They were ridiculous , man . They were silly people . They re not here anymore . They never saw that coming yet . We think they figured out the fucking end of the world . Really ? Dude , the Mayans were wise , bro . You re being so uncharacteristically harsh . The Mayans knew about the bird deaths . They knew about the fish deaths . They predicted these . The mass animal extinction events . Have you seen the bird deaths ? People like , whoa , dude . There s a thousand birds dead in South Dakota . You know what my response is ? Maybe they realized they were birds in South Dakota and just flew in to each other at full speed . </s> <s> I m gonna shit life is that . If you woke up tomorrow and realized you were a bird in South Dakota , you d fly right into a fucking electrical tower . Get a shit existence as that . And how do we know that the bird deaths was a bad thing ? How do we know it wasn t just one bad ass worm that became a fucking sorcerer ? Got tired of this . Cut birds eating his whole worm family . So we put it in a hat with moons and lightning bolts on it . Fire came from his head and the birds fell out of the sky . How come it can t be a happy story ? Fuck birds . I m on team people . All right . Period . Talk to crazy shit with me . I used to love nature far more until my dog had eaten by a mountain lion . Which is I ve told the story in the podcast and a lot of people don t take it s true . It is a true story . I was living in Colorado for a short period of time and I saw a fucking mountain lion in my backyard . About as far as that gentleman with the backwards baseball cap . This is how far it was . I m sitting on my porch . So my porch is right here in the door to my house is right here . Not that far away . The mountain lion s way out there . I know there was a mountain lion there . I m just sitting in the back porch going , it s crazy to let you live out here . It s square . You can just , you know , you get a house out here . You just live in the woods . But it is . . . It wasn t a fucking dog . This is where I panicked when I saw the tail . Because it was moving in between the trees . You see like parts of it s body . You re like , what the fuck is that ? And I see this creepy ass . What the fuck in a tail ? That s how I knew was a mountain lion . Because nothing that s nice has a tail like that . Look , that s a tail of something that s thinking about fucking someone up on the sneak tip . It moves out of the woods and it popped its head between two trees . And we made eye contact . And I did not mean to do this , but my whole body dropped by two inches . And I went , oh ! Like there was no chest pocket . What bitch ? Did you fucking run my lawn ? All I was thinking of was I was sitting in the porch , I was looking at the door , I m like , I don t think I m gonna make it . I just looked at this thing and the realization that I fucked up , it was so strong . It was such like , oh , what did you do ? </s> <s> What the fuck are you doing ? The only thing that s close to that feeling is when you re talking to a girl and halfway through the conversation you realize , this is a dude . I couldn t figure out how to approach the situation . You fucking run for it , then it just instincts kick in . It starts chasing you . Or you treat it like an asshole on your start moving a little bit at a time . Like , what do you think I m stupid bitch ? I don t know what the fuck you re doing . It took off , it eventually took off . It ate my dog . That s a true story . It was a weak layer , it ate my fucking dog , it was casing my house . That was weird . But what was really weird is how the police deal with it . I called the cop up and I go , hey man , a mountain lion ate my dog . He goes , you gotta keep him inside at night . I decided right now I was moving . I was like , what the fuck are you talking about ? Did you say , I thought I heard you . Did you say you gotta kill everything that eats dogs ? That s what cops should say , right ? You don t kill them ? You don t kill these dog eating monsters ? He goes , hey , hey , hey , no , of course we don t kill them . It s against the law . We need them . You need them . They keep the deer population down . Do you know the deer are not bulletproof and they re made out of food ? So , what you re telling me ? Is that you need monsters just wandering through the woods , eating up all the extra food ? Who the fuck let you in charge ? You crazy legacy finking assholes . It s nature , man . It s like granola . They had to sign up . If you get attacked by a bear , play dead . If you get attacked by a mountain lion , fight back . Really , you got signs on how to fight monsters ? Why don t you burn these fucking trees down ? You got monsters hiding in the trees . How much do you really like looking at trees ? You need a certain amount of nature in your life . You don t want to go completely no nature . That s not good . People left up to their own devices . That s Las Vegas . That s only good for a visit . It s only good for a You re not supposed to live anywhere where they let you drink 24 hours a day . That s fucked up . And they give you free booze when you re gambling . Oh , fuck you ! That s crazy . How is that the law ? And it s all rainbow plus something . So , you got a fucking chemical batter going on . </s> <s> You re consciousness . You re not dead up . The other half is fucked up . So , it s just seesaw battle , retardation . When you re on red bull and whatever , and it s like nine o clock in the morning , you don t even know who the fuck you are . You got one cylinder that s just moving your feet in certain directions , making up decisions , and what are you going to eat ? It s just the spirit rhinos trip club at 9 . 30am on a Thursday . Yeah . And it was packed . That s what was really depressing . That s one of those dumb red bull and vodka moments . We were too stupid to be making your own decisions . We were eating breakfast . We were down to two word sentences . We were just like , waffles bitch . You know , you get this . You know , you get this . You get this . And nobody says anything for a minute . Somebody goes , word . And all I m thinking of is sleep , man . And all I m thinking is , oh , I can t wait to hit that pill . It s going to be so nice to go to sleep . And I hear , hey , man . You guys want to go to the rhino ? And I m like , fuck . That s my voice . So I look at that and see if they heard it too . And they re like , it s open . It is open . It would be open right now . All men need is one dude in the group that s more fucked up than everybody else . And then they feel normal . You know , you could be the craziest hormon of all time . Like , well , I m not like Jimmy . Jimmy s a fucking animal . He doesn t got one dude . Let s go to the game . Let s go to the game . Let s get coke and hookers . And then his silence and someone goes , are you serious ? Who s serious ? Are you serious ? And then you always have to have a conversation with the wife . Why are you even hanging around with him ? He s so beneath . I m loyal . He s a good buddy . I don t agree with the way he thinks about women . No , man . We got there and it was packed . There was nowhere to sit . It was like the opening scene from Blade . And I was on so many different things . I smoked some pot . I ate some pot . I drank a lot of whiskey . There was a lot of things going on . And I was sitting there . You know those moments you have when you re pissing . When you go to the , when you reevaluate your life when you re hammered . </s> <s> Ladies , I m sure you have those too , but it s a different thing . For dudes , it s like this blank moment , almost like an isolation tank . Where your force just stared a white surface . And you re pissing and you re like , I probably should just get the fuck out of here , right ? Kind of a joke is that . Fucking ridiculous , man . I m preparing for the apocalypse . I thought the apocalypse wasn t going to happen as soon as Rick s in . Torm dropped out of the race . I m like , wow . I don t know if Rick s in . Torm s ever had gay sex , but I m pretty sure it s on his bucket list . I m not bad . I m out there . You weak , chin bitch . You want to be the came , how dare you ? And this is how you can tell that a man cannot be in charge when he concerns himself with trivial matters . Like gay marriage . There s only two reasons that you hate gay marriage . It s one , your dumb or two , you re secretly worried that dicks are delicious . You can see it in his face with small jaw , he s just fighting the gay . Him and Sarah Paling could have got 100 of the retarded market . That was a dangerous time for us . That s why I think the minds are wrong . There s a lot of people that hate Sarah Paling , but I do not . I don t find anything wrong with her . There s nothing that she does that I probably wouldn t do . I don t think the same things that she does , but she s not qualified to be vice president . It nears her mind . But if they ask me , I d probably fucking do it . I d be like , how much does Joe Biden work ? Does that guy even get up before noon ? Would the country be exactly the same if Joe Biden did it exist ? I say yes , I say to wouldn t be a fucking thing , Jay . I could do his job with three extra emails a day . I really don t find , I get like 500 , 000 extra Twitter followers , man . That s no joke . That s his vibe . She didn t do it . Sarah Paling s living in the fucking frozen North . She s not even in America . She s living up in some places that are not attached . And everything that s not attached is just some shit we stole . That she is the queen of a frozen Puerto Rico . That s what the fuck is going on . That s what you want to be a millionaire . She s like , well , and I d rather just dodge moves on the way home every fucking day . I d rather freeze to death walking to get my mail . What do you expect , man ? What do you want her to do ? My friend s like , she s fucking dumb . She never reads . I m like , what do you ? You re going to be honest ? Oh , my best friends don t read . How about that ? She s talking so much shit she s known to talk about . </s> <s> You bitch , how about that ? I put Google out on your ass all the time , son . Bro , I didn t even see the fucking flush . She s not even hot . Um , she s not maybe Atlanta hot , but I ll tell you what she is . She s in bad news . Iowa holiday in hotel bar 1am . Three seconds close hot as fuck . How about that ? They know this mutant man was a reason people are cheering . That s a goddamn truth . That s some goddamn truth . She lean over the tip fingernails and cigarette and whiskey breath and said , let s get the fuck out of here . You re like , let s get the fuck out of here , baby . Woo ! But she can t be fucking present and slow down . Slow down , son . Just because you want a fucker doesn t mean she can be the queen . Settle . There s a lot of bitch men out there that think life is a Kevin Costume movie and they re waiting line to buy a book from her . She s doing something , you re waiting line to get a book signed by a chick who doesn t read books . Come here son . Have you ever done squats ? You know about beep squats ? You know about dead lifts ? You know about bison meat ? It s really healthy for you . Sarah Palin , I just think is the only hope for the conservative movement in this country . They have like a plan speech to meet her . Mrs . Palin , I just want to say that you make me proud to be an American . And I think you re probably the only hope for the right in this country . And I just want to shake your hand . And as soon as they touch hands , if you re not to this path , they tackle them in tasum . First of all , she s wearing glasses and that s a goddamn dirty trick and every man knows this . It s a goddamn dirty trick . We might not know this because you don t know how fucked up we really are . And this is nothing we re proud of , but I m going to be honest and everyone will back me up . When a man meets a woman and she s wearing glasses , the very first thing that pops into his head is , I wonder what it would look like if I came on those glasses . We re not proud . It s not something we dwell on , but it fucking pops in there , man . You just get it down . Stop it all that . You know , the proportion of me and you too , Mrs . Palin . You know , but you don t want to dwell on it . It s not fair , man . She can get fucking contacts . She knows what she s doing . She s Senator Sago . What s up with there ? Plus , she lives in Alaska . Man , I think if you live in Alaska , you probably have to have glasses on just for protection . There s probably only like 10 chicks up there . Dude , you re jumping out of boots and fucking shit . I can t get off of people s faces . </s> <s> Big Yo Semony Sam must dashes . He s waiting for women behind bushes . It s probably got 2020 vision . That s probably a protection issue . Holy little Sarah Palin . I really do think she s a nice lady . And this is why I say this . They wrote a tell all book on her . We re a dude filed her hat . They went to her town . He lived next door to her for a year . And wrote a tell all book . And the worst dirt he could dig out was that she might have had an affair with a jet ski salesman . And I m like , do you have any idea how persuasive you would have to be ? To be a jet ski salesman in Alaska ? I mean , are you really blaming her for that ? That guy might be able to fuck everyone in this room before we even do what happened . That guy might be a fucking hypnotist . He s selling watercraft in a place where everything s frozen . I m really , I m really discounting his pimp game . He s out there hunting , moose and shed . What s he gonna do ? Maybe you need a jet ski ? I like working for the UFC , but I don t like being around that many men who can rape me . It s a part of the problem . It s a weird sit that gets set around . I was hanging out with Dan Henderson once and we went to a comedy club . And the guy was heckling at the comedy club . And I go , if you don t shut the fuck up , I m gonna have Dan Harrison fuck you girl from while he holds you down . And I look over at Dan and Dan without missing a beat goes , I m gonna hold him down when I could just stare him down . Josh Barney had that might have been the creepiest shit anybody ever said in front of me in my life . I was like , do you have any no feelings for this guy s dreams ? I got a nightmare , is that motherfucker s gonna have for the rest of his life ? This is certain realities man . We are talking to a guy like Brock Lesnar and he s standing over you . There s at least one percent of your brain is going , please don t fuck me . It s not that he s gay because he s not . It s not that even if he was gay , he couldn t do better than me . He could do way better than me . And it s that Brock Lesnar wanted to fuck you . It d be his call . What are you gonna do ? Fight it off for a certain amount of time ? You get that guy s size of Brock Lesnar , he might be able to fuck you on this stage . You want to just drag you up here ? </s> <s> I have to look . Fuck swash ! And there might be two thousand of us here waiting for somebody else to say something for us . You don t want to hear there might be a juice out of the bottle s Josh ? And he might want to watch his plan . Fuck this up , go down . You don t want to be that first dude . Hey man , what are you doing s morally wrong ? What ? Fuck swash you ! Got it . Fuck Stan Pied . I m not really worried that Brock Lesnar would fuck me , but I m really worried that he would use me as a condom to fuck some way bigger . That s the real fear . I d wind up in the back of his pickup truck with a pair of bolt cutters going , why are we at the zoo ? SHUT UP ! Brock make decisions ! If ten thousand years now they found Brock Lesnar s body and his right next to David s spade s body , they d be like these are two totally different species is . I think what s going on here is this one would just carry that one around and fuck it whenever he wanted . Like a human flashlight man . Yeah , yeah . I got an argument with my wife about the flashlight man . When the flashlight became a sponsor for my podcast , it was one of the rare moments when me and Mrs . Rogan disagreed with something . She was really serious with me , she s like I think the flashlight is a terrible sponsor and it s bad for your reputation . Like wow , you even fucking know me ? How crazy are you ? Like really , really ? I m in like five documentaries on illegal drugs . I used to make people eat animal dicks on TV . And your thing in the . . . Man , this fake vagina is going to give people the wrong impression . Women don t like it man , women don t like it . There s something creepy about when you buy something and then you fuck it . There s something creepy . I love you too , but this . . . If your man came home or if you came home rather than your man was banging a flashlight , no one would be happy about that . It s weird . It s weird . There s a certain social weirdness to it . And what that comes from is that sex is supposed to be something that people give you when they like you . You get used to them , they get friendly , they want to give you affection , give each other affection . That s what it s there for . It s sort of like an incentive to be nice to people . You re like nah , no time for that . </s> <s> How about for everyone ? It s something weird about fucking something instead of a person . Even masturbation . See , the problem masturbation really is the fleshless far superior masturbation . Because when you masturbate you could feel your hand . So while you re masturbating , at least 50 of your brain is going , dude , you got to dick in your hand . And then 25 of your brain is like we got it , it s our dick , it s cool . And then the remaining 25 is going , That is the pie chart of the male mind during masturbation . And . . . Thank you . And when you masturbate there s no room for other thoughts . You can t like , take some support scores in there . I owe some money now , man . It s like , and that s it . Or you don t beat off . You know , the dog shits in the living room , you stop . What the fuck ? Can t just keep going . Fleshless like changes everything . It does not feel like masturbation . It feels like real sex . It feels great until you orgasm . And then that great feeling is replaced with a deep sadness . You realize who you are . This is you . This is you at your best . This moment right now you ve lived your whole life . You ve learned all your lessons . And here you are . Still fucking out . Here you are . You didn t know your pants on if you fucking slumped . You see ? I don t care who you are . You give me the biggest winner of all time . You can be Michael Jordan . As you re not into a flesh , you re like , oh , Michael Jordan s disappointed in Michael Jordan . Fuck this wall with me . Well , I never learned . The real dark moment comes when you have to clean that fucking thing . Is that the only time you can t pretend you do anything else ? What are you fucking ? You can pretend there s real sex . But when you re cleaning everything , you ve got to unscrew the bottom and release the crack and obscene . You just slide out of the tube like a slug that got bit hit with a mallet . And your lows look so unimpressive when they re in a sink . Look , how does that make a person that lazy little sack up nothing ? You know , sad . I feel bad about my lows . When I was a single man with no children , I looked at my sperm as a completely different thing . Like a lot of you young single with no children , people do . You look at your lows as like your Zorro mark . Right ? You re happy when you get a good volume . Right ? And you get a lot . You re like , I m excited about this . Look at it all . But once you have kids and you re looking at your lows , those could have been some awesome kids . Instead , they died at the end of a fake vagina . And they died on top of some other sperm that was there from earlier in the day that hadn t bothered cleaning it up yet . </s> <s> Something the last one is what a shock is I get tossed at the bottom of a pirate ship and it was stagas , calitants . It s fucking creepy , man . It s creepy . Mrs . Rogan particularly didn t like the fleshlight because when it became a sponsor for the podcast , it was right after she had given birth to our second child . Now , Doc is telling you that when a woman gives birth , she s not allowed to have sex for six weeks . I say eight because I know how I fuck . What s wrong ? Imagine telling that to Dr . Bitch in a hot song . Six weeks dude , her teen looks like Nick Niaz s eyebrows . Can t we a little extra time ? Even know what the fuck you re proposing ? Do you know how I d bring the thunder ? I carry all my weight in my hips and ass , bro . Taints go , dudes . Taints are not designed to really absorb punishment . It designed to be the airbags of the vagina . Give out in case of emergency . Look man , you don t think about it because you re a man . Especially men who don t have children . You look at a baby , you look at a vagina , and you go , those are two totally different sizes . Who gives a fuck ? I don t have to worry about that . But you do have to worry about that when you have your own kids . And it comes out of your wives vagina . And then you re like , whoa , I never even thought about this . This is crazy ! And luckily Mrs . Rogan went with the epidural . Which is the way to go ladies . What the fuck is this crazy trend to go old fashion ? When it comes to making babies . Like , no , we re gonna use a midwife . And we re gonna have it in my bathtub . Ooh ! Why don t you ship that baby on the bottom of a tepee , polka hontas ? Go rinse it off in river water and hide the placenta from the wolves ! You have modern technology that makes you feel nothing , my pussy explodes ! Do you know that a bathtub used to be modern technology ? Yeah ! That was back when they adjusted it only to river . Crazy fuck . Mrs . Rogan went with all the good stuff . She didn t know what was going on . It was really crazy . Instead of moving her legs around , it s all like flippity , floppy and shit . And she had a little tent in between her and the baby area . And so Dr . Spuyshri . It was like virtually no pain , it s amazing ! And the tent is going , man . The head s coming out , I got a big head , my kid s up big head , and it s just that s the way it is . </s> <s> And the tent goes like a squirrel tied between trucks . And I don t say anything , and I see he sees it . I don t want to be the guy that s going , what the fuck is this ? You know what I m saying ? You got to assume this dude knows that he s killed , he s given birth to hundreds of babies . That s his thing , man . You know , I just assume . So he gives me , he s in the baby , he s like , cut the cord . I go to cut the cord instead of cutting it like this . You know a little sideways thing that happens sometimes , you go to cut something , right ? What a shit way to start a life . Start a life of a dorky fucking , cut the cord . I give my wife the baby , my wife s crying , the baby s crying . I m crying , she s a kid little girl , welcome to the world . And all I m thinking , the first moments of my daughter s life is , how is he going to fix that ? Boom ! And I m thinking , how long do I have to look before I check ? You can t just like take the kid , what the fuck s going on down here ? The baby looks like a muck is in , that s what it looks like . You dude had a Marlon hook and some shoelaces . He s tightness thingin up and I m lost and it s goin down . My wife does never clue , there s the tent , she s got the baby , she s like a kid little girl . Welcome to the world in a body we go like , yeah . And I m like , this might be the craziest intersection on our earth right here . I m watching two completely different worlds play out right next to each other . And they re on my wife s body . On this side we have love and happiness , the first day of our daughter . And right next door is a fucking hell ranger movie . This just hooks me and hooks me . And he gets to a particularly gristly section of the vagina and as his force in the hook he goes like this . What the fuck is that ? I lost it , I m like listen man , I don t have a whole lot of rules in this life . You gotta keep your tongue in your mouth place , just enough my wife s pussy . You know what I m saying ? There s like one dude , it was like really good , it s this nut pussy , but he was kinda crazy . Like oh shit , look what the fuck I m doing . I mean I think you just spit on my wife s vagina . Oh motherfucker , you insecure . I see my wife doesn t like any of this , if you wanna know . Man you have babies and so I m gonna freak you the fuck out . </s> <s> Freaks you the fuck out when you like someone more than you like yourself . That sounds like some shitty lyrics or nickelbacks song . But I really do love my kid more than I like me and I can prove it . The other day in my house there was two bananas , right ? One of them was yellow and delicious , but the other one was brown and fucked up . And I wanted a banana , but my daughter loves bananas . And she asks for them , she s like daddy can you get me a banana ? Like give them to her and when she eats them she goes , I didn t even think about it , I just started eating this shitty banana . And while me this fucked up brown mashed potato textured banana , I m like this is the only person in a world that would make this choice for them . Cause I love my wife . But if it was just me and my wife I d be like ooh I guess that bitch is getting a shitty banana . Not only that I would leave the peed on and rub my balls in the counter . You know it gives the lights on this motherfucker ! So we re a thing man , so we re a thing we try to grow up . You ever try that shit ? It s creepy . I m trying to see how fast . Now this is not a text , it s a recording , I m recording the whole show . Well I m filming this but I m also recording it myself cause I m a fucking weirdo . And I have to listen to it in my hotel room . This is the least nervous I ve ever been for a comedy special . It s like regular show . It s weird . It ll be a little cut , it ll be a drama done a special . That s fucking freak out . Oh get it right , get it right . You guys are so cool , I swear to God I came right on , it was easy . You need to settle down for 20 boy , you re drinking alcohol that is not the 420 medicine . I m no perfect person , we re all weak inside . Here s something they can make you happier . If you go to an ATM machine , you know a lot of people acquired the ATM machine just like at a bathroom . This is what I do and this is what you can do too but you have to do it all the time . If you re going to commit to this it must be 100 of the time . And as soon as the money comes out you go , dollar dollar bill , God ! It s especially fun if you don t know if the money s coming . And it s like 60 did I get crazy ? 60 give me 60 , dollar dollar bill , God ! I did it , I did it recently at an ATM and there s a dude behind it , go motherfucker you really do do that . Can t do anything with that . </s> <s> Do it man , it makes it more fun . Otherwise it s just weird , everybody s quiet and thinking someone s gonna rob you . And plus it s one of those things where a song got stuck in my head and I had to utilize it . I have a tear of the brain for shit that I don t like and stuck in . Like if you play me a shitty fucking song there was a band called Imperial Stars that got arrested in Los Angeles because they caused a traffic jam . They blocked off the highway with their tour bus and did a music video about traffic . Traffic in and right . It s the worst fucking song ever and I couldn t stop singing it . It was like a Cohen Brothers movie . He got stuck in my head like a goddamn computer virus . This is the worst lyrics of all time you ready ? I m a rock star living on the edge . I m no for hanging out in a party here with my friends . Like someone wrote that down and went , don t next lyrics . That shit is good as it gets . I couldn t stop singing it . I couldn t stop singing it . I was singing it while I was eating . If you were talking and I didn t like what you were saying , it just started playing . And this is where it got terrible . This is why I knew I had a real problem . I was having sex with Mrs . Rogan . And in the middle of it I was mowing the lyrics . We were doing it in a doggy style position . And I m like , I m a rock star living on the edge . And then I realized how pathetic that was . And then I got disappointed . And then I lost concentration . And then I started going soft . And then I tried to bring it back . And then I faked an injury . Ah ! Oh , fuck ! Oh , oh , oh ! And you got to do a violent fake injury . You can t like , now ! You can t fuck through that kind of pain . You got to have like some serious , meniscus bucket handle tear shit going on . And you got to lie , man . It s a time in your marriage when you love someone you got to lie to them . For their own good as well as your , yes , for your ego . But for her self esteem . The certain shit women don t want to hear . Dang , I love you too . I love you too . But you know , if you re , if you go limp , funny , wife , it s like , what happened ? Just thinking about this band . I m a rock star ! You move it . I want you to listen to this . No more fuck . How s that ? You bring me back up . I m a rock star . I caught myself singing Haydair Delilah once in an elevator . And I didn t even realize I was singing it . </s> <s> And I noticed that my legs were rubbing together like a cricket . That was alone . I was vulnerable . I was like , ah ! What you do to me ? What s happening ? It s like a bit attack like a ghost . What s going on here ? Where is this going from ? Haydair Delilah once in an elevator . I m a rock star . Don t you want to answer that question ? I bet it s awesome because you re not there . You fucking rhyming stalker weirdo . How about you let her go , dude ? Where s that guy s dad ? And where was he when that boy wanted to play catch ? Huh ? Where was he ? What you do to me ? What , make you write shitty rhymes ? Is that what I do to you ? Is that my legacy ? And I m not saying that I don t like that song because I do . That s what I don t like about it . What I don t like about it is I like it . They got me , those motherfuckers . If I m in my car and no one s in there with me , I ll turn that shit up . I ll sing along . What you , what I don t like is that they got me . I think the guys kind of fucking depressed . I don t like getting sucked in anybody s depressed thoughts . I don t mind if what you think it about some kind of stupid shit . Because I like a lot of stupid shit . I don t think there s any one correct way to live this life . I have a feeling that this life that you and I are experiencing might just be one frame in some infinite movie that goes on forever and makes no sense to any of us . And I think that the one thing that we can really choose to do we can choose to have more fun . We can choose to party more . We can choose to laugh more . We can choose to take shit less seriously . Be a cooler person . 10 more . Cut the cons out of your life . And I be self advanced fucking time . What ? What ? What ? Which is why I like listening to Lutopris . I ve never seen a picture of Lutopris crying . Every time I see Lutopris , he s in a car and food polls . His girls in their underwear . There s a picnic going on . He s having a great fucking time . Here s one of my favorite all time lyrics . It s from the song Saturday Night . How are you going to act like my rims ain t clean ? Do you not see the beauty and the poetry of those words ? That s what he s really thinking about . He s not worried about the economy . He doesn t understand the economy . Turns out no one does . </s> <s> But you know what he knows ? He knows he s got enough money to keep his real shiny as fuck . So he gets right in front of him and goes , Oh , oh ! And he s happy because you can t say shit ! Donny ! Oh , no ! Oh , what you do to me ? What you do to me ? Or I got a big wee stash , pocket full of cash just seeing a big ol ass . Oh , boy ! Who s party ? What are you going to ? This one day left on earth ! This asteroid coming ! Who s party ? Are you going to ? Well , we went to the white guy s party , but he was crying and texting . That s all he did . He got a load of his disparty . He s naked on the roof throwing buckets of ecstasy into the crowd . The asteroids come and they re trying to hug it . Oh , man , I love you as to what , for all of you . Got a big wee stash , pocket full of cash . Oh , what you do to me ? Hey , man , it s the end of the world ! We re in Craig s house , and we re all reading poetry and crying . I would love if you could come over here . Yeah , I would , but I m in Lodocris s house , and it s made out of diamonds ! Oh , oh ! Got a big wee stash , pocket full of cash . I became a vegan once I realized that if you don t kill animals , they live forever and become magic . And I got this tattoo . It s an ancient Sanskrit . And what it means is , it s a symbol for universal oneness . And that s what I believe , man . I believe that we are all connected , but that insecurity keeps us from recognizing that , but that love , unconditional love , is that brings it all together . So I got this tattoo . Cut to Lodocris , this tattoo says , bitches , be sucking my dick you ! Woohoo ! How you gonna act like a double clown ? Oh , what you do to me ? I m a lunge . I might be gayer to sing that song that is the jerk off a lookin a man in the eyes . I d say it s a toss up , because at least if you jerk off lookin on a guy , you could do a crazy one bitch . You think I m scared to come on , look ? You re a tiny , gotten scared , especially if you go knuckles up . That s an aggressive posture . You re sending a message like , I don t even wanna be cuffed a ball ! Thank you Ed Lam ! Thank you very much ! I love you by the fuckers ! Thank you very much ! You re coming out to my community special ! </s> <s> Thank you very much ! I love you all ! I love you all ! </s>"

Let me say something , when y all had sex , because you got a role play , it s fun . You know what I m saying ? Like black women don t get me wrong . I love y all , but search shit , can t do it , y all . You all have too many rules and regulations . You re shit , nigga , don t touch my hand , don t touch my motherfucking hand . I just got my shit dead , nigga fuck you dog , you gotta keep his hands behind his back . You should feel the urge to grab your shit , it might come off like , oh shit . You gotta have a chin strap on , you gotta keep a lock down , man . You gotta have fun with that , man . I know it s a pretty Asian girl sitting in the crowd . How you doing , sweetheart ? You all right ? Yes , baby , bitch , I m looking at you , yes , just saying , yes , you , my , how you doing , sweetheart ? I love Asian women , see , I can have fun with you .

And I m like , I m an American soldier here to slay some , what s your nationality , baby ? What s your nationality ? You feel a pain , don t fuck it , it work better for the joke if you re via the mace . So you re via the mace . Like I m an American soldier here to slay some via the mace as .

Don t get embarrassed , it s real shit , man . And I don t want none of the white people to get uncomfortable because I do like to talk about the race issue . Because a lot of y all try to act like that shit ain t relevant no more . Like is race still relevant in America ? Look at someone with white people , whatever do you mean ? Racism always be relevant in America , two reasons . One , she s too much bad history and you can t erase that much bad history . And two , I just think it s natural for everybody to be a little bit racist . </s> <s> I don t get fuck what color you are , what your gender is , how old you are . We are all a little bit racist . And white people , y all in the first ones to announce your shit . I m not racist . I m incapable of being racist . My best friend is black . He s also my chauffeur , but he s my best friend . Everybody in this room , everybody in this country is a little racist . You might not be smack a taco out of Mexican hand racists , but we are all . . . Fuck y all , that is the way you re funny or didn t that . On the way , you re scared to laugh , y all , like 300 Mexicans going pop out of nowhere , like , what the fuck , fuck ? I make a special sour cream for you , is it ? It s fucking hilarious . And I live in LA . I love the Mexicans I do . Because of Mexicans , my lawn looks fabulous . I got a little bit of money , I live in a white neighborhood . They be out there cutting my grass and shit , it d be hot as a motherfucker outside . I ll be standing in from the house through the blanch . Like , eh , eh , eh . 20 minutes later , they re not gonna door and ask if shit . Senior , it s hot outside . They all sound like speeding up . It s hot outside . Me and my compatriots was wondering , can we have some Iowa ? I m like , nope , but I can give you some advice . How many away through it , motherfucker , that s how we got back . Bam ! Fuck that , you got to earn your turn . You can t just hop over a fence and expect the same rights . You got to earn your turn . Look at someone , a white people . Oh my god , he said it . Thank you . I ve been feeling this black man . Thank you . And I know that s a big deal in this country . Legal immigration . White people , you guys get bent out of shape over that shit . I hear you complain . Fucking Mexicans , they re coming here taking their jobs . Some of them have criminal records . We re not safe . We don t know who s among us . We ll let me remind all the white people why you re steady being man at the Mexicans . Technically , you guys were the first illegal immigrants . Because when you came to this country , it belonged to the Indians , and we know how that shit turned out . Look how quiet they got . Did you feel the tension all of a sudden ? They re like , Nigger , I can t believe you would say that . We were just starting to like you . How could you betray our trust ? Listen , I don t give a fuck if you come to this country legally or illegally . Because at the end of the day , we re all foreigners to some extent . </s> <s> My only issue is if you re going to come to this country , I got one rule . Learn how to speak fucking English . Please . You ve got to learn the fucking language . Because there is nothing more frustrating than me being a papaya s chicken . Arguing with Jorge , about what the fuck I ordered . And I m trying to catch the second half of the game . I got to happen to shit . You ever talked to somebody that don t know how to speak English ? They always got to look in a sound coming out of their face . Like they in the middle are taking the shit . It s hilarious . Like , excuse me , you know what time it is ? I don t speak in the blood . I don t . . . I was if papaya s chicken around the playoffs for basketball . And I m arguing with this motherfucker about my order . He didn t understand me . I didn t understand him . Ships terrible . I was like , dog , let me get a two piece chicken dinner . He tried to repeat the shit back to me . You want a two piece yikki ? You want a spicy or demayo ? I said , what ? He said , a spicy or demayo ? I said , what nigga , you know , put mayonnaise on chicken . Why would I put mayonnaise on chicken ? I m a hot sauce nigga . My daddy was a hot sauce nigga . He said , no demayo for the flavor . I said , what the fuck is flavor ? He kept looking at the menu like it was family feud and the answer was gonna pop up on the board . I gonna tell you to do me chicken with these baisier demayo . So , do you better get it for you ? He said , let me get a two piece chicken spicy . He said , you want a bissy ? I said , yes , motherfucker , I m busy . I don t have time for this shit . I m trying to catch the game . Kobe s on , nigga , come on . He said , no , a bissy , I said , what the fuck is he bissy ? She put it in body and the cream cheese . I said , a biscuit . He said , cc is gonna tell you what the doopie chicken is . He just bice you demayo . They gonna come with a bissy . So , you better get it for you . I m gonna eat by you . He said , let me get a two piece chicken spicy with a biscuit . He said , now you have to pickle your sides . I said , I m not playing with my penis and papas . I m not doing that . Why would I pull my dick out and jack off near the crunchy ? </s> <s> I m not doing it . He said , no , you get two side order . I said , what kind of side you got ? He said , we have a de . . . We have a de . . . That was we have a . . . But we have a de . . . We have a de yacaroni and yeast . We have a de yash bodeino . I said , fuck it . Let me go with the yash bodeino . She wants something to drink . I said , what do you have to drink ? We have a de . . . We have a de sodas and the uses . I said , I don t want no soda , but I m curious about your uses . The fuck is use ? We have a de apple use , hot and use , grapefruit juice . Listen , the point is we have to demand more from our legals . We have to demand more . It s unacceptable . Funny thing is , you don t even realize how racist America is until after you leave . I got to show not too long ago in Edmonton , Canada . There is no racist vibe in Edmonton . Well , first of all , you know , Niggas out there saying , nobody be mad at it . But I must have walked around Edmonton for four days , looking for a black person . Finally , I saw one . I didn t even know the motherfucker . I just ran up to him and hugged him . Like , nigga , where you been ? We need to stick together . He was offended . He was like , dude , get your hands off of me , bro . It s like totally absurd . I was like , shit , they got him . It was too late . I couldn t save him . I had white kids looking at me like I was an exotic animal . They was like , mom , look at him . He s so chocolatey . I want one . I think I m trying to pour milk on me . I was like , getting all changed colors . The fuck off me . And I see some of the white people , y all getting uncomfortable . Don t get uncomfortable . I love white people , man . Y all my people too . It s just certain shit I can t do with you . Like , go drinking . Every time I do a show in front of white people , after the show , you always want to hang out and buy me a drink . I can t drink with you . It s not that I don t want to . It s just I can t hang . You motherfuckers are the undisputed champs of drinking . Y all drink till y all fall to fuck out . </s> <s> And I know when y all get good and drunk because that s that noise you ll make . Woo ! Don t do that . That s scared black folks . There s a lot of bad history behind that noise . Black people , we hear , woo ! We start looking out for pickup trucks . What the fuck they at ? See , this one , like , fucking winner . He played too much . I m serious . A party ain t a party to y all to the fucking cop show up . And black people , y all know we see the police party over . White people , y all have a lot of black people . White people , y all have a freedom . We just don t have . Y all see the police , y all get braver . Dude , what your fucking badge number in your name ? No , no fucking touch me . What if I fucking touch you ? No , you shut the fuck up and move along . Eris , why are you crying ? Relax . Do you know who my dad is ? I ll sue . I swear to God . Get the fuck on . Black people , we be in the back doing sign language . Mmm , I go , mmm . And say any black people that hang out with white people in a group , make sure y all go out drinking in a group . Go with them when they order drinks . Because y all like to annoy somebody to designate a drink orderer . Anytime I hang out with my white friends , when they get it from the table and go to the bar to get around , how follow right behind us . Because y all like to go order drinks and then bring it back to us . Like it s the top C . I . A . secret . As soon as you hand me the drink , I go , man , what the fuck is in this ? Dude . Don t worry , don t ask . Just fucking chug it . 20 minutes later , I m butting naked with a cowboy hat on . Woo ! A fucking love you , Brad . Hey , just for fun , let s go hang some niggas . Mmm . Just keep it safe . So are we still excited about Barack Obama ? See , every black person in here should be clapping . Because we got to ride that nigga to the wheels , fall off . You know , if that shit don t work , the minute we go to work , white folks is looking at us like , hmm , you picked him . I can t wait till he runs for his second term , man . Because that was the most exciting part about the political process to me was the campaign . Because you knew at some point he was supposed to win . </s> <s> He had all the right ingredients that came together at the right time . It s tall , good looking , articulate , highly intelligent . You know , smooth under pressure , charismatic . And most importantly , he was the right shade . He made white people feel comfortable . Because y all know if that nigga was Bernie Mac Black ? Or precious purple , he wouldn t have won . He s like coffee with cream , he goes down easy . You ever have coffee black ? It s too strong . You re like , oof . America is not ready for ood , they re not ready yet . And he had 97 of the black vote , 97 , which means he had black people on lock . We were like a hand on the glove , we were tied together . But he still couldn t become president without white people . So for the white people that voted for him , I thank you because you helped make history . But some of y all are starting to get a little impatient . And your racism is seeping out a little bit . You say shit when you re frustrated . I thought you niggas were fast , put the takings so long . Took eight years to fuck this country up . It s going to take a second to get it together , relax . You got a lot of tough shit you got to deal with , man . Like the big controversy right now , they talk about that mosque near September 11th . A lot of people upset about that . You know , September 11th just rolled around . Every year we got to relive that bullshit . But there was a bright side , man . You know , September 11th blacks and whites came together like never before . Because after September 11th , Arabs took all the pressure off us . I m telling you , they had a new niggas , this amazing . I get on a plane now , white people , y all be happy to see us . Dude bro , come here . Here s to next to me , man , right here . Here , hold my daughter . I love you , nigger , come here . We got to watch out for those fuckers for shizzle , Missile . We ve bonded now , that s good . And I realized certain aspects that shit just affected people differently . Like when the anthrax thing happened , white people , y all was very nervous . Y all will come up to me and work and warn me . Like , oh my god . That s how white people get when they get dramatic . Oh my god . Aries , be careful , don t open your mail . I m gonna say some black people who s never worried about anthrax . Because y all know how to turn this hand , we don t open our mail , no way . We think that shit is a bill , we might hold it to the light like , nah , that s the red notes . </s> <s> Fuck that . You wanna get us with anthrax ? Put that shit in the JZCD , that s how you get up . I got that new jigger . Fuck shit . Oh , something got me , motherfucker . Track 12 , nigga , be careful , track 12 . Stone away . And I m originally from here , but I live in LA . And I was in LA when that whole thing went down . It was crazy , because my people from back , he s called me . I said , man , turn on TV , playing was taken over , hostage situation . And I ve seen the movies . So when I heard hostage situation , I m thinking big ass guns and bombs was used . They said , homemade knives . Do you know what a homemade knife is called ? SHANK ! It s a prison weapon , we invented that shit . So I know it couldn t have been a plane for a bunch of ignorant niggas that would have been a different phone call . Like , whips , ho , ho , summer , we were trying to take over the plane . As soon as we pulled our knife , all the niggas say , oh , no , you didn t . I got to go and call you back . La , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la . Brothers would have called air traffic control , like , yeah , this time wrong . They tried to get us with knives . Oh , no , we whooped ass , but where the manual at ? I got to land this motherfucker . I got to get back to Brooklyn . I got shit to do . And I get tired of them fucking with me at the airport . Why I got to be the one randomly selected to have my shit searched ? I even get mad for white people when they search y all shit . Cause again , I know it s gonna sound a little bit racist , but let s be real . Black people , white people , Asians , Latinos , we not known for blowing shit up . Black people , we have specific crimes . We do shit like rob a 7 11 and kill everybody in that motherfucker . For 4 . 80 , for bag of Doritos and the pack of new ports . That s a niggas shit . You want to search somebody ? Search that motherfucker who name sound like a pubic hair , caught in your esophagus . Fuck , and leave me the fuck alone . I m not trying to blow shit up . I m trying to smuggle , join , play Xbox and rub one out . That s what the fuck I m trying to do . Cause trust me , when I explode , this is the bomb right here . I ll be walking around the house terrorizing shit , I m gonna blow up to puppy . So racism shit is affecting every aspect of life . Even my business , the movie business . Like , it s certain movie roles , black people , we just don t get a lot of . Like , I ve noticed since the late 90s horror movies made a hell of a comeback . </s> <s> White people , y all get all the horror flicks . Y all get the chucky and I know about last week and all that shit . It s your man , I say , how come you don t see black people in horror movies ? And I put it together . You can t make horror movies with us . Cause it ain t gonna be a movie , it s gonna be a fucking commercial . Like people , y all know , we don t fuck around . We can be having a party in the woods , jamming . I m gonna fuck , how loud the music is , how much fun we have . If we hear some shit that don t sound right , it ll cut through all that shit . We be out there dancing like , woo , this shit is hot . What the fuck was that ? I don t know , nigga , but we gotta pack it up and roll . This shit don t fool . White people , y all gonna be out there dancing ? Y all dance like two year old black babies . Y all hear some shit , what was that ? I don t know , let s go check it out . And why do white women fall when y all run ? What s that shit about ? Every time , oh my god . Black women hear some , she take off the pumps and put on air Jordans . She might start out running , but that bitch is gonna turn in the nascar like , White guys are faithful , your ladies fall , y all go back . Black women , we love you , but if you fall , fuck it . We might try and come back , if you like , oh my god . Bitch , come on ! Hey bitch , go on , dumb . God damn , that was some good pussy too . Ladies , work on your time and that s all I m saying . You know , real black women be waiting for you at the car file and how flinging else . And they go , where was you ? You say , come on , so I ll come out . I m actually on a mission , man . I don t even think comedy is my calling in life . I think I m meant for something greater . Like I had a vision the other night it came to me . I think my mission in life is to help white people . Like really , I want to feel comfortable enough to walk in your house unannounced . At three o clock in the morning . Just wake you up and go come with me . Like comics , we don t do shit and we on a road except staying hotel room and watch TV . And I m flipping through some of the stations and I m watching these programs like Oprah and Phil . And I m seeing some of y all s kids as out of fucking control . I really want to ask white people , I ve always been curious . Why don t y all just beat your kids , man ? Beat them , what they motherfucking ass be ? </s> <s> Y all give y all kids all kind of timeouts and special places . The fuck is a special place ? To a black child , that s a coma . What is a special place ? Black kids don t know shit about timeout . We nobody s knocked the fuck out . My mother used to slap the shit out of me in public and I would look at people for help . Like shut up . White people felt my pain . Oh my god . She just struck her child . Black people see black kids get hit , we be like , hey . Get y all shit together . Black people will beat other people s kids if they fucking up too bad . Like , miss , you need to flip this ugly motherfucker . Put that shit down . Here s my website email home address . Call me , I ll fuck him up in a damn you need . You ain t got to kill him , just watch him turn red . Just choke him out . You know what I found out growing up , totally shocked me . White kids are just as shocked to find out black kids don t talk back to their parents . As we are , we hear him talk back to theirs . So he s have a little buddy who would come over my house on the weekends . A little Nate . We be on my own playing video games . One of these succumbent to rumor on us . Cust me out for no reason . Just scared of shit out of both of them . We be on the room playing Mario Brothers . She come kick open the door like SWAT . We be on level four . Here is how many times I told you to clean this motherfucker room . Cut that goddamn game off the clean this room . I come back this motherfucker room and clean . I ma take that into the court . Wrap it around your neck and stick it in your ass . Dig a ain t playing but you this ain t no threat . This is a promise . Try me motherfucker . Try me . My wife and my wife would turn to me offended like dude . What the fuck ? She can t do that man . This is your space . This is your area . She s violating your right to privacy . You should say something . You want me to go say something ? I d be so scared . I saw it talking to him like a slave from roots . He was gonna get me and troubles me . I like you Nate . I really do . My parents is good black folk . They give us some food . They give us some sleep . You can t wait from around here with that foolishness . Go get from here . Mm . Bo lo ! My mother smacked her shit out of the white boy . He turned into me . Whaaat in the water . </s> <s> Whaaat in the water . My mother was a champ at Whippin As , too man . She had a gold belt and everything . I remember one time I stole a bike . And she had to leave her job to get me out of jail . You know you grew up in a single pronged household with a black woman and she got to leave work to get you out . I knew I was going to that special place . I knew the ass boobin was serious because when we got home she took her work clothes off and put on a jogging suit and headband . Like what kind of ass boobin is that ? You prepared to sweat . She had a stopwatch and a bottle of gatorade with the belt . I said at some point this bitch is fittin to refuel . On this ass boobin . I think my mother took special joy out of fuckin me up , too man . She came up with unconventional methods of whoopin ass . Shit that I knew far exceeded normal and necessary . I remember one time she woke me up out my sleep at three o clock in the morning . You know you ve been woken about your sleep . You know when that light hits you , hit you a second to get your shit together . You be this combobulated . And I m eight . She came and kicked the side of the bed . Nika get the fuck up . You thought I forgot about that shit you did earlier . You gonna go and get suspended from that private school where I ll make all that money and work two hard jobs and you gonna get suspended by telling the teacher to suck your dick . Here put this on . And she threw some boxin head gear at me . You know that leather helmet boxers be wearing for practice fights ? I m like , my wife puttin on boxin head gear . She said , cause I m gonna hit you in head with a pipe and I don t wanna kill you . Cause you my baby , I love you . I ve just always been envious of the relationship the white parents have with your kids , man . You guys actually have a democracy in your household . You actually care . About your kids opinions . Which is why you don t understand why they run rampant over you at the same time . I grew up with a lot of white kids . I d hit their parents complaining mine . It was always the same argument . I don t understand why my child talks me this way . Such disrespect . I don t know what to do . I met my whits and promise a lot of you guys put your kids on the same level as you . You can sit at them your contemporaries . How you put somebody on the same level as you that can t pay the rent or the mortgage , put food in a refrigerator or keep the fucking lights on ? They re not your contemporaries . They re your kids . Moral of the story . Beat their mother fucking ass . </s> <s> There s something about pain and make some motherfuckers listen . Like I just saw this show the nanny . I could not believe this shit exists . Y all have flown in English bitchin to tell you how to deal with your kids . And she always has some profound shit to say . You must ignore the child s behavior but not the child . The fuck outta here . They should redo that show . Call it the niggas nanny . It d be three minutes long . She shoved to the door . Boom boom . And she got pow sho over theme song niggas nanny . That s it . No commercial breaks . One episode is over . Y all s gonna be some white people driving over singing that shit . Niggas nanny . Roll the windows up . I m in the mood . Where do we eat smokers at ? Fuck that y all cops . That was a test real weed smokers on y all out . We got codes . I like smokin weed . Yo , it s cool about smokin weed . It makes you think about shit you normally wouldn t think about . Like I was sitting around the house , so they smoke weed . And I got to think it . Is it possible for a male midget ? I gotta be had to be thinking about midgets . It says it s impossible for a male midget to have a real big dick . Like I ain t no no gays yet , but everything on a midget be tiny . You ever see they fingers ? They look like the little orange baby carrots . You ever see ? Like could a midget actually have some shit like this ? And I actually know famous midget people . Like I m good friends with little website . I got his number on my cell phone . I don t know why , but I got the shit . And I was hanging out with little website one time and he told me some shit that blew my mind . He says when he has sex , he don t like fucking women his size . He like the fuck normal size women . And I was sitting around the house , smoking weed . And I got thinking , if little website was fucking a grown size woman , doggy style . Is he actually standing up in the bed ? Like you get a woman on all fours on a mattress . You ll see , is he standing straight up in the mat ? Like if you walked in on some shit like that , your instinct would be to leave . But you ll check that shit out for a hot second . But you walk in like , oh shit , I m sorry . Look at this , this is crazy . No , he s standing on a Nike shoe box . I can t believe this shit . And I don t think we value midgets enough . I think we take them for granted . Because I don t give a fuck how bad your day is . You see a midget , you perk up . Because when you leave your house , you re not guaranteed to have a midget sighting . </s> <s> You re not guaranteed . How often do you leave your house and spot a midget ? It s rare .

You ve never seen that . I remember one time , I saw 15 midgets walking down the street . I had a taste for hot wings all of a sudden . They like the little drum at peace . They like the small of , okay . I remember I told that joke one time . It was an actual midget in the crowd . He got pissed off . He sent some shit , fuck my whole night up . He was like , nigga , watch your nuts . I was like , what ? I got to watch my back a few times . But I have never had to watch my nuts . I was scared . I went straight home . My girl was like , I thought you was with your boys . I said , midget told me , watch my nuts . I m serious . I filed a police report and everything . I m like , he bought this high . He had on , I m a little propeller hat . The motherfucker nipped me on the way . It was terrible . Like I said , I don t drink with white people . And I don t smoke weed with Asians . Again , not that I got anything against Asian people . It s just your fuck up my high , man . You know , when you smoke weed , the point is to be in a happy place . I m not supposed to be thinking about traumatic shit . Every time I smoke weed with my Asian friends , I be thinking , then my fuck is a dead . Because you know , when you smoke your eyes , close a little bit . And they three quarters of the way there . That shit be confusing . I be three hits in . I m like , take me ! Like , nigga , I m up . I m just high . I said , all right , we ll do like this every five minutes or something . nigga , let me . All right , to smoke weed and watch National Geographic . Because I like the Nature Channel . Like , I want to go to Africa one day going to Safari . See the animals and the natural habitat . But the difference between us and yours , we stay in the truck . Why people , y all got some shit called up close and personal . Like , it s just mazing too . Because that s what black people , we just know certain shit . Like , why people , that s why I study y all , envy y all . I m envious of y all . Y all a race , y all do whatever the fuck you don t want to do . Y all a free . Y all only race the people that could look at a wild lion and go , I can be friends with that . That s why y all are always on when animals attack . You will never see black people on when animals attack . </s> <s> You might see us on when cops attack , but you will never see us on when animals attack . Y all would do shit like tranquilize a lion and hold that motherfucker till he wake up . And that be heavy shit to y all , y all be in the camera . Well , my partner , Bob and I , we ve been tracking this particular beast for quite some time . Her name is Utuulu , she s six months old . We just shot her with five CCs of tetra cordaline darts . When she gets up , she s gonna be fucking pissed . Oh my god , Bob , do you feel your heart pounding ? This is amazing . Oh my god , she s getting a blow . She modeled me with an experience . The Africans don t be out there fucking with the lions . They ask them , Mr . Matumbu , why you don t pay with the lions ? I m not fucking with that motherfucker . Fuck him and fuck you . That shit is not any brochure . I m not doing that shit . When my shift is over , I want to go home to my children . Mangulu , Mungala , and , oh , oh , oh , oh , I kind of fucking do that .

I want to piss you off and you , mo de naszym , fuck up . I want to piss you off . I want to piss you off . You know what s fucked up ? African people don t like black people . You know , they treat us like shit . They talk down to us , they think they better than us . And I don t understand , because we re from the same tribe kind of . But they like white people though , they treat y all like family . So y all come around , they get excited . Excuse me , Mr . Whiteman . Thank you for bringing us here . We love you . Yeah , the Whiteman . So as they say , they get attitude . Hey , how you doing ? This is nigga . We don t like the black man in America . Motherfucker , you don t work , you don t do shit . We don t like you , you black mo de fuck out . Like , who are you calling black , motherfucker ? I m brown , you midnight . Who the fuck are you calling black ? Like , nigga , if you sit up against the building , you look like an alley . Who the fuck are you calling black ? The shit is unjust . African men don t understand why when they come to America , they have a hard time getting American pussy . </s> <s> You can t beat out aggressive with American women , especially black women . You gotta know how to talk , you gotta come correct . Mom , because in Africa is used to having a way , they got 15 wives and shit . And African women are very obedient . They tell they women want to do , it s not even an issue . Bitch , when they come home , you . . . I don t know why they do that . You better clean this shit from the floor . Maybe in the club stalking women out here . You can t even see them , they be as black as my jacket . You just see the yellow what they ask from a distance . Looking like Congo in the bush . As soon as you go buy your drink , they jump out the shadows and scare the shit out you . Bitch , what is your name ? Come here . Don t run from me . You re going to be my wife . I think that s the key to racism , no . You gotta be willing to invest in other people s cultures . To end of the day , I don t give fuck , what color you are . Everybody got something to bring to the table . Life is short , man , sample that shit , you don t know what you might be missing . Why deprive yourself of a great human experience because you fucking mad , it s ridiculous . That s why I appreciate a good culture , I appreciate a good accent . You got the right accent , you can get away with a lot of shit . You be in the club and say something foul to a woman in an American accent . She might slap the shit out of you . Like , excuse me baby , I m mean to bother you , but you got a fat ass . I love to take you home , fuck the shit out of you . Mother fucker , psh .

I don t want much , just want you to polish me now , if you know what I m like . I ain t even gonna lie , I ll use that shit to get some pussy . I walk up to a woman and say anything . Excuse me , you know what time it is . Oh my god , the accent is beautiful , where are you from ? I just make shit up , McDonald s England , have you ever heard of it ? </s> <s> I live right off of Egg McMuffin Lane , have you ever heard of it ? Oh my god , girl , you live off of Egg McMuffin , let s go . I tell you what accent is , not sexy , is that East Indian accent . That 7 Eleven shit , that turban shit , that dot towel shit ? Ladies , trust me , you do not want that on top of you on a Saturday night . I m going to give it to you . I know you ve wanted you , Danny Bitch , and I have wanted you . I m going to give you my Vagasani beef , you motherfucker . Say my name , say , Pumasanji , Pumasanji . What s up , my dralls ? I m sorry , Pumasanji , I m just not feeling this . Because it s hard to ask a woman for certain sexual favors . Ladies , y all have advantages , y all want to manage some nasty y all ? You re going to all kind of cute little sands and shit , y all you ? Could you please go down town ? How do you ask a woman to gargle your nuts ? Can you gargle my nuts ? Put them in your mouth and grrrrrrrrrrrrr . It s just not sexy . I didn t see my first Indian till I was 15 years old . Fuck me up , I didn t know what to make of them . It s like , what the fuck are you ? Like , I grew up around black people and white people . I knew what that was . I saw an Indian . I was like , what the fuck are you ? You got a niggas skin with white people hair . What the fuck are you ? And you can t call them black . They are dark as us , but they get offended . Hey brother , how you doing ? I m not your brother . Don t call me you , I am not you . They talk all that shit till you pull a gun out to rob them and all of a sudden we re the same . Give me a money , motherfucker . Brother , don t do this . We are the same . Please , you re chocolate , I m peanut butter . We are the racist species . We come together , we are the same . That s what I love about coming back to New York as the culture man , like fucking Italians . Do we have any Italians in here ? Any Italians ? Are you Italian , baby ? I love Italians , man . You don t love about Italian people . Italian people who make up certain words and phrases that only they know what it means . Like , you ever heard an Italian person say this phrase ? Half a bag . What the fuck does that mean ? Are you going to be around an Italian person and say some normal shit like man , you know what ? Usually on the weekends me and my girl go out clubbing and shit , but we decided to stay in this weekend and make it a blockbuster night . So we rented this movie , Steel Magnolias . Now I know it s a chick flick , but I m going to be honest . </s> <s> Towards then I actually choked up , cried a little bit . Whoa , nothing you re selling like half a fake . The fuck does that mean ? Is that mean ? Even when they explain it to you the meaning makes less sense than the term . Like what does that mean ? I don t know you meet a guy and abide your trope back a couple of drinks . Next thing you know you take them to the bathroom , you pull down your trousers , you pull out your cock , you shove it halfway down and stroke somewhere in the process . She go , whoa , it s same for me . Head for fucking fake . Look at that makes no sense . And young brothers kill me because we love Italian culture man . Like the rappers and shit . They always name themselves after old school mobsters and shit . Which is kind of stupid to me because old school Italians hate black people . They call us all kind of muleons and niggas and shit . But the funny thing is like old school Italians are funny because anytime you hang around them they will say the most racist shit in front of you . And as long as they ended with no offense , it s okay . Like I remember one time I went to go visit a friend of mine in a bar in Brooklyn , an Italian neighborhood . I walked in the bar right away to do it knew who I was . He was like , whoa , there he is . Fucking guy from Mad TV , airy spizz . Hey , my friend , let me tell you , me and my kids we watch you every Saturday night . You re the fucking best . You re the fucking best . Bartender for my friend of drink . Let me guess you people . You like the fucking Hennessy . I know . Fuck up because I wanted a Hennessy . I didn t understand . So he gets me to drink and he starts telling the story to his boys and it s the most racist shit ever . Tommy , Mikey , you hear about Richie . He had guys in jail doing a bit . Killed his wife . Quotta fucking a muleon . Can you believe that ? I mean let s be honest . Between yous and me we always knew Jeannie had a thing for the pepper . But to actually fucking eggplant . Can you imagine that ? You kiss your wife goodbye , you get in your car , you drive away , you re two three blocks from your house . You realize , whoa , forgot my fucking glasses . You turn the car around , you go back into the house , you kick open the bedroom door and this year s getting Neil Brazile from Curie s George . But let s look at the bright side , at least it wasn t none of our wives . Can you imagine your wife fucking raising that ? Ah , my don t . God forbid . Hey , Aries , no offense . Salud . That s the most racist shit man . I don t know man , it s fucking crazy . </s> <s> They do make great movies though . I like all those Italian mobs , the movies and shit , you know . Like I m really trying to make it in Hollywood like I want to be a movie star . That s my dream . But I m finding out Hollywood is not what you think it s about . People move out to L . A . thinking this shit is about talent . Shit is not about talent . It s about sex appeal . It s part of my game I got to work on . That ll be in shape to be a movie star man . My problem is I like cupcakes too much . I m serious , sometimes on a Saturday night , if I got a choice between some busy and a cupcake . Sometimes cupcake win . It s kind of like pussy if you think about it . Especially if you heat it up in the microwave for 15 seconds . It s all warm on the inside , creamy in the middle . And when it s over , it s much easier to wash that smell off your dick . I m trying to tell you . Fuck y all , funny to me . I don t give a fuck . Funny to me . It s hard for blacks to make it in Hollywood too man , because the rules are different . You know , Hollywood , you gotta be humble no matter what color you are . But if you re black , you really gotta be fucking humble . You know , because sometimes it don t matter how good you are . I remember I had lunch with Chris Rock one time . He gave me the best advice . He was like , look man , all I can tell you is one , keep writing and two , try not to piss these white folks off . Because that shit is true . It don t matter how good you are . If you re angry , if you re the angry black man , they don t fuck with you . Case in point , Paul Mooney , some motherfuckers are legend . Everybody y all know Paul Mooney . This nigga wrote for Richard Pryon Eddie Murphy . You a bad motherfucker when you writing for other bad motherfuckers . The problem with Paul is , Paul will tell you he s a bad motherfucker . He ll shoot itself in the foot . I remember one time I tried to get him to do a job for Mad TV . I wanted him to be a writer . I said , yo , we already a great show . But Paul , he ll take us to the next level . Paul will go into the fucking meeting and shoot himself in the foot . As soon as he walked in , the producers were like , Paul , Erie s recommend you highly . He thinks you re great . Let me ask you , are you familiar with our show ? Paul went right into it . I ve seen your show . All of you niggas have stolen my material . You ve all stolen from me . I ve seen it . It doesn t matter . No , homie , homie , listen , listen , listen . </s> <s> In living color , satanate and live , you all have stolen my shit . First you stole niggas , then you stole my material .

I m too real . They re scared of me , homie . I m too real . Trust me . They love niggas and grin . When you grin , you win . All the niggas and grin win . Look at it , the Wayne Brady . They love that nigger . That nigger , grins . That nigger has a hairdo from the 50s . He wears a perm . He s a throwback nigger . They love him . They love him . Homie , it s true . White folks will tell you , who I can t you be more like Wayne . We love Wayne . They love grin and niggas . What about that other nigger that played basketball for the Lakers , the Nigger Heels , businesses , the Nigger with AIDS . That s it , Patrick Johnson . They love that grin and nigger . That nigger grinned his way through AIDS . Nigger , it s true . Have you ever seen that nigger s grin ? It s from temple to temple . It s huge . That nigger looks like the cat from Alice in Wonderland . They love that nigger . Here s the thing . If you re not grinning , they ll talk about you . It s scared white folks . It s scared of them . I remember one time I was on a lot and they said , good morning , Paul . And I didn t grin . I just nodded my head . They talk about you . Why is that nigger not grinning ? That nigger doesn t even know where he is . That nigger should be grinning . And if you grin too fast , you scare white folks . I said good morning to a white woman . I grin real fast . That bitch was scared . I said , good morning . She said , that bitch took off winning . Nigger , it s true . Is that nigger gay ? Nigger , it s true . Nigger , it s true . They love it . You got to be humble , man . It s crazy , man . Like , I got a lot of respect for the art , man . Like , I love all of them kind of movies . My favorite movies are them . Gladiator movies . Gladiator with Russell Crowe , Troy with Brad Pitt , Braveheart . I don t even like it for the action and the violence . I like it for the dialogue . That s some smooth shit that way they talk in the movies . So they got their own language . You heard it before . Malod . It s my lord , but that s how they say it . Malod .

Now , let me speak with the nobles or I will engage with my military . </s> <s> It s military , but military . The other characters are with some pompous arrogant asshole .

Now hither away before the third planet from the sun is played by darkness at a command from the higher lords . As for you , my love , only when darkness is among us will I shower you with the fire that burns deep underneath my cloak . For only your seduction can force me to fall to bend it knee and sip the wet spicy nectar which flows from the pearl of your kitty cat . She s like , huh , I m like bitch , I m trying to eat you pussy . I need you to follow me and keep up . I can t work under these conditions . I don t know , man . It s crazy too much . I respect the art . I get upset when I hear about these actors to get paid 20 million of movie to act . And the key word is act . But they pay this adoos who never could fucking act . How do you pay sloan in swaths and negative 20 million of movie ? Pay that to the dudes who deserve it like Pacino , Denero , Denzel . This is a fucking act , man . Because to this day , one of my favorite movies of all time is Heat with Pacino and Denero .

I m gonna have to take you down . I won t like you , but I ll do it . I m not a bad guy . I m a toast . Where I got a big . Denero comes back . You know there s a flip side to that coin .

It was the best thing . Y all so jealous . So I went back to see my doctor . He s like , how you doing with the new medicine ? I say I m wearing a pamper . If you keep me on this , I m going to need a prescription for pamphage . Because when you owe over 40 pounds , they only get you two . You can get down to 10 pounds , you can get 400 of them .

I didn t want three households . Me to be taking care of three different households . I wanted one woman to be the mother of my three kids and I walked through that one house and go to room the room . That s why I ain t got no goddamn money now .

Because I m an independent contract and if I don t work , I don t get paid . There s no sick leave , no nothing . This is what is an independent contract . And I have a personal team . If I miss a payment , she will take me to court . So I put an extra extra case . I get sick . I can take the time off . I m already up to you right now . God helped me that my health stayed good . That means if I keep paying anxious , still not to pay 18 years , the payment is going to stop there 15 . </s> <s> And one thing I know when you get an account of money , they never plan for winning you cuddle .

I sold the team that was worth 4 . 50 . For 2 billion . I m going to give 1 billion for nothing . I know every out these sold the clippers for 2 billion . Every NBA owner was like , man , I need to call somebody a nigger . Probably walk to a black man . Get a nigger , nigger , nigger . Get a nigger . Go ahead , leak it , leak it , leak it . It s the truth , man . I live in LA . I got season tickets to the Lakers . The clippers tickets come with it . The clippers don t got no stadium . They rent out of the staple center . No possession , no pocket . In other words , he sold 15 black men for 2 billion . Nigger , please . Some of y all black men on time . It s got them truth .

And if that s the president that you re going to set , then I was fearful that , hey , man , she the cabinet s . Because if you really understand , if that s what you re going to set , the president don t never ever go to a black barber shop . Because you hear brothers all the time . Fuck that crack up . And then you see him at his job . How you doing , Mr . Charlie ? Good to see you , sir . And I m a hate for somebody bring a tape . Didn t you just say crack up right there ? We need to see you in office . Not a hypocrite because I don t let racist mess with me . Like , they play out with our emotions with it . We already know it exists .

Would you lose your good ass job ? Because you found out she was working for Redneck Hell No . You do what you always do . How you doing , Mr . Charlie ? And curry on by your business . It s just that got them simple . They don t make them lose no job . That s true . But the one killed me more than anything . Oh , Mark Cuban . Mark Cuban came on TV . And we re going to have to have this done . He said , hey man , he has his own presence . He said , if he walking down late at night , buy his stuff with his woman . He sees some young brothers with hoodies coming down the street . He s going to cross the motherfucker street . He said , if he walking down the street and he sees some white dudes with tattoos all on the face , he crosses the street back . </s> <s> And people like Quake , you got to problem with that like now .

The fact that you are a city , my brother , my different mother , Mr . Joe , well being . So what the fuck is going on in Atlanta ? God damn this smells like waiting here . Holy shit , we re all good with it , jail ! I write shit down when I m high and I get mad at myself when I m sober . I wrote this down , a unicorn is a donkey from the future . What the fuck does that mean ? It means it needs to stop smoking so much weed , stupid . Becoming . . . Thanks for not making fun of my haircut right away . I really appreciate that . Yo , I had a tap out to baldness . In certain part of the time you can t keep getting haircuts , we still look like shit . That s just . . . You gotta admit what s going on . Father time , you cruel bitch , you went again . When I was young I had a hair transplant so I have this stupid scar in the back of my head . Do you see that thing right there ? It s like a little smile . It s a dumb thing that I did when I was 20 or in my 20 . When you re young and someone convinces you that you can fix something you don t like about yourself , you can do some stupid shit . And that s the dumbest one ever . Hair transplant , it s one of the most ridiculous ideas ever . You re gonna take a bunch of hair from back here and never falls out . And move it up here where it s fallen out . So it s like taking a bunch of really healthy people and you move them into a neighborhood where everyone s dying . It s their neighbors who just flying off the face of the earth and you re like , what the fuck is going on ? Hold the ground ! Where are we ? It s some shit you can t fix . You can t fix lips . You can try but you re just gonna freak people to fuck out . Okay ? Period . No one has ever taken five days off work and come back or . . . Everybody s like , I like it . I like it . That s better . No , that s a sign you re fucking crazy or you made out with a beehive . Something went wrong . The fuck are you doing , you crazy bitch ? They didn t know . How could they know the first woman to try to lips ? How could they know that it wouldn t work when it worked so well with tits ? See , that s where it s confusing because tits can be ridiculous . They don t . . . they look like fucking staff infections . If your tits were real , you re gonna die . All right ? There s something really . . . They can stick out and stretch the skin . We know . We know what s happening . It s the worst magic trick ever . </s> <s> We know . There s an incision . They stuff a water bag under there . They ll stitch that motherfucker up . They were like , I don t care if I can touch a middle of me . You should dodge me , I m more happy . You re excited . We re weird about visuals , man . People mutilate their kids decks because of visuals . That s what circumcision is about . A lot of people . . . Look , I m circumcised . I didn t ask to be . I m sure a lot of you are circumcised . And I m sure a lot of you circumcised your kids . But when you really stop and think about it , it s kind of fucking crazy . I only have daughters , but me and my wife got an argument about this shit . If we had a kid , I was a boy , I would want him to be circumcised . I go , why ? She goes , because uncut dicks are disgusting . I m like , how many of you see ? It was so confident . It wasn t like she saw two that weren t that pretty , but she was holding out , I hope , for a cute one . I was like , no , I m fucking saying it . No ! No , no , I m just picturing a river of sleepy , uncut dicks in her past . What are you saying ? I m like , that s ridiculous . The way it looks really . . . No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . It looks gross . It s all this extra skin . Like , do you even know what a vagina looks like ? Are you serious here ? Have you ever been sober and squat down in front of a mirror ? And take a good assessment of what the fuck you re packing ? Because let me tell you something , the extra skin might be the best looking part of that contraption . All right ? Because if you pull that apart , you got the predators mouths , right ? And you re really giving me a hard time for some extra dick skin ? How dare you ? How dare you be so minimally committed to this passionate relationship ? I lick your asshole , and you re here complaining about the looks of certain dicks . How rude ! How thoughtless ! And look , man , if you don t lick your girl s ass , all somebody has or somebody will . It s that serious . It s another level of commitment . I would never circumcise my kid , but what I might do is cut it like a crown . Yo , he s the king , man . My kid s the king . Go to the doctor , hey , man , you think you d do that shit and some kind of tribal pattern or something ? What is that ? Fuck is wrong with us . I support gay marriage because I m in a regular marriage and it s gay as fuck . </s> <s> Yeah . Some of these are jokes . My marriage is not , and I should clarify what I mean when I say that marriage is gay . I don t mean it s negative . A lot of people get mad , if you go to a movie , you come out and go , oh man , a movie was gay . Because they re saying , hey , man , what if a gay person hears that and they feel terrible because you re associating something they can t change ? Their sexuality was something negative . And that is not what I mean when I say that marriage is gay . What I mean is that it s like two dudes fucking each other . I ll explain . It s not gay if you re happy . I m happy , man . I love my wife . I love having kids . I ve never been more happy in my life . But I know I m not going through a divorce right now . And that s when shit gets crazy because that s when you all of a sudden have to talk to some people . You don t even know if they decide what happens with all your money . Shit gets nuts when you realize that a lot of the legal system isn t really designed to solve problems . It s designed to make lawyers money . So they re allowed to keep arguing . They fucking keep arguing . You like , can we settle this shit ? And it never gets settled . I watched a friend lose everything he earned in a three year marriage . He worked for ten years , ten , twelve hours a day , and just fucked up and married over his head . Shit got crazy . He had to pay for her lawyer . Do you imagine when it would be lying to go to war for the rest of your money and you have to pay for the enemy s general ? I want him to go fucking crazy . I want him to make red lights just going fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck . You re like , what s wrong , man ? Nothing , nothing , nothing . The dude was just . . . He was murdered , suicidal . We re talking him off the edge . I guarantee you , if you came up to my friend , Matt , at his darkest moment . I said , listen , Matt , I can fix your life . I have a time machine . And this is what we re going to do . I m going to press this button . And we re going to go back in time to the moment before you met your wife . And you are going to get to live your life over again knowing the mistakes of the past . But before we do , suck my cock real quick . That s how gay marriage can get . Because I don t know how you d respond in the same situation . But I m pretty sure my friend Matt would have knocked himself unconscious , sliding into that dude s pelvis . </s> <s> He would have sucked that dick like he was the horn of freedom . Like he was on a cliff with a conch shell . Ooh . Calling battleships . Like he was at the bottom of the ocean breathing through a straw . Ooh . Freedom . And why wouldn t you do it ? Why wouldn t you ? That s all you had . How long can it take ? You get a whole do over . You wouldn t do it . I d say you re gay if you won t do it . You don t want to do all you want to live your whole life in a downward spiral that you re never going to play yourself out of in this economy . Or suck his dick and time travel . What are you a pussy ? Get in there son . That would be my advice . I would say suck his dick and time travel if you can t be me . My other piece of advice would be make sure he really has a time machine first . Okay . The last thing you want to hear after your blood , guys , him laughing about it . That is . . . Bad feeling man . You throwing up in the sink and he s looking for . . . I fucking time machine ! I told you it s my fucking time machine ! Come on man , why you laughing ? Why you laughing man ? You know I ain t got no time machine . Come on man . Cut this shit . Let s be honest with what s going on here . Here s what s going on . You like sucking dicks , but you don t like to take responsibility for your action . Right ? So you get tricked a lot . Hey man , don t cry . Hey listen , listen , listen , listen . Here s what s up . First of all , I ma fucking around . And I do have a time machine . He s no worries man . I got a fucked up sense of humor , but I cried jokes , but here s what s important . I feel bad . I didn t mean to hurt your feelings , and I ma make it up to you . Okay ? Suck it one more time and you could fly . I did . . . I don t feel ridiculous , but if you put that on the paper somewhere , suck my dick and you could use my time machine . Most people would go , get the fuck , but at least once a week . You know what a guy who calls up and goes , cause this work . You re like , that s what you re fishing for man . You re not looking for flounder , right ? You re looking for a very specific type of fish . I did that joke in LA and the guy came up to me after the show and he goes , shouldn t do that joke cause time travel s impossible . He waited , waited , he had to tell me . He got one of those fucking assholes on Twitter that wants to let you know when you re wrong . </s> <s> Dude , time travel s impossible . And I go , what does that mean for now ? Are you sure you know what is going to be possible a million years from now ? That s crazy . Who saw fucking phones coming ? 300 years ago . Who saw 30 years ago looking at a phone and going , someday you re going to watch people fuck on that . There s a lot of shit we don t see coming man . 200 years ago , if you wanted to picture something , you ought to draw it . Think of how stupid people were back then . No one knows what the fuck the future holds . You say it s impossible to have anything in the future silly . The guys , you don t understand science , it s called the grandfather paradox . The reason why time machines impossible is because if you had a time machine , you could go back in time and kill your grandfather before your father was ever conceived . Thus you could have never have existed to make that time machine . And I m like , what kind of an asshole wants to kill his grandpa ? At a old and douchey shit you could do with a time machine ? That s the name of a scientific principle really . How about go back to high school and fuck everyone , Paradox ? You know ? I wouldn t kill grandpa but I fucked the shit out of a few confused 18 year olds . If all of a sudden I found myself back in 1985 , oh shit , I might be running things . I would go straight pants purple rain on those hookers , alright ? That I might do , yeah that s creepy but what am I gonna do ? I time traveled . Am I sure about Hitler s taking a shit and punching right in the deck ? Do you imagine if you could just pinpoint your location , sharpen Hitler s bathroom , all these jewels , I hate these jewels . Ha ! You disappear , he s screaming , guys come here with guns . And the best part about that is you could do that over and over again , you have a time machine . Come back anytime you want . You could do it one tenth of a second earlier every time he never sees you come home . Then after like a couple of weeks of it he starts to recognize you . There s like a hole in the space time right before you punch him . YOOH ! I might do that . You would have to be there right when the time machine is invented though . Otherwise it would already be done . You know ? Like you would say dude let s go back in time and shit on Hitler s head . Fuck awesome . By the time you think about that , when you appear in the past you will be on a mountain of human shit twice the size of Everest . Come on fuck it s freezing up here ! We were so unoriginal ! The idea that if you had a time machine you could fuck the whole world up therefore people wouldn t use it . And my idea is ridiculous because you look at the shit that we have that might fuck the world up that we already used . </s> <s> Like nuclear power ! You see what s going on in Japan ? That s fucking scary ! They don t know how to turn nuclear power plants off . Did you ever even guess that that was the case ? When you have assumed there was a conversation about that back in 1970 ? Hey man what happens if the power goes out ? Dude don t be negative . It s not gonna go out . We re just gonna build this sun out in the field . We re pretty sure we can keep it cool . We re gonna eat through the fucking earth . What are you children making shit ? What the fuck are you doing ? They want to be cool at off so they poured millions of gallons of ocean water on it . And then they pour that water right back in the ocean . Like do you motherfuckers not watch your own monster movies ? You guys made Godzilla ! And that was your solution ? That s like a kid spilling a gallon of milk and then cleaning it up with his underwear . It s like what are you doing you fuck ? You made an even bigger mess and you re naked . Get out of here . Let me handle this . Gonna put a big fence around this fucking place . People are crazy . We re a bunch of button pushing monkeys man . I think that people are responsible for the big bang . And it s the stupidest idea I ve ever come up with . And it s not even real I m not idea because I was hiding a pot brownie in an isolation tank when I came up with it . But the idea is we re fascinated by technology . The biggest experiment right now is the Large Hadron Collider . You guys know what that is ? It s the biggest experiment in human history . 10 , 000 different scientists from 100 different countries . And they made this 22 mile long something fucking machine that s spinning these atoms around a hair under the speed of light . They re gonna slam them in each other and make little black holes . What s crazy about that is those particle physicist dudes that nobody understands . One of their theories is that inside every black hole may be a whole other universe . And that what the whole universe might be is galaxies inside every galaxy is a black hole inside that black hole . Hundreds of billions of galaxies each with black holes in the center each with hundreds of billions of galaxies and it s fractal and it will go on forever . And they re just making this shit and switching on . It s a bunch of fucking dudes . And everybody s like , well we gotta stop gay marriage . I ll tell you right now they know gay guys gonna leave next door to me and sleep me like in the middle of the night . And they leave me like an equal with his little wife . We are gonna make the fucking big bang . And I know it sounds ridiculous . And especially coming from the fear factor guy loses all credibility . But if you stop and think about it man , they don t know how the universe started . The big theory is the big bang and that theory states that 14 billion years ago the whole universe was smaller than the head of a pen . </s> <s> But something happened and exploded and created everything we see in the sky to that . I think 14 billion years ago there were some scientists . And they were probably autistic and they were on anti anxiety medication and they would drink in red ball and no one touched them . They would masturbate and they never cried and they made a big bang machine . And they sat around and looked at it one guy went , I ll fucking press it . And he hit that thing and the whole sky went , shhh . And it s a reset button for the universe and every 14 billion years we hit it one second quick girl . And that s infinity . Maybe or maybe I was highest fucking I m just making shit up . Okay . Just like those assholes that made the mind calendar , alright ? Maybe just enjoy your time here . Don t fucking sweat the doom and gloom , yo . If you have friends that are into the mind calendar , man , that shit s annoying as hell . Bro , the Mayans dude . Bro , ancient knowledge , you don t respect the Mayans . The Mayans had amazing technology . The Mayans could predict lunar eclipse as a thousand years in the future . Did you know they figured that out ? Did you know they hadn t figured out shoes ? We can learn shit from the Mayans like how much mushrooms not to do . How about that ? Building awesome society and then start playing football with human heads . They played a football game with human heads where they sacrifice the winning team . How high do you have to be to even bring that up in a meeting ? They like had their hands and they didn t even know the world . They were ridiculous , man . They were silly people . They re not here anymore . They never saw that common yet we think they figured out the fucking end of the world . Really ? Dude , the Mayans were wise , bro . You re being so uncharacteristically harsh . The Mayans knew about the bird deaths . They knew about the fish deaths . They predicted these . The mass animal extinction events . Have you seen the bird deaths ? People like , whoa , dude . There s a thousand birds dead in South Dakota . You know what my response is ? Maybe they realized they were birds in South Dakota . They just flew into each other at full speed . What in the shit life is that ? If you woke up tomorrow and realized you were a bird in South Dakota , you d fly right into a fucking electrical tower . Can a shit exist ? And how do we know that the bird death was a bad thing ? How do we know it wasn t just one badass worm that became a fucking sorcerer ? Got tired of this con birds eating his whole worm family . So we put it in a hat with moons and lightning bolts on it . Fire came from his head and the birds fell on the sky . </s> <s> How come it can t be a happy story ? Fuck birds . I m on team people . All right ? Period . Talked your crazy shit with me . I used to love nature far more until my dog had eaten by a mountain lion . Which is , I ve told the story in the podcast . And a lot of people don t take it s true . It is a true story . I was living in Colorado for a short period of time and I saw a fucking mountain lion in my backyard . About as far as that gentleman with the backwards baseball cap . This is how far it was . I m sitting on my porch , right ? So my porch is right here in the door to my house is right here . Not that far away , right ? Fucking the mountain lion s wing out there . I know there was a mountain lion there . I m just sitting in the back porch going , it s crazy to let you live out here . It s where you can just , you know , you get a house out here . You just live in the woods . But it is . It wasn t a fucking dog . And this is why I panicked when I saw the tail . Because it was moving in between the trees . You see like parts of its body . What the fuck is that ? And I see this creepy ass motherfucker tail . That s how I knew was a mountain lion . Because nothing that s nice has a tail like that . Look , that s a tail of something that s thinking about fucking someone up on the sneak tip . It moved out of the woods and it popped its head between two trees . And we made eye contact . And I did not mean to do this , but my whole body dropped by two inches and I went , oh ! Like there was no chest , puffed , what bitch ? Did you the fuck around on my lawn ? I was thinking it was , I was sitting in the porch , I was looking at the door and like , I don t think I m gonna make it . I just looked at this thing and the realization that I fucked up , it was so strong . It was such like , what did you do ? What the fuck are you doing ? The only thing that s close to that feeling is when you re talking to a girl and halfway through the conversation you realize , this is a dude . And I couldn t figure out how to approach the situation . Do you fucking run for it ? That instincts kick in ? That s such a thing . Or do you treat it like an asshole on just starting moving a little bit at a time ? Like , what do you think I m stupid bitch ? You don t know what the fuck you re doing ? It took off , it eventually took off . I , I , I , it ate my dog . That s a true story . It was a weak layer to eat my fucking dog . </s> <s> It was casing my house . That was weird . But what was really weird is how the police deal with it . I called the cop up and I go , hey man , a mountain lion ate my dog . He goes , you gotta keep him inside at night . I decided right then I was moving . I was like , what the fuck are you talking about ? Did you not , did you say , I thought I heard you , did you say you gotta kill everything that eats dogs ? That s what cops should say , right ? You don t kill them ? You don t kill these dog eating monsters ? He goes , hey , hey , hey , no , of course we don t kill them . It s against the law . We need them . You need them . They keep the deer population down . Do you know the deer are not bulletproof and they re made out of food ? So , what you re telling me is that you need monsters just wandering through the woods , eating up all the extra food . Who the fuck let you in charge ? You crazy legacy thinking assholes . It s nature , man . It s like granola . They had to sign up if you get attacked by a bear played dead . If you get attacked by a mountain lion , fight back . Really , you got signs on how to fight monsters ? Why don t you burn these fucking trees down ? You got monsters hiding in the tree . How much do you really like looking at trees ? You need a certain amount of nature in your life . You don t want to go completely no nature . That s not good . People left up to their own devices . That s Las Vegas . That s only good for a visit . It s only good for a You re not supposed to live anywhere where they let you drink 24 hours a day . That s fucked up . And they give you three booze when you re gambling . Oh , fuck you . That s crazy . How is that the law ? And it s all red bull plus something . So , you got a fucking chemical batter going on . You re consciousness . Half of you sped up . The other half is fucked up . So , it s just seesaw battle , retardation . When you re on red bull and whatever , and it s like nine o clock in the morning , you don t even know who the fuck you are . You got one cylinder that s just moving your feet in certain directions , making up decisions , and what are you going to eat ? We went to the Spirament Rhino Strip Club at 9 . 30 a . m . on a Thursday . Yeah . And it was packed . </s> <s> That s what was really depressing . That s one of those dumb red bull and vodka moments . We were too stupid to be making your own decisions . We were eating breakfast . We were down to two word sentences . We were just like , waffles , bitch . You know how you get there ? You know how you get there ? You get to those . . . And nobody says anything for a minute . Somebody goes , word . And all I m thinking of is sleep . And all I m thinking is , oh , I can t wait to hit that pillow . And I m like , hey , man , you guys want to go to the rhino ? And I m like , fuck . That s my voice . So I look at that and see if they heard it too . And they re like , it s open . It is open . It would be open right now . All men need is one dude in the group that s more fucked up than everybody else . And then they feel normal . You know , you could be the craziest whormonger of all time . I m not like Jimmy . Jimmy s a fucking animal . He doesn t need that one dude . Let s go to the game . Let s get coke and hookers . And then this silence in someone goes , are you serious ? Who s serious ? And then you always have to have a conversation with the wife . Why are you even hanging around with him ? He s so beneath you . I m loyal . He s a good buddy . I don t agree with the way he thinks about women . No , man . We got there and it was packed . He was nowhere to sit . It was like the opening scene from Blade . I was on so many different things . I smoked some pot . I ate some pot . I drank a lot of whiskey . There was a lot of things going on . You know those moments you have when you re pissing ? When you go to reevaluate your life when you re hammered ? Ladies , I m sure you have those too . But it s a different thing . For dudes , it s like this blank moment . Almost like an isolation tank . I m scared of white surface . When you re pissing , you re like , I probably should just get the fuck out of here , right ? Kind of a joke is that . Fucking ridiculous , man . I m preparing for the apocalypse . I thought the apocalypse wasn t going to happen as soon as Rick Santorum dropped out of the race . Wow . I don t know if Rick Santorum has ever had gay sex , but I m pretty sure it s on his bucket list . How about that ? How about that ? You weak , chin bitch . You want to be the king ? How dare you ? And this is how you can tell that a man cannot be in charge when he concerns himself with trivial matters . My gay marriage . There s only two reasons that you hate gay marriage . It s one , your dumb or two , you re secretly worried that Dixor delicious . </s> <s> It s all that s there . You can see in his face , whose small jaw he s just fighting the gay . He and Sarah Palin could have got 100 of the retarded market . That was a dangerous time for us . That s why I think the minds are wrong . There s a lot of people that hate Sarah Palin , but I do not . I don t find anything wrong with her . There s nothing that she does that I probably wouldn t do . I don t think the same things that she does , but she s not qualified to be vice president . And near her mind . But if they ask me , I d probably fucking do it . I d give it a shot . I d be like , how much was Joe Biden work ? Is that guy even get up before noon ? Would the country be exactly the same if Joe Biden didn t exist ? I say yes . I say to wouldn t be a fucking thing , Jay . I could do his job with three extra emails a day . I really don t find . . . I can t get like 500 , 000 extra Twitter followers , man . That s no Joe . That shit s viral . So why shouldn t she do it ? Sarah Palin s living in the fucking frozen North . She s not even in America . She s living up in some places that are not attached . And everything that s not attached is just some shit we stole . That she is the queen of a frozen Puerto Rico . That s what the fuck is going on . So she s living up there in the ass . Do you want to be a millionaire ? She s like , wow , and I d rather just dodge moose on the way home every fucking day . I d rather freeze his death walkin to get my mail . What do you expect , man ? What do you want her to do ? She s like , what the fuck a dumb should never read ? So I m like , what do you ? You re gonna be honest ? Oh , my best friends don t read . How about that ? She talks a lot of shit . She s no one she s talking about . You bitch . How about that ? I put Google out on your ass all the time , son . Bro , I didn t even see the fucking flush . She s not even hot . She s not maybe at Lannaheat , but I ll tell you what she is . She s a Baton d Orf Iowa holiday in Hotel Bar 1am . Three fucking coaks hot as fuck . How about that ? They know this mutant that there s a reason people are cheering . That s a goddamn truth . </s> <s> That s some goddamn truth . She leaned over the chip finger nails and cigarette and whiskey breath and said , let s get the fuck out of here . You re like , let s get the fuck out of here , baby . Woo ! But she can t be fucking president . Slow down . Slow down , son . This because you want a fucker doesn t mean she can be the queen . Settle . There s a lot of bitch men out there that think life is a Kevin Costume movie and they re waiting line to buy a book from her . She s gonna suck your weight in line to get a book signed by a chick who doesn t read books . Come here , son . Have you ever done squats ? Do you know about beep squats ? You know about dead lifts ? You know about bison meat . It s really healthy for you . Well Sarah Palin , I just think is the only hope for the conservative movement in this country . They have like a plan speech to meet her . Mrs . Palin , I just want to say that you make me proud to be an American . And I think you re probably the only hope for the right in this country . And I just want to shake your hand . And as soon as they touch hand , if you re not to this path . Oh ! They tackle them in tasum . First of all , she s wearing glasses and that s a goddamn dirty trick and every man knows this . It s a goddamn dirty trick . We might not know this because you don t know fucked up what we really are . And this is nothing we re proud of but I m going to be honest and everyone will back me up . When a man meets a woman and she s wearing glasses , the very first thing that pops into his head is I wonder what it would look like if I came on those glasses . We re not proud . It s not something we dwell on but it fucking pops in there man . Just get it down . Stop it all that . You know , the proportion of me YouTube is just plain . You know , but you don t want it as well but it s not fair man . She can get fucking contacts . She knows what she s doing . She s standing a signal . What s up with this ? Plus she lives in Alaska . Man , I think if you live in Alaska you probably have to have glasses on just her protection . There s probably only like 10 chicks up there . Dude , you re talking about a bunch and fucking fucking fucking fucking shit . Yakin off of people s faces . Big Yosemite Sam Mustache . He s waiting for women behind bushes . She s probably got 2020 vision . That s probably a protection issue . I m really the same . I really do think she s a nice lady . </s> <s> This is why I say this . They wrote a tell all book on her . They went to her town . He lived next door to her for a year . And wrote a tell all book . And the worst dirt he could dig out was that she might have had an affair . With a jet ski salesman . And I m like , do you have any idea how persuasive you would have to be ? To be a jet ski salesman in Alaska ? I mean , are you really blaming her for that ? That guy might be able to fuck everyone in this room before we even knew what happened . That guy might be a fucking hypnotist . He s selling watercraft in a place where everything s frozen . Are we really discounting his pill game ? Stop there hunting moose and shit . What s he going to do ? Maybe you need a jet ski ? I like working for the UFC , but I don t like being around that many men who can rape me . It s a part of the problem . Some weird shit that gets set around . I was hanging out with Dan Henderson once and we went to a comedy club . And the guy was heckling at the comedy club . And I go , if you don t shut the fuck up , I m gonna have Dan Harrison fuck you girl from while he holds you down . And I look over at Dan and Dan without missing a beaker . Why would I hold him down when I could just stare him down ? Josh Barnett , that might have been the creepiest shit anybody ever said in front of me in my life . I was like , do you have any feelings for this guy s dreams ? Got a nightmare , is that motherfucker s gonna have for the rest of his life ? This is certain realities man . We are talking to a guy like Brock Lesnar and he s standing over you . There s at least one percent of your brain that s going , please don t fuck me . It s not that he s gay because he s not . It s not that even if he was gay , he couldn t do better than me . He could do way better than me . It s that Brock Lesnar wanted to fuck you . And with his car , what are you gonna do ? Fight it off for a certain amount of time ? When you get that guy s size of Brock Lesnar , he might be able to fuck you on this stage . You want to just drag you up here . And then you see what s wrong with him . And there might be two thousand of us in here waiting for somebody else to say something first . You only want to hear them , I d be able to do something about his Josh . </s> <s> And he may have , I might want to watch this play out and see . But this song goes down . You don t want to be that first dude . Hey man , what are you doing ? It s morally wrong . What ? Box smash you ! Got it . Fuck stampede . I m not really worried that Brock Lesnar would fuck me . But I m really worried is that he would use me as a condom . No fuck , stop , I m way bigger . That s the real fear . I d wind up in the back of his pickup truck with a pair of bolt cutters going , why are we at the zoo ? SHUT UP ! Brock made decisions ! If ten thousand years from now they found Brock Lesnar s body and his right next to David s Bates body . Maybe like these are two totally different species . I think what s going on here is this one would just carry that one around and fuck it whenever he wanted . Like a human flashlight man . Yeah , yeah . I got an argument with my wife about the flashlight man . When the flashlight became a sponsor for my podcast , it was one of the rare moments when me and Mrs . Rogan disagreed with something . She was really serious with me . She s like , I think the flashlight is a terrible sponsor and it s bad for your reputation . Like wow , do you even fucking know me ? How crazy ! I mean like five documentaries on illegal drugs . I used to make people eat animal dicks on TV . And you re thinking that , man , this fake vagina is going to get people the wrong impression . Women don t like it man . Women don t like it . There s something creepy about when you buy something and then you fuck it . There s something creepy . I love you too but this , if your man came home or if you came home rather than your man was banging a flashlight , no one would be happy about that . It s weird . It s weird . There s a certain social weirdness to it . And what that comes from is that sex is supposed to be something that people give you when they like you . They get used to them . They get friendly . They want to give you a faction . Give each other a faction . That s what it s there for . It s sort of like an incentive to be nice to people . I can t not try it for that . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! It s something weird about fucking something instead of a person . You can t masturbate . The problem masturbation really is the fleshless far superior to masturbation because when you masturbate you could feel your hand . So while you re masturbating at least 50 of your brain is going , dude you gotta dick in your hand ! And then 25 of your brain is like , we got it . It s our dick . It s cool . And then the remaining 25 is going , Aaaaah ! Aaaaah ! That is the pie shark of the male mind during masturbation . </s> <s> And . . . Thank you . And when you masturbate there s no room for other thoughts . You can t like , take some sports scores in there . You know , I owe some money . Now , man , it s like , and that s it . Or you don t beat off . You know , the dog shits in the living room . You stop . What the fuck are you doing , man ? Can t just keep going . Fleshlight changes everything . It does not feel like masturbation . It feels like real sex . It feels great until you orgasm . And then that great feeling is replaced with a deep sadness . You realize who you are . This is you . This is you and your best . This is you at the . . . This moment right now you ve lived your whole life . You ve learned all your lessons . And here you are . Still fucking out . Here you are . Here you are . Nothing in your plastic tube . Oh ! You didn t even know your pants are off . You fucking sloped . You see ? Ooh ! I don t care who you are . You can be the biggest winner of all time . You can be Michael Jordan . As you re nothing into a fleshlight , you re like , oh ! Michael Jordan s disappointed in Michael Jordan . Fuck this wall with me . Whoa ! I m never gonna learn . In a real dark moment comes , you have to clean that fucking thing . Is that some only time you can t pretend you do anything else ? When you fucking it , you can pretend you re just real sex . Woo hoo hoo ! But when you clean everything , you gotta unscrew the bottom and release the cracking of shame . It just slides out of the tube like a slug that got been hit with a mallet . And your nose looks so unimpressed when they re in a sink . You re like , how does that make a person that lazy little second nothing ? You know , sad . I feel bad about my loads . When I was a single man with no children , I looked at my sperm as a completely different thing . Like a lot of you young single with no children people do . You look at your loads as like your Zorro mark . Right ? You re happy when you get a good volume . Right ? When you get a lot , you re like , I m excited about this . Look at all ! But once you have kids and you look at your loads , like those could have been some awesome kids . Instead , they died at the end of a fake vagina . And they died on top of some other sperm that was there from earlier in the day that hadn t bothered cleaning up yet . </s> <s> So , to the last ones , what a shock . It s like getting tossed at the bottom of a pirate ship and it was tackless . Calitants ! It s fucking creepy , man . It s creepy . Mrs . Rogen particularly didn t like the fleshlight because when it became a sponsor for the podcast , it was right after she had given birth to our second child . Now , doctors tell you that when a woman gives birth , she s not allowed to have sex for six weeks . I say eight because I know how I f ! What s wrong ? Imagine telling that to Dr . Bixie on the heart , f ! Six weeks , dude . Her team looks like Nick Niaz s eyebrows . Can t we do a little extra time ? Do you even know what the f you re proposing ? Do you know how I bring the thunder ? I carry all my weight in my hips and ass , bro . Taints go , dude . Taints are not designed to really absorb punishment . They re designed to be the airbags of the vagina . They just give out in case of emergency . Look , man , you don t think about it because you re a man , okay ? Especially men who don t have children . You look at a baby , you look at a vagina , and you go , those are two totally different sizes . Who gives a f ? I m not to worry about that , but you do have to worry about that when you have your own kids . And it comes out of your wives for a vagina . And then you re like , whoa , I never even thought about this . Crazy ! And luckily Mrs . Rogan went with the epidural , which is the way to go , ladies . What the f is this crazy trend to go old fashioned ? When it comes to making babies , like , no , we re gonna use a midwife and we re gonna have it in my bathtub . Ooh ! Why don t you ship that baby on the bottom of a teapy polka hontas ? Go rinse it off and river water it , hide the placenta from the wolves ! You have modern technology that makes you feel nothing while you re pussy explodes . Do you know that a bathtub used to be modern technology ? Yeah ! I was back when they just had only the river ! Crazy f ! Mrs . Rogan went with all the good stuff . She didn t know what was going on . She was totally dumb . It was really crazy . Because they re moving her legs around . It s all like flippity , floppy , and sh . And she had to make a little tent in between her and the baby area . And so Dr . Suclushen . . . Who s like , virtually no pain , it s amazing ! And the teen is going , man . </s> <s> The head s coming out , I got a big head . My kid s up big heads and it s just that s the way it is . And the teen goes like a squirrel tied between trucks . Just . . . And I don t see anything that I see , he sees . And I don t want to be the guy that be like , what the f is this ? You know , to the mic . You got to assume this dude knows what he s doing . He s giving birth to hundreds of babies . That s his thing , man . You know , I just assume . So he gives me . . . he gives me the babies . I go to cut the cord instead of cutting it . I m going to a little sideways thing that happens sometimes . You got to cut something . What a sh way to start a life . Start a life of a dorky f . So I cut the cord . I give my wife the baby , my wife s crying , the baby s crying . I m crying . She s a little girl . Welcome to the world . And all I m thinking the first moments of my daughter s life is , how is he going to fix that tape ? I m thinking how long do I have to look before I check ? You can t just like , take the kid . What the f is going on down here ? The baby looks like a muckis , man . That s what it looks like . You do try to marlin hook and some shoelaces . These tightness thing up and I m watching this go down . My wife just never clue . Here s the tent . She s got the baby . She s like , hey , little girl . Welcome to the world in a body we go like . Yeah . And I m like , this might be the craziest intersection on Earth right here . I m watching two completely different worlds play out right now . And they re on my wife s body . On this side we have love and happiness . The first day of our daughter and right next door is a f hell ranger movie . This just looks like me and looks like me . It gets to a particularly grisly section of a vagina . And as he s forced from the hook to it goes like this . What the f is that ? I lost it . I m like , listen man , I don t have a whole lot of rules in this life . You got to keep it toning your mouth away . It s just not my wife s pussy . Imagine if there s like one dude who was like really good at fisting up pussy . But he was kind of crazy . Oh s t , look what the f I m doing . Oh . Take . I think you just spit on your wife s vagina . Oh mother f you insecure . Listen . My wife doesn t like any of this . If you want to know . </s> <s> Man you have babies and some going to freak you to f out . Freaks you to f out when you like someone more than you like yourself . I was like some shitty lyricist who had Nickelback song . But I really do love my kid more than I like me . And I can prove it . The other day in my house there was two bananas . One of them was yellow and delicious . But the other one was brown and f up . And I wanted a banana . But my daughter loves bananas . She asks for them . She s like daddy can you get me a banana ? Like give them to her and when she eats them she goes . Tell her to show . I didn t even think about it . I just started eating this shitty banana . And while I m eating this f up brown mashed potato textured banana . I m like this is the only person in the world that would make this choice for . Because I love my wife . But if it was just me and my wife I d be like ooh I guess that bitch is getting a shitty banana . Not only that I would leave the pito and rub my balls in the counter . No heaps of lights on this motherf er . So we re a thing man . It s a weird thing we try to grow up . You ever try that shit ? It s creepy . So I m trying to see how fast . Now this is not a text . I m recording . I m recording a show . Well I m filming this but I m also recording myself because I m a f er weirdo . And I have to listen to it in my hotel room . This is the least nervous I ve ever been for a comic special . It s like regular show . It s weird . Every other time I ve done a special . I m f king freak out man . Oh get it right . You guys are so cool . I swear to God I came right on . It was easy . You need to settle down for 20 boy . You re drinking alcohol that is not the 420 medicine . Listen . I m no perfect person . We re all weak inside . Here s something that can make you happier . If you go to an ATM machine . You know a lot of people are quiet at the ATM machine . It s like at a bathroom . This is what I do . And this is what you can do too . But you have to do it all the time . If you re going to commit to this it must be 100 of the time . As soon as the money comes out you go . Dollar Dollar Bill s gone . It s especially fun if you don t know if the money s coming . It s like 60 . You know you re crazy . 60 . Give me 60 . Dollar Dollar Bill s gone . I did it recently in an ATM and there s a dude behind it . The motherfucker you really do do that . Do it man . It makes it more fun . Otherwise it s just weird . Everybody s quiet and thinking someone s going to rob you . </s> <s> Plus it s one of those things where a song got stuck in my head and I had to utilize it . I have a terrible brain for shit that I don t like getting stuck in . If you play me a shitty fucking song there was a band called Imperial Stars that got arrested in Los Angeles . Because they caused a traffic jam . They blocked off the highway with their tour bus and did a music video about traffic . Traffic . It s the worst fucking song ever and I couldn t stop singing it . It was like a Cohen Brothers movie . He got stuck in my head like a goddamn computer virus . This is the worst lyrics of all time . You ready ? I m a rock star living on the edge . I m not for hanging out in party here with my friends . Like someone wrote that down and went , Don t move . Next lyric . That shit is good as it gets . I couldn t stop singing it . I couldn t stop singing it . I was singing it while I was eating . If you were talking and I didn t like what you were saying , it just started playing . And this is where it got terrible . This is where I knew I had a real problem . I was having sex with Mrs . Rogan . And in the middle of it , I was malting the lyrics . You were doing it in a doggy style position when I m like , I m a rock star living on the edge . And then I realized how pathetic that was . And then I got disappointed . And then I lost concentration . And then I started going soft . And then I tried to bring it back . And then I faked an injury . Ah ! Faked ! Ah ! Fuck ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! And you got to do a violent fake injury . You can t bite now . Oh ! You can t fuck through that kind of pain . You got to have some serious , meniscus bucket handle tear shit going on . You can t . And you got to lie , man . It s a time in your marriage when you love someone you got to lie to them . For their own good , as well as your , yes , for your ego , but for herself a steam . Certain shit women don t want to hear . Thank you . I love you too . I love you too . You know , if you re , if you go limp , funny , wife , say , what happened ? What ? Just thinking about this band . I m a rock star . You leave it . I want you to listen to this . Nimmel fuck . How s that ? You bring me back up . I m a rock star . I caught myself singing Hey There Delighted once in an elevator . And I didn t even realize I was singing it , and I noticed that my legs were rubbing together like a cricket . I was alone . I was vulnerable . I was like , oh , what you do to me ? </s> <s> Huh . What s happening ? It s like it s being attacked by a gay ghost . What s going on here ? Where is this going from ? Hey There Delighted once in an elevator . I m a rock star . Don t you want to answer that question ? I bet it s awesome because you re not there . You fucking rhyming stalker weirdo . How about you let her go , dude ? Where s that guy s dad ? And where was he when that boy wanted to play catch ? Huh . Where was he ? Oh , what you do to me ? What , make you write shitty rhymes ? Is that what I do to you ? Is that my legacy ? And I m not saying that I don t like that song because I do . That s what I don t like about it . What I don t like about it is I like it . They got me , those motherfuckers . If I m in my car and no one s in there with me , I ll turn that shit up . I ll sing along . Oh , what ? What I don t like is that they got me . And I think the guys kind of fucking depressed . I don t like getting sucked in anybody s depressed thoughts . I don t mind if what you think it about some kind of stupid shit because I like a lot of stupid shit . I don t think there s any one correct way to live this life . I have a feeling that this life that you and I are experiencing might just be one frame in some infinite movie that goes on forever and makes no sense to any of us . And I think that the one thing that we can really choose to do we can choose to have more fun . We can choose to party more , we can choose to laugh more , we can choose to take shit less seriously , be a cooler person , tip more , cut the crap out of your life , and have yourself a good fucking time . Which is why I like listening to Lutipris . I ve never seen a picture of Lutipris crying . Sometimes I see Lutipris , he s in a crying fool pose . There s girls in there underwear , there s a picnic going on . He s having a great fucking time . Here s one of my favorite all time lyrics . It s from the song Saturday Night . How are you gonna act like my rims ain t clean ? Do you not see the beauty and the poetry of those words ? That s what he s really thinking about . He s not worried about the economy . He doesn t understand the economy . Turns out no one does . Where you know what he knows , he knows he s got enough money to keep his wheels shiny as fuck . So he gets right in front of him and goes , Oh , and he s happy because you can t say shit . Don t . Oh , what you do to me ? What you do to me ? </s> <s> Or I got a big wee stash pocket full of cash just seen a big relapse . Who s party ? What are you going to ? There s one day left on earth . There s an asteroid coming . Who s party ? What are you going to ? Well , we went to the white guy s party , but he was crying and texting . That s all he did . He got a ludicrous disparty . He s making on the roof throwing buckets of ecstasy into the crowd . The asteroids coming . They re trying to hug it . Oh , man , I love you . Ask your life for a party . Got a big wee stash pocket full of cash . Oh , what s to me ? Hey , man , it s the end of the world . We re at Craig s house and we re all reading poetry crying . I wonder if you think I m over here . Yeah , I would , but I m at the Christmas house and it s made out of diamonds . Oh , man , that s a big wee stash pocket full of cash . I became a vegan once I realized that if you don t kill animals , they live forever and become magic . And I got this tattoo . It s an ancient Sanskrit . And what it means is it s a symbol for universal oneness . And that s what I believe , man . I believe that we are all connected , but that insecurity keeps us from recognizing that . But that love , unconditional love , is that brings it all together . So I got this to . Cut to ludicrous . This tattoo says , Bitches , be sucking my dick , yo . Woohoo ! How you gonna act like I don t blow clouds ? Oh , what s to do with me ? I m not . It might be care to sing that song that is to jerk off a look at a man in the eyes . I d say it s a toss up because at least if you jerk off looking at a guy , you could do it crazy . Like , what bitch ? It s like I m scared to come on you . You re dead , don t stare . Especially if you go knuckles up . That s an aggressive posture . You re sending a message like , I don t even want to be cuffed about . Thank you , Ed . Thank you very much . I love you , my love . Thank you very much . You re coming out to my comedy special . Thank you very much . I love you all . </s>"

I m just a little asker so I come out there didn t exactly ever fucking smile on his face . They did a study . The people who get the most sex in Britain is the over 70s . It s an over 70s chat up line sound like , here s a widgey board till your mum will be coming home tonight .

I d love to do a six to nine meter hand but to be honest , this struggle to get back up out your bean bags . Cliff Rich , what was in red there the other week ? He gets Alzheimer s , he can sit or commit suicide . Unfortunately then , if you didn t have the presence of mine to say , I know you told me that already . Facebook with a thing , now if you threatened to commit suicide in your Facebook status , they say the law inform authorities within 12 hours . Good news if you were planning on slashing your wrists with a banana . Alright , they re trying to help out with that . I check Facebook every day for people threatening to kill themselves and I try and cheer them up with a quick wee franky likes this . </s> <s> So you take a graduate document , you re about to assist it to your side . I couldn t watch the bit where the old guy died . Because I was coming so hard that my glasses fell off . What are you getting some proper fucking trouble on this to the other day ? It s unbeatable and it is not , you never see a shit committing involved in a controversy there . Never switch on the UC . Peter Kay was at the centre of a storm today . Where has Joe come out whether or not you remember daily triangles ? Was blasted by lactose intolerant groups ? Like you should do nostalgia , Peter Kay , I could do that . Do you remember when Peter Kay was good ? There we go . The Sacrification Man Fub for having a wink in a hotel room . He s not only been wanking on the one show is it ? Next up , Phil Tufnall with the best budget lawnmowers . Because he s wanking he s a comedian on tour . I can t come on tour unless I ve wrapped a student in cling film and kicked her body down a motorway lady . TV is a fan , it s a middle class bourgeois fan . You look at daytime TV and how aspirational it is . Then ask yourself , who s watching daytime TV ? Benefit cheats . And it s personal . They don t buy in sell and teaks . They don t renovate houses to sell them on . They don t have stuff in their attic . And if they did have stuff in their attic , it d be fucking shanning Matthews . That was too much fucking brace yourselves . I was a fucking sorbet , a clear the palette . It was looking back on his shanning Matthews material like it was a treasure of childhood holiday in 20 minutes . Or these middle class cute creatures , but they braze a sad lullam . I was showing aimed at the people that are watching it . Two chefs try to remember that they ve left oven chips on . I was showing her goat whan she was walking her makeup to use to cover up a black eye . I want someone on flog it . It s one of the people that watches flog it . I recover in heroin addict prostitute . Have you got to flog for us today ? Well , an MP got me being fucked by a staff at your built area . I enjoyed the European championships I did , but England didn t go out the way I wanted them to . I wanted it to be on penalties , but I wanted John Terry to lose his fucking mind and blast his penalty into the face of a black spectator . Now , I have to be careful her phrase this next bit , but . . . John Terry has a rapist s face . </s> <s> Not serious raped anyone . Not serious raped anyone . All I m saying is if he does rape someone , I get 200 off party power . From a 199 bet . I wouldn t piss on John Terry if it was on fire . In fact , if I d been drinking heavily all day and I really needed a person I d hit to queue to get into the bathroom and John Terry was on fire in the toilet bowl , I d use the sink . The only fluid I d give John Terry s I d whine cone him in a burn s ward if I had AIDS . Open your mouth , John ! Open your burning mouth ! I love the way England always gets you excited in these championships , man . Everyone gets really excited just because Wayne Runein nodded in a goal that could have been put away by Steven Hawking during a power search . Runein s had a hair transplant . Someone should tell the fuck are they doing faces now as well . I d like to see him behind the carols hair . He d look like a rapist cabbage patch though . Should ve got Harry Redknock as my injury , didn t he ? Guy who looks like someone waxed a wumble . I like that band little mix . Juicecase one of them has an entirely oval face . I keep expecting Johnny Wilkinson to run in and put a fucking head off our shoulders . So you can be an embarrassing body as well even take their top off . Just hold the bait on there , X Fact , there isn t an assudalit mentally , I hope people are in there . Let it them on there ! It s supposed to be fucking entertaining . I would be a cyclifer now singing if I had a hammer . So you can link him at the Orchard Ripper but you must have won Hell of a Wank Bank . Product placement in the X Fact are now reckoned as a culture of about six months away from having product placement in the fucking news . I believe soldier died in kinder hard today after stepping on a landmine . Should ve gone to spec save us . Fucking Union Jack dressed in the front of this guy , you fucking trouble . Oh , if you killed it , we ll have a few religious problems here over the years . So let them on mature lady , don t make me sit in that there . So I think you d look good in 1996 . I m only kidding , right before . What are you to twos down there man ? You look like the pad I keep beside my phone . Hey , you re about to have a fucking demo expression now . You know what I mean ? You look like you only remember your own name because your mum s got it tattooed on her lower back . Are you in the madam ? Not saying you look like a skinny , you just look like you d have a pebble dashed for jazzyl . You re brav , you know you re fucking phone in your brav . </s> <s> You did because I fucking saw you from the wings . So when I ll get the wrong number they ll phone up and I ll sign like I m drowning in your tits . It s an actual place for your phone isn t it ? Especially when you re not because I ve got your botlokner in there . Just worry , anyway , would you do ? I m an interior designer . You re an interior designer . I notice some inconsistencies in the way that you ve designed the exterior of your face . Not a terrible way , not an terrible way , but it s not so much eyebrows . So it s more like someone s decided to underline your head . I quote gay eyebrows , why not tell them off and draw them back on with no mirror and a lump of coal ? What are you designing the interiors off ? Officers . People s houses . Who else is houses ? All houses are people s houses . There s no fucking dog house . Whether a dog house is actually to be honest , you re right , you re fucking one step ahead . Consciously when people s houses , that s where the money is , the dogs are going to fuck all . You re not trying to sell a dog a lamp ? You re fucking strung . What the fuck am I talking about now ? What about you man , I said I ve rather strange fucking injury you ve developed there . What happened to you ? You bumped yourself . That sounded awfully deliberate there . Bunk myself . How did you bump yourself ? You got bumped , now you re fucking changed your story . Fucking one cult , there was fucking no fees , lawyers , and suddenly you got bumped out of work . Then I m going to bump yourself . You re gonna fucking fold in the witness box like a red hot mars bar . What happened to you ? A lot of people are coming to me , makes a lot of hot shit in a . . .

How d you put your elbow in something hot ? I just kind of brushed against it and I was fucked . I just brushed against it and I was fucked . I love the understatement to Scottish people , isn t it ? That s what you don t really get us and those kind of 999 rescue shows that America has , you know what I mean ? I was trying not to log in , I just kind of fucked a car into a tree . I ended up fucked , a car was fucked . Three was fucked . I think God there was no hot shit around . I thought I just jumped down and ran my fucking elbow into it , like a man . Do you watch the Royal Jubilee ? I have a theory about the Royal Jubilee that that rain was dianna s teals . But too soon , fuck off .

Stick her cornet on her pony s head until it s a fucking unicorn . It s been a year of organised fun , hasn t it , that in the Olympics . You know , everyone hates organised fun , going out with your work . Best nights this spontaneous night , we end up nuts deep in a dead tranny . I don t know , the Olympics , I couldn t get tickets for the synchronised swimming , so instead I watched a woman drown through a kaleidoscope . Everyone is going on about the dive in , for some reason . It s not even a difficult dive , it s the same dive and both you get a decent swimming baths . Nine or eleven , that was a difficult dive . We re good to see someone grab their ankles on nine or eleven throwing a few turns on the way down . Nice to see someone come down at where a bit of style that , that just . . . Who s one guy surfing down on a desk ? I ve seen that as it was happening and it s taking eleven years to become acceptable . That s a good event , the diverrence only event where if you really fuck up , you re still in gold at the Paralympics . Fucking camp though the dive , and as I said , that in a camp way as well . Fucking camp isn t it ? That d be good if Tom Dalyne was partner , he jumped at the same time and the other guy had to beast him in midair . Or watch the hundred metres and think , this would be a lot more exciting if everybody was on fire . And then the finish line we had a big throw off at water , but we told him it was water and it was petrol . Why was Brent home now ? It s not even a sports country ? Prince not even a sports country ? J . J . B . sports has an escalator to go down one flight of fucking stairs . You should have done it as a lot today , you know ? You get a letter through the post and you go , fucking hell I m doing the triple jump . I ve contested the dive and ends up being that last day Britain s fatest teenager . And she wins because everyone else has to jump in an empty pool . Anyone else watch the dresser ? I don t think ketamine looks fucking amazing . I like the idea fucking Jessica and I said , but I know that in practice my gut would settle into her abs like pancake mix filling up a fucking waffle aisle . Victoria Pendleton can live twice her own body of it . She s sexy because it means she still wouldn t be able to throw me off . She s not at least the heart as the commentary for the women s football and they could have bought the wine . She s the national anthem playing and the camera is going along their faces and I m going five , six and a half , seven and a half , the drink in me . </s> <s> That closing ceremony was shite wasn t it ? Literally our only hope of entertainment there was Al Qaeda . Falky did blow up even the survivors had been applauded in . Even people had been left with one arm and they d been going fucking well done guys that was really stunning . James Bond at the opening ceremony doing a stunt . She d had him do the other stuff point as you know of shagging someone telling a bit of joke . Good if he was bending Jess Kennis over the podium and he turned around the camera and went , I m going for bronze . 18 , 000 troops at the Olympics man how much oil is under that fucking stadium ? I ve got a shooting team must have been shitting themselves and take a shortcut across a sand pit . Some guy has a flashback . Your death ends up being as part of the what happened next round on a question of sport . I don t know if I m supposed to tell you this but I know that for the opening ceremony of the Paralympics , they re actually forming a disabled super group . It s the drummer from death leopard , Michael J . Fox on Maracas , and obviously Darpy . The Olympic talks came through Glasgow followed by a junkie like a giant spoon . The talks she came from , came from the Nazis , came from the 1936 Paralympics . Everyone talks about the 1936 Paralympics . No one mentions the 1936 Berlin Paralympics . It s really fucking kicked off . There s her medal and the showgirls . I know they wanted to go to the Paralympics , I did . Apparently the parkins were going to be an absolute bastard . So the rabia was supposed to send a women s team at the Olympics and I didn t . I was looking forward to their synchronized swimming team in Burkis , bobbin about like a tank full of jellyfish . Apparently the Paralympic team is just thieves . Don t fucking boo that , you can t . I had an idea for doing a joke about the Olympics so offensive that I would have to retire . And then that Rebecca had letting things in the papers and I couldn t do it . I don t even think Rebecca had letting s ugly . She s a bit of a challenge wink . But I thought the real star of the Olympics obviously , Jessica and I straight . So my idea was when she d won the medal and she s up in the podium in the National Anthem s play and she s crying . I thought it d be good to tweet this joke . I couldn t go out with someone like Jessica and I said , couldn t go out with a woman who wouldn t feel it when I punched on this stomach . I d end up having to pay for an abortion . And there d be no coming back from that joke . </s> <s> I d had to go and live with Jimmy Carr on his private island . Bill Jimmy , man , Maxine Carr s raging that he s ruined the family s good name . You know what s at the heart of it for these papers ? They say , oh , we don t like this kind of comedy , you know . But they like to titillate the readers with the jokes . Oh , we shouldn t have said this . Don t fucking print it in . It s like a flash . I ve been up in front of a judge and the judge saying , you re accused of approaching a lady in a park and showing her . One of these . So we have time to be doing comedy , you know . It s the first time since I started when people have said , let s ban certain words , let s ban certain jokes . And language doesn t really work like that , you know . I had to be lying on the last tour about the Ministry of Defence . I m very anti war , so I was going to the Ministry of Defence . At least the old days we ve been honest , and we used to call it the Ministry of War . Hello , Ministry of War , Department of Negabombing . How can I help ? That actually comes from a quote from Lloyd George . Lloyd George , when he was British Prime Minister , he said , Britain reserves its right to bomb Niggas . And that s an important quote , because once you hear that , you realise that Britain s always been racist from the top down . I thought it s worth using that in a joke for . It s worth using that word for . Guy came up to me after a gig in Glasgow , a white guy . And he said , I don t think that you should ever use the word Niggor in any context . And I said , well , you ve just used it . And you know what he said , he said that I kind of hope I would say in his circumstances . No , didn t . She can t really ban words . Right , Ricky , your vase got in trouble for saying , I don t know why he did it , because he didn t seem to be able to make it very funny . He put ban on words . Even a horrible word like that . Let s just say , let s just ban one book . Let s just ban Mein Kampf . It s a horrible book . Nobody likes it . At the point you ban Mein Kampf , you re a fucking fascist society . And you re not even a proper fascist society . Because you ve burned the fucking gay book . You re marching about in peach military uniforms , invading pout lines . Find that you burned the guy book . Find that you burned the guy book , you fucking spastic . You can t call me that type of open purer . That verb has been banned . You must call me Diningampoop . I feel about like that by the Levinson inquiry . Right , obviously the tabloids are guns . Right , obviously . </s> <s> And it s all PR now . Right , I don t know if anything s even happening in Syria or if President Assad has just got a book coming out . But freedom and the press is important . And maybe the price that we pay for that is we have to hear who ranked Yx s Shagon . The only reason we held that was because his name fits really easily on Twitter . Jan Venegut of Hesselink can pump you fucking lights . Enjoy the Levinson inquiry . I like the mechanics on there . I kept wanting them to go , could you round it up in the next ten minutes mate ? We ve left the kids over in Starbucks . Just as sure they could still have a bout of a laugh . There is a place for mechanics jokes that s probably here . You can t see they should do them on the dictionary corner account down or something . And going into the break , I d like to remind you that Maddie is an anagram of I m Dead . Why didn t fucking kill her ? I left her with four hours of air . My can should lighten up , shouldn t they ? They re probably grandparents by now . I don t know , wait a minute , you can t . You can t do a joke while she s dead and then boo when mush is alive . Fucking penguin . She had another evil thing with Levinson , who leaves personal voicemail messages ? Who s ever done that ? I like to think if I d been famous enough to get phone high , what have I done ? Is there a God my friends to leave messages for me , claiming that I draped them . I was like one one father and got a really shit celebrity impressionist to do it . I literally fell in love with him . Why did you write me ? I pinn the fool it right me . Why do you gross me here ? Let s look at the evidence again . You handed me a drink and I woke up with my arsehole pishing . Blur . Why did you rape me ? John Fungos here , Mars , house , wait , boy . Marie Walker here , I ve been dead for years . Why did you rape my dead body ? What the fuck am I doing ? Some people say you should never joke about rape . I probably shouldn t have laughed through that , sure . Some people say you should never joke about rape . Rape can never be funny . To those people I say , imagine Pears Morgan being raped by Lyno from Thundercatch . Those are just what ifs . They re not real . Pears Morgan being raped by Lyno from Thundercatch , funny . At the school assembly of a disabled school , not funny . They don t blind so they can t see what s happening . </s> <s> Funny , funny . But they can smell something strong . The smell starts to turn them on , funny again . If it s just a question of your own personal taste , isn t it ? I m offended by banality . I d been a lot less offended by Michael Macintyles last DVD . If I d been raped with it . I was jade . J . Good day . Sorry mate , I only fucking jade I know . Don t be talking about it . Go for it . She s fucking been dead for about five years in my country . Are you just woken up from a fucking coma or something ? This was covered on my last release . Poor old jade man , fucking didn t like ending people , but then hadn t heard of the concept of karma . Shall passeti , you smell a curry ? Well , jade , you smell a lot fucking worse than curry now . I got asked to do a questionnaire for a newspaper and they refused to print it . I think because my answer to the first question , what s the most expensive thing you ve ever bought ? An apple , aureka Johnson s silence . So if you ever told someone you loved them and not meant it , an apple only my kids . What was the other one ? What would you do if you were invisible for the day ? So if I was invisible for the day , I think I d kick on my martyrs to death . So at least they d die if everyone was thinking it was fantastic . Or I d paint my coat to look like a jaffer mineral and hang around a bulimia seminar . So at least I went out case , yeah . I thought a sex tape , and maybe it was about to come out , but it turns out those little cameras in the windows are curries don t even record . Are you doing big monstrous guy with the tattoos , L Man ? You reviewing this for the digger ? Guys , as we re now outside for you to be connected for and I ll pack it a ham . Just L Man , what d you do ? I ve barely spent that . Bit of this and a bit of that . So it s like you might be figuring in Glasgow s security community somewhere between . I don t imagine you mean a bit of watercolour painting and a bit of pub watching . Are you doing baby or are you ? I m old enough to be old dad . Doesn t look like it s stocked him . I ll variable talk to you all . Are you doing my martial story ? Shall I hope for the future ? To be a stand up comedian . To be a stand up comedian . Why the fucking give it a try ? I know you ve all been raised on the fucking X factor and you think that s how it works . The great fuck off . There s no way that he s had the fucking abusive childhood necessary to do this job . What s your real fucking plan meant ? I make it fucking convincing this time or all . Try again in the ground like a fucking tent peg . See what happens . </s> <s> See what happens . You better get a fucking plan , son . You re gonna live in a Glasgow in a recession . You re gonna end up being the world s first ever male prostitute as to offer a mildew . A mouth asshole on a soft drink for 149 . Do you think I have any nectar points ? Hey , do me , man . You all right ? Just story where you re from ? What call ? Come on . Fucking rangers jokes aren t for ten minutes . Right , everybody . Tell you what you ve had in your face . You know when you go to toilet , you go for a shitting or no toilet paper . And you re looking in your pockets for something to use and all you find is a receipt . And just before you use it , you look at it and see that it s a receipt for toilet paper . What the fuck in dealing with here ? What d you do at my call , man ? Don t you fucking answer me . Fucking , nobody would fucking pay to see you in here , mate . The only way I d pay to see you if it was in a fucking downloadable snuff video . What are you doing , mate ? You work for Joan Lace . Fantastic . It s surprisingly camp occupation you ve got there . I ll take it . This is what you met him . How you doing ? Yeah , I sort of look of when a life s victim s about you , do you know that ? You look like you can enjoy screaming out your pin number as you re slowly folded into a sports hold up . Some old people , hello people . Don t worry , I m not your enemy . Winter is your enemy . Got wee boy now , is . Oh fuck , we ve got someone trying to contact the Starship Enterprises . That s a fucking turn up for the books . I ll tell you how you could encore that we performance pal . Why don t you fucking jump ? That s maybe a fucking laugh . We have wee boy now , he s four . He s the most important thing in the world to me , really , is . Especially now I ve heard that my kidneys might be on their way out . I m especially around the supermarket the other day , because . . . You done a poo ? You meant no , I ve done a potato . I ve done a potato , a bum potato . We are having someone in your life that you love that much , you know , because it teaches you about yourself . I was grew up thinking I was a freedom loving person . I bring my kids up without stifling them . Another day , I put my merry go round on a walletser , and as it went round , I walked round with it , so that at no point was out of my sight . So I thought , was this freedom loving person actually I m going ? This thing s a fucking sushi restaurant for Peter Files . </s> <s> We got the boy a dog , but it died . It s a good tip for you if you ve got a young dog yourself . Very important to adjust its collar as it grows . Apparently the average kid only gets to see his dad for an hour a day . My kids get to see me for six hours a day , for remembering to turn the TV to Dave before I go out . Life s different for kids now , isn t it ? I don t get handmade downs anymore . Now as a wee guy , ask my parents for an action man for Christmas , they gave me my sister s barbedo with a tits scraped off , what a hot knife . Do you have a fancy bar , baby man ? Do you ever make barbellies up with a wee knitted women off the toilet row ? I m a feminist basically , women don t eat men , do they ? What women need to do is to invent a vibrator that knows how to bleed their radios . There s beauty , that stuff they get pushed in , is sticking your feet in a tank full of fish and then the fish eat the dead skin . That s the coding , is what that is . That s one step above having your asshole peck cleaned by an eagle . You know what I did , the first boot job on , on a dog . I did it on a dog , didn t win crafts but it did come second in Miss Paisley in 1975 . Enjoy your daily volumes , swimming up the terms . I wish it slashes hamstrings and make him swim the fucking ganges . Actually took a tension away from that wee gange . You see the guy that swam a channel with no arms , no legs ? I thought he should have pulled himself out the other end and gone , shark . You can try the one , do you remember that guy ? Because you know he s not even allowed to train it , his local swimming baths . Because it s impossible for him to get in the water without bombing . Did anyone see what they did ? They finished lying down and see this ? The sarcastic bastards gave my standing ovation . You re two things you can t do , you re a poor fucker . You know you re fucking flesh egg . Look on the bright side , he never gets a bruca . Enjoy the trial of Michael Jackson s dog , da . We ll talk during the trial about exhuming Jackson s body to do tests on it . See if they ve done it , I was going to watch it on the news with the volume turned down and thriller on the stereo . Did you hear the tape ? They played a tape at Jackson s voice under sedation . </s> <s> Show him any drugs I was giving him and he s going . I m going to build the children s house blue . The biggest children s house blue in the world . Call it Michael Jackson s children s house blue . I don t even think it was his voice . I think it was the voice of the pedophile demon that controlled his soul . I m going to build the children s house blue . I m going to buy those kids a game of whack a mole . But I m going to lie under the game of whack a mole . Shake my cock up through it . So when they re buying it away with a little hammer , they re actually buying it my cock . Michael Jackson s children s house blue . The biggest children s house blue in the world . I m going to dress up as a surgeon . I m going to do operations on him . Put little cocks and little clitters into the palms of the hands . So when I m holding hands with them , I m actually abusing them in the mother fuckers . Michael Jackson s children s house blue . The biggest children s house blue in the world . I m going to tell them they ve been cured . I m going to tell them the role key and send them home to the mama . But it won t be the mama . It ll be me . I m going to stop as the mama and some Mrs . Doubtfire kind of make up . And they ll wake up on their first night home to hear me screaming , you re not okay . You re not okay . The mama s space has our common sight of . I m going to tell them the big children s house blue . The biggest children s house blue . You re sorry you booed the Shen and Matthew s joke . I got the clearest hekel I ve ever had in my life when I met it . Goes are eight , it was just a mad Michael Jackson find right and then to that bit , it goes , long after you and my memory has gone . Michael Jackson s memory will live on . And I said in the nightmares of his victims . Well this is the ugly end down here , how are you doing man ? Go look like Alan Schudel s come face . I tell her these story actually , she s always hard to go back into material after Michael Jackson s children s hospital . I remember they d take a deep breath and we ll find a happy place and I ll fucking . . . I ll tell her these story and then we ll fucking move along . People ask you , people ask you about good hekels , you know . Now almost never happens , you know that thing where a hekel destroyed a sense of a material . </s> <s> I saw it once , it was standing , glas go and a guy was doing a terrible routine , you know . Do you know that Bob Marley song , I Shot The Sheriff ? I shot The Sheriff , that s what you re saying , quote , is it Bob ? Well good luck , good luck with the judge if you re saying I shot The Sheriff . I m interested to see her that case , pants out and I m showing you the sheriff right . Eventually I get out of the front just fucking cracks and go is to be fair , he does go on to state that it was himself defence . Scottish people aren t even trying to be rude , aren t they ? I think that s what people have got to understand . You know , this girl came up to me a couple of weeks ago , you know that she wasn t even particularly trying to be rude . She would go come up to me and glas going she wanted a photo taken with me and she introduced herself with the words , you probably won t want to do this because you re a pure dick . And I didn t because I am a pure dick . So fucking dumbness is well , this is true as well . I found a taxi the other night and people can t hear thunder . I went out and I said to the guy , are you a taxi ? No , no , I am driving a taxi . So we ended the minute when this whole ranger was saying , man , half the people are delighted , half of them are miserable as fuck . It s like Glasgow has had a stroke . I like that whole antisectarian bell , do you remember that ? We re going to buy these songs , we re going to teach the police these songs , we re going to make her rest . So somewhere over the summer there was a classroom , Philabic Strathflight police officers who had to sit there for the day and pretend that they don t know this hash . Strathflight police , still the only job you can get with three old levels and I grade seven on the flute . I like to give it to both sides equally , man , the Pope . If I was ahead of an organisation with a rich history of Peter Foulier , I don t think I d drive about something that looks like a fucking ice cream van . Fuck the Queen , I m the Pope . Farsi . Tell you what Glasgow is like , this is true . I did that in the King s theatre before , right ? There s a wee guy down there where Rangers medallion , and I mean , fuck the Queen , I m the Pope , and he went , in that order . </s> <s> I m Rangers , man . Can I have ironic that the only guy that does do walking away is David Murray ? I won t be walking away this season because away games are 400 fucking miles away . I ve seen your team getting read out in Gaelic by daughter , man . If I had to summon Glasgow up to you , right ? It s a place where there s nothing you can say that s so mental that someone won t back you up , right ? I remember a few years ago I was trying to cut through a park with my baby , it was a baby at a time , he s crying , I m trying to get over the park to meet his mum , it s Christmas time , and obviously it s raining because it s Glasgow and it s fucking wetter than Whitney Houston s last joint . They do sell sunglasses in Glasgow , but only to victims of domestic abuse . And then guys steps out in front of us and goes , you can t come through here , I m astured for a Christian organisation , and we re filming an activity scene here . And I said , so you tell me , because you re doing an activity scene , there s no room for me and my baby . And I pushed past and I said something I m still quite proud of to this day , I said , Jesus , what the fuck in hate to do ? And I walked out through the activity scene , they were all turning around and I m going fuck off , fuck you , and I m just like that , just as the Virgin Mary turned around , which almost makes me work become a Catholic again so I can confess that I did someone in 27 years since my last confession , gave her a lid of finger , still nothing compared to what God did , till the doctor passed up . I get to the other end of the park , and I see my pal Gary , and I haven t seen my pal Gary at this point for 18 months , which I remember because he s been in jail . Because I m telling you , Gary , I m losing it , man , I m losing my fucking mind . I almost punched a Christian , and Gary s first lutz after all that time , I can hold the baby . We have gay weddings in Scotland now , I m prouder at man , I m prouder Scotland , because we ve got nothing against gay people , have we ? Unless by gay , you mean English . I remember I was drinking in a really rough public class , we re cross years ago , and there s only two old guys in a pub , and an English guy comes in and tries to order a pint of lark of tops , and this old guy here looks up at me and goes , you sell your ass . </s> <s> And the other old guy , who s even with him ? Goes , and it s a raffle . Who would have thought that the crankies were swingles by the way ? I like to think that if I was at a swingles party in my car , keys come out the bowl when the crankies stood up , I d go and fuck it , you can keep the car . So I ll be quick real or something , here s a real or something . How to tell if your partners have an affair ? They seem happy . My girlfriend likes sex outdoors , and I really don t . So what we ve done is we ve compromised and taken a spring off the letterbox . We did a study that love produces the same effects as cocaine . Certainly whenever I make love , it usually involves the death of an orphaned Colombian street child . So I think , isn t there , would a guy put a condom on before sex ? Obviously before sex . I m off to the pictures . If a guy puts a condom on without being asked , I mean , you know , on a one night stand , the women laugh and think , well , that s great gentlemanly . Great gentlemanly of him . Resort from the reason he s put that condom on is it he s looked at you and thought , bit of a skank . How come teenagers need to get so wasted now ? Used to be a fucker teenager , I had to get them drunk . Now there s , I ve got to sober them up . Do you have any idea how difficult it is to penetrate someone in their recovery position ? You know , I ve time limit a set of some of my love making . Tear an ambulance side and go off in the background . So let s try to come to the fucking countdown music . Sometimes the ambulance crew run out and defibrillate their body and the electricity will search through them . And as I come , my cock feels like Roul Moe s dying moments . Why do you let me do this ambulance crew ? We work for Michael Jackson s children . You look like a fucking junkie or something , you know that man ? You re fucking nodding out there . Okay pal , just worry . And you fucking know who I m talking to is what you do , look like a junkie . Hey , do you mind what s your story , would you do it ? Nothing yet . There s a fucking sentence loaded with promise . I was like a fucking stage magician , you re seeing nothing yet . What s your plans man ? What you working on at the moment ? What you re going to fucking reveal ? You re in the army ? You re trying to join the army ? I ve seen nothing yet , I reckon soon I could see you ve been blown to fucking pieces for my entire reason . </s> <s> I don t know , that s a future , do you know what I mean ? How you doing down here ? You look kind of normal for this crowd , you re right man . What s your story man ? Nothing . You think I can t break you ? Look , millions just do stock put down lines , I have a private detective who rapes people . I mean I ll take the rickshaw himself so he can forget about you afterwards . Hey from my coat bridge . He s so much more to play a cast close to your chest there . Fantastic . So who s your key worker ? Can you do a coat bridge ? You working a factory ? What are they making there ? Disposable , blood units . Disposable ? Blood units ? The fuck is a blood unit ? A bag full of blood . Did you fucking life put any bleaker ? He s Christ man , I wouldn t sentence a sex if I had that 11 in coat bridge back in up blood . Can you get it some ? What about you ? What do you do ? Does he just say he s bagging out blood and he s actually a fucking sex killer ? Can I hand back from the blood factory ? No , the factory said I need to burn all these clothes again . Company policy . What do you do man ? You ve just finished college , what did you do at college ? Hospitality and business . What a fucking pointless endeavor that was . Fucking Scotland , anyone who comes to hotel here doesn t expect hospitality . Then he s a fucking roomie prick . What about you man ? It s just a story by the . . . You re a student when you study . . . Engineering . Engineering , what did you hope to build ? Done . You don t know . Fucking pointer that in man ! That s some fucking ambition man . How at least the ambition is fucking flatten coat bridge man . Flatten its fucking bogus fucking mutter factories . Fucking replace the whole thing where we sign it just says we re sorry . It s actually different for young people now isn t it ? It s more extreme . They got brought up on broad bands , you know what I mean ? My son when he grows up , he ll come home one night and go , Dad , Dad , I got to first base tonight . An interracial cream pie . Second base will be smash and up perineum in what a fucking fire extinguisher . See if we can out in a bedroom , a house party going smell my first . What s someone to explain to me when I was a wee guy ? I always thought getting a woman off would have a kind of light touch to it . </s> <s> Now can I save cracker ? Can I hang ? I wish someone had explained exactly how much it s like sand in a fucking banister . Whatever we prank it . Think more like your trigger , I d been a stain out of a deep carpet . I got asked to do celebrity big brother this year , what a fucking blood bath that would have been man . Was people aren t celebrities ? Is there a group of people you d have to hire a private detective to connect to Kevin Bacon ? They sent me a DVD the guy , why not the DVD was which he called ? Fucking Paddy from Juxi Weddings . Probably because they worked out how hard it would be to evict a cunt . He better judge . Well , that s a theory bit judge , that the egg that s split to form them is actually trying to destroy itself . Is that sign up right , man ? Right , this is true . Next week , fun run for the disabled . How fucking sick is that ? How sure is money for the disabled ? Let s show them what fun it is running . Now what fun you could have running if only you weren t disabled . Climb in a nice spike or a test for the fucking blind ? Something beginning with n , nothing . There s a real taboo about disability now , you know , you re not supposed to talk about it at all . Disabled people are stereotyped , there s other vulnerable . The most vulnerable people in society , the weakest people in society , and they re not just ordinary everyday people like everyone else . My pal at uni , she had brittle bones , so she was a wheeler , saying a wheelchair . She was vulnerable , she was the harshest , drunkest , most cock hungry motherfucker . She was vulnerable in certain situations , right ? She d thrown a bouncy ball in a small enough room , she d a fucking kill herself . She was vulnerable . Now I feel about like this about the Paralympics . I d rather watch the Paralympics than the Olympics , because there s a narrative to it . People are transcending something . There s more of value in the Paralympics . At the same time , there is an irony to celebrating physical disability by getting people to do some of the only things that they can t fucking do . So let s celebrate mental handicap with a giant episode of Mastermind , in which modern country is the ancient city of Babylon . My name is David . You passed on 25 questions , and your name is not David . How does the dive in work at the Paralympics , do some people just get thrown in ? Oh , a skim there is going to get points for that . Also , surely the silver lining , I ve been disabled , you don t have to do fucking sports anymore . I strict with our P teachers , rather than do five of sides today , I lost my legs in a train crash . Fucking change boy ! You re your shin pads to someone else . Well , she s been heartening . </s> <s> Prince Andrew , turned out to have a pal who was a pedophile bill , you know . I didn t realise I was a pedophile bill , you know . I got fobbed off while I packed up fruit pastels . So we ll barely scone him , had to stand in , he was accused of my other things , shagging teenage prostitutes . It s 76 , when he comes it must put a hand for a sand thrown in your eyes . That s what I have now , who for bag , tiptoe via head . Greece is going to touch up , everything s for sale in Greece . I m buying Lesbos because I ve had a great idea for a theme park . But it was going to touch up , teachers might have to work till the 70 . Why do you want a 70 year old maths teacher s going to be like , if there are two milk bottles on my doorstep and they re joined by a further 12 milk bottles , how long have I been dead ? You re right , finding yourself out there , fucking hot , isn t it ? I m sweating up here like fucking Peter Andre on count down . It s always vaguely sinister when it s hot outside in Scotland , doesn t it ? Somebody s left something on . Did you enjoy the rites ? That s for a good fucking laugh , aren t they ? So is he just how right wing all the commentators in this country are ? Are these people at right of columns going , oh , should we go into Libya ? Is it okay to do something about Syria when it s here ? They re like , should this prick , he s got a pair of sannies ? Fucking hell up ! Are they pay per tundin at the daily mail ? Fuck knows what the daily mail is writing ? Princess Diana s body has been stolen by space packers . We need to be more honest about how we react to things . People react to things in complex ways . I m encouraged now to pretend that we only react in simple ways . So for example , do you remember the case ? There was a wee guy on a school trip , got killed by a polar bear . Now obviously you watch that in the news , you know , that s terrible for the wee guy , terrible for his friends , his friends , so on that . Obviously you think that . But also , part of me . Part of me thought , ha ha . What ? But can I have ironically went to a school called Eaton ? Better approach , all of you , if you get killed by a polar bear really . Look at that , I ve got for center parks . Just a picture of the bear biting down on someone s head and underneath . Center parks , shite , but there s no polar bears . I felt a bit like that , but do you remember the case ? There was a Scottish lass in Afghanistan , a hostage , and the Americans were supposed to rescue her and they blew her up . Blow her up . Who would have imagined that a rescue grenade wouldn t work ? It s not a rescue grenade , I ve got a really good feeling about this . </s> <s> They found the whole thing , so at least a family will get compensation . 250 pounds from you ve been framed . I m sure Sam I ve been ladding the face and through him in the sea . In my favourite episode of Celebrity Wipeout . Prince Harry s going to Afghanistan . So now he might die for the same reason as his mum . Fucking with their own Muslim . Can he die anyway ? He s had ginger in the desert . Can you get a skin cancer from a fucking crescent moon ? Do you want to just give soldiers in Afghanistan ? Bumproof pants . It s got to really take the edge off if you re hearing that your son s died in a mortar attack who s presented with his perfectly preserved cock and balls . But a bit politely disengaged in Scotland at the minute , aren t we ? We think that NATO is just a nickname you give to a guy who lost a foot to diabetes . I don t know if that s terrible or not , but it s just my favourite fucking joke . We cause the world s problems , you know what I mean ? We don t even cause them , we don t even have agency . We re just like America s evil henchmen . You know , we torture people because we think they re suicide bombers . The guy was planning on blowing himself up . What the fuck are you going to do to him ? He s a Muslim getting a picard and coke , he ll tell you everything . Terrorists are fucking overrated , they re fucking morons . That guy in Norway , my plan for white supremacy , step one , kill 68 white people . White supremacy , what kind of a fucking position is that ? I went to live in a world where white people range supreme . You already do , you stupid cunt ! You re ready fucking dooo ! You just made yourself sent to jail that s run by black people ! That s where the white people belong , because the fucking race is cunt ! You have loved you ! 30 years since the Falcons were ? 30 years and yet Simon Weston doesn t seem to have aged a day , does he ? I think he d laugh at that joke ! If this face could still move . . . Scotland just . . . Scotland just got voted the manliest nation on earth . I think it s the women of Scotland that won us that world . Most guys think I ve ever seen . We got lost in the West Hill in May , went to his pub , it s like a really old pub , and it s got timbers going across the ceilings , you re going to the lounge bar . And this big rugby player guy in a Scotland rugby top walks through , we have three of drinks , and he walks bang ! The face first in one of these timbers doesn t spill a drink , takes a step back and goes . </s> <s> . . Fuck you , beam ! I think English people have a stereotype , I don t know , we get hard to understand as we get drunker . I ve always found the opposite , it s true . I ve been to meet Simon at the start of the night and I m like . . . Then you see them after like eight drinks and a doorway on their phone going . . . I don t see any reason why I shouldn t be allowed to speak to my own wife ! We re going to do it if I m wearing that Brad Pitt thing in Glasgow , thousands of people down there , mostly locals hoping to be adopted . The furthest streets with zombies just by suspending the method on programme for two weeks . I like Andy Murrayman , Andy Murray s not even miserable , is he ? That s just what a Scottish guy looks like when he s never allowed to eat chips . It s a different fucking world out there , isn t it , man ? You see a kid with stabilizers on his bike in Glasgow , doesn t mean he can t cycle . Sometimes it means he needs to be able to do his paper round drunk . David Cameron left his kid in the pub . I like to think I d realise I left my kid in the pub at the point where I was strapping my bodyguard and he had boosted his seat . Never see Scottish kids in the pub do you ? Well , not since they re smoking , man . Cameron s behind in the pose to Ed Miliband . What must that feel like ? I must be hearing that your wife s left you for a download . Don t even think that any Milibands like finding a toilet so dirty , you d rather just shit your pants . Fucking people who have elected over the last few years , man . Limba Opec , a fucking banana with Down syndrome . Boris Johnson , a guy who always looks like he s just broken a hotel trowzer , trying to reheat a meat pie . We got a father and father away from democracy in this country . What we call democracy has got father and father away from reality . So now as a kid , thatcher was in . So I didn t vote for this . Most people did vote for it . She s doing exactly what she said she was going to do . Deep throat and Satan s cock so hard . She could lick his black balls on the downstroke . And then he was later laboring around and you think , well , I voted for this , but I m not doing what they said they would do . And now we re the quads , shouldn t you think ? Well , nobody voted for this . Nobody voted for the fucking cuss . And if you re a liberal Democrat voter , they ll do exactly the opposite of what they said they were going to do . The leadingist by stages , the leadingist by stages to the next general election . </s> <s> You went to a polling booth , you confronted by a piece of paper which drawings a four different desserts on it . You ll tick the one you like least and you ll get raped by a clown . And you ll think the clown s going to come inside you , but at the last minute it ll pull out and it ll be confetti . The fucking moral people , that s the problem . They don t moral . You know , that lets withdraw benefits to encourage people back in work . With those no jobs , that lets with draw medicine to encourage people to become fucking immortal . Without coaching free fall , that s what I ll just switch your TV on , man . Have you seen that show where they get heavily disabled people to go on dates ? What s it called ? The only way is Essex . And that s the role models now . If you re a young woman , that s what you aspire to . To be fired into more often than fucking Tupac . The voice , I watched one episode of The Voice and my cringy flecks got such a workout . I can now clench my face into a fist . JCJ , to me , looks like a flightless bird that somehow gets its head stuck in a chemotherapy wake . She came out as bisexual , brilliant . Now , women cannot fancy her as well . Fucking zombie culture , do you know what I mean ? Anyone who makes money will just never retire . Madonna , I ll keep getting off pets out . Madonna s tits look like the kind of things you d buy in a pet shop for dogs to choose a treat . Blur , blur , a fucking cheese making cunt , a new labour cunt . A fake cunt , a cunt . So I get one final sweep on the Death Star . I m doing a show on Channel 4 . Channel 4 , a channel so cynical that they ll probably rebrand the Paralympics in Baris and Body Sports Day . They haven t stood still over the years . They invented E4 for morons and E4 plus 1 for morons who can t tell the time . Purod Whitney Houston . It was only the other day that the grief really hit me when Ladbrok s explained that for my cumulator to pay out , Gaza would have had to have died first . Her family said at least she was clean when she died . And she must have been , she d been in the bathroom out . Steve Jobs died . Anyone else think it was ironic that Steve Jobs got thinner as his laptop s got thinner ? That s about the time he invented the Macbook Air . He was a ghost . I came up with a use for the iPad . I had iPads for taking a piss out of fat people . We do a sitting train and you wait for a fat person at the sit side and then you go , excuse me , I think I left my iPhone on that chair . </s> <s> Are you squashed at your fat cunts ? I did a great thing the other day . I said that the Wi Fi signal from laptops might damage sperm . Now to be honest , I ve been checking my sperm on the laptops on and it seems to be fine . If anything it s a laptop they get damaged . I know of a filled toasting . And that was suddenly too much , uniform and strange crowds . I ve always had this talent to say it s a kind of reflex to say the most horrible thing possible . Remember when I was a teacher ? That was a teacher . A wee guy in class put his hand up . I think he was trying to embarrass me . And he went , so see for my story I need a euphemism for erection . And I said , rapist crowbar . It s a curse , it is a curse , you know . I mean , out there is a squirrel for years . We were in love , we were both in love , we lived together all that stuff . And then years later I saw her in a railway station . I m talking for five minutes and it s one of those things we are talking for five minutes . It s like you ve never been apart . And I should have left , she turned around and she said , do you ever think of me ? And I said , to stop myself from coming . So it s a curse , you know , and I get a lot of hate . No one could ever hate me half as much as I don t care . It s good to be hated by morons . It s good to wake up in the morning knowing that there s people out there that have danced some grave . But if I get buried , it s see the little fucking drown . It was a last one . I was doing some jokes about Robby Savage . And he got annoyed and he wanted to fight me , to eat me , went to fight me . And I was like , you keep fighting evolution and I ll fight the winner . Can we bet trouble with Jordan last year ? No . I don t create the culture . I just comment on the culture and if the culture throws up a big titted subject abuse victim , they only know about how disabled kid because he turns up in her publicity , how do I fucking joke about him ? I can prove the jokes for him that Jordan , because there s no way that Harvey was watching that fucking show . People said , oh , Harvey will get bullied at school because of that joke . Did you literally tell me there are kids at school that Harvey would like to bully him , but can t think of an angle ? </s> <s> So I don t have any lighthearted joke about Jordan , lighting things up . What s the difference between Jordan and a pair of curtains ? Nothing they both make the world a darker place . She did a paper yesterday saying she s a marmic personality . She is because half the country hates some of the other half thinks she belongs on the end of a fucking knife . And the world Thompson get done for nicking cheese . Five times they filmed him before the police turned up . They re all up quicker if it was fucking angely harry . I ll let you lay there where you worked out if I was racist the night it wasn t fuck off . I m feeling for nicking cheese . Maybe if they re coming up in the morning , find them what is neck broken and a giant mouse trap . Probably that ginger beard thing . Have you ever heard this that this is a viking thing ? The idea would be that there was no native British ginger beard . So this would have come from the vikings . I think I m not that athletic . Because almost by definition my great great great great granny couldn t run very first . If you think about it if you go far back along enough any virginetic lines , we re all at some point the product of rape . With me is my dad . I say my dad it could be anyone I cam around 1982 World Cup Squad . You all right lady with a pink hair ? You okay ? You haven t smiled on it . You okay ? It s good to be doing fucked off on you . I ll talk about one last thing because after I talk about this it s kind of too horrible to talk about anything else . The last thing I want to talk about is do you remember the case recently when you guys in Rochdale operating out of a bald to house ? For one of a better phrase they were fucking kids . Now I thought the way that that case was reported on was racist . Right ? Because papers implied this but also people come and said this David Stark said this . This is cultural for these guys . Fuck out to do it their culture . The guys were from Pakistan . They consent that we do it . Fuck out to do it their culture . And the way that I was reported on was racist . Because white people do that . And when white people do it it doesn t make the papers . Because the football teams they play for fucking cover it up . I d actually quite like to eat in that bald house . At least you know they re not coming in the food . I think it d be a good episode of Ramsey s Kitchen Nightmares . You re raping and you re cooking in the same place . You need to separate , you re raping and you re cooking . What s wrong with this sauce ? </s> <s> You fucked the kids in there ! You fucked the kids ! You re talking to your guys with TK or sales at best ? Thank you . </s>"

        "transcript": "<s> Good , right , well , I m Jimmy Carves and my jokes . Let s not fuck about . Before you started , who s seen me before ? Who s never seen me before ? You sound happier . I m not entirely sure this is working . According to Offcom , the people that make the gullig lines for television , according to Offcom , the most offensive words on TV are the F word and the C word . But I m live on stage this evening , so I can say whatever the fuck I like . And those cunts can t do anything about it . I trouble getting out tonight . I had to organise a babysitter . I don t have children . I just found the rot cheaper than escorts . She s 17 . There s nothing she won t do for 50 pounds . It s sort of half a joke , that isn t it , because it s quite funny , but also true . When I m away from home , I sometimes get love sick . Wow , they call it Climidia . I spend a lot of my time away from home , because this is my job . I travel around the country telling jokes to people . I love it . I spend a lot of my time away staying in hotels , because I have to travel . I was in a hotel a couple of weeks ago , walked into the hotel room . As I walked in there , just on the TV it said , the adult channel is disabled . I thought that s a bit specialist . I m joking . I was gutted , no spars porn . I m sure you ve all seen this , Birmingham . On trains , they ve got seats reserved for elderly disabled and pregnant people . Begs the question , who s fucking all these old cripples ? Do you hear anything so dumb , it s almost brilliant . It just takes you a moment to work out what just happened . I ll give you an example . I was on a bus . I heard this girl get on the bus , walk up to the driver and go , can I get a return ? I m the driver , where to ? And she went back here . It took me like an extra beat . What s going on ? Oh , she s a fucking idiot . Case closed . People worry about their physical appearance . We ve all got silly hang ups . Personally , I m worried that one of my balls is bigger than the other two . I shaved my testicles . I called them Brazil nuts . Thanks me , Giggle . Because it tickles when I do it . The first few weeks are joining Weight Watchers . You re just finding your feet . Well done . All together all not at all on the laugh , I think . Feed line , punch line , laugh . Don t fuck about . You re getting it late nonsense . Are there any ginger people in tonight ? We ve got any ginger people ? I think we ve contained the problem there . Ginger people get given a hard time . People say very unkind things about ginger , but I think you should be destroyed humanely . </s> <s> I can talk , check out the look I m rocking . Look like a Lego Hitler . That s his style . When I broke up with my last girlfriend , I said , I blame myself . I should never have let you let yourself go . But you have , so you have to fuck off . Do you read the Sunday papers ? Do you read the Sunday papers ? I like the papers on a Sunday morning . It s a nice time to reflect on the last week and also to look ahead for the next week . We read the Sunday papers like the news world . In bed , Sunday morning , a couple of weeks ago , Tito s Sunday papers . What could be nicer ? What could be more British ? My girlfriend turns to me . There s some sex scandal in the news of the world as they re in very ble is . My girlfriend turned to me and went , I hope you ll never find out you re having an affair . I said , me too . You could be the moral arbiter on this one Birmingham . You d be the moral arbiter on this one this evening . I ve got a friend . He got dumped by his girlfriend . She ended their relationship just because he said something . They were making love . They were mid coitists . Fucking . As he orgasmed , as he arrived , ejaculated came , most intimate , but also the most vulnerable time for a man . As that occurred , as he . . . He said , bang and the dirt is gone . I can see two distinct groups of men . There s someone looking at me as if to say , I don t know that s that bad . I think maybe she s overreacted a little bit . And then I can see other men looking at me as if to say , note to self . You ve got to be very careful with jokes in the bedroom , because it s quite funny to say to a girl who s sucking you off . It s rude to talk with your mouth full . But it s even funnier if she says , well , it s not full . Having sex with someone at work is all right . As long as you don t work in a primary school . I ve got a friend who s a part time teacher . They re all part time . Are there teachers in ? Come on , it s your own time , you re wasting . Where are the teachers ? Give us a shout , the teachers ? And what was in the first to attract you to children ? Not all teachers , obviously , that would be mental , but PE teachers , they re wrong uns . You know what PE is short for ? Pido . It s a fact . You can load that up . You know why so many American kids die in high school massacres ? It s because they re not allowed to run in the corridors . Take your time without that wrong on a number of levels . It s very difficult to get the first kiss right . You want to be firm , but gentle . You want to be manly , but you don t want to wake her up . First dates are very delicate . </s> <s> Is anyone on a first date this evening ? Is anyone on a first date now ? On your own ? Seems a little bit suspect , doesn t it ? We re going somewhere very special . Sorry , I realised women don t masturbate . You just expect us to believe you really enjoy baths . Well , my first date is a very special one . Well , my first date is a delicate one . If you call her the next day , she ll think you re too keen to be part of . If you never phone , she ll think the worst of you . So what I do is a compromise is I phone her the next day and call her a slack . Sometimes you can sense a friend wants to take things further . Will it ruin the friendship ? Things get hot and heavy on the sofa one night , you think ? This doesn t feel right . You re my best friend . You re not even allowed on the couch . Bad dog , down boy . Did I say down boy ? I ve made it gay . I fucked a girl with one leg . Should I use my cock ? Should I use my cock ? Well , I realised this joke does not require a mind . It s a saturday night in Birmingham , come on . I said to my girlfriend , I said , I said , you want to experiment with a role play rape fantasy ? She said , no ! I said , that s the spirit . That s the spirit . Rap is such a horrible word though . It s such a harsh , brutal , awful word . That s why I prefer to call it a struggle snuggle . You couldn t stay mad at a struggle snuggle , is good you ? Bloody adorable . Now I ve been a comedian now for about 10 years . I ve been doing this job for about 10 years and I thought this year , I would try and get a bit better . Not a crazy idea , right ? One of the things I was quite weak on was regional accents . Is anyone here good at regional accents ? You could barely say the word yes there , so . . . We re not even good at talking , never mind accents . But I was no good at doing regional accents . And it s one of those things that as a comedian , it s quite good if you could be good at regional accents , because you re good for telling jokes . But I thought , well , I ll go a while , do some research . This evening I would like to give you a masterclass in regional accents , because I ve discovered the secret and the secret is this . All you need is a key phrase to get you started in the regional dialect , and then you re golden . Once you get started , once you get it in your head , you re fine . But getting started can be tricky . So I ll kick off with . . . What , I ll kick off with Scouse . Any Scouse was in ? We ve got Scouse over there , where s the Scouse ? </s> <s> I ll give it to Shout . No more , we re not going to take your benefits away . That is good . This is the phrase I use to do the Scouse accent , this is the phrase I have in my head to get me started in the Scouse .

Once you get started , then you could say something properly , authentically scouts . Autumn Chichen and Aghanaghoch . I m going on the rob . I ve got to get a presie . It s me , Grans , birthday . She s 30 . Anyone in from Belfast ? Anyone from Belfast ? Hey , Belfast . This is the phrase I used to get the Belfast accent right . Ginger and Cammuina Day . The terrifying stare is optional . But I only find it helps . Ginger and Cammuina Day . Cammuina Day has more syllables than you thought it had . Okay , let s try everyone . Let s go Belfast . Ginger and Cammuina Day . One , two , three . Jamey and Mamey . Perfect . You re now all qualified to say there s a bomb in the car . Rollercoaster , pooper scooper , umpulumper , Kawasaki . Four unrelated words , meaningless . In all respects , other than if you re trying to do the Jordy accent . Which case they re a fucking gift . All together . Kawasaki . Perfect . Are there any Jordies in ? No , presumably they re outside with their shirts off fighting . But I wonder what the fellas are up to . Well , should we go on a Welsh people in ? Yeah ! My god , we ve got an army . Hello , the Welsh . Now , I ve discovered the secrets of the Welsh accent . It isn t so much a phrase , it s more a state of mind . Did you have a good Welsh accent ? You ve just got a sound . Confused . Who s caught is that jacket ? Who s shoes are those trainers ? That s all right . Who s caught is that jacket ? </s> <s> Who s that ? Who s shoes are those trainers ? Who s that ? Perfect . See those two houses , the one in the middle is mine . That paper you re sitting on , are you reading that ? I came out to the shop and there was my bike . Gone . Anyone from Manchester ? No one from Manchester . Manchester s the accent s pretty easy for Manchester . You just need three words . Side . All right . Not bad . She wanted my best friend , the Manchester . He was named after where he was conceived . Any Scottish people ? Hello ? You re living the stereotype , aren t you , love ? Obviously , the Scottish accent is probably the best phrase to use is , there s been a murder . The chances aren t , they re probably fucking has been . Of course , living in Scotland , the main benefits are unemployment and housing . See the scouts as ears are perked up ? Like a chaffy mere count . There is a bit of a drink problem in Scotland , I hope you don t mind me saying . Yeah , up there they think I m a double act . And the drunks , you wouldn t believe the fucking drugs , whereabouts in Scotland are you from ? Fort William , I don t know what the fuck that is . What , what , sorry ? I forgot , I forgot . You ve got sort of where an accent meets your speech impediment , I think . The Loch Ness Monster . Are you introducing yourself ? Sorry . I mean it . Sorry . But the drugs in Scotland , I ve been in Scotland , they re called a methadone , it s called a Campbell , if it s not heroin . The easiest accent in the UK is the West Country , because the West Country is just a pirate voice , isn t it ? Who can t do a fucking pirate voice ? Ah . I m going on a date . With my sister . Oh , my mummy doesn t find out . I m Keaton , hon . Are there people in from the West Country ? Hey there , alright . Alright , hello . Not being patronising , I just thought it would be a little treat for you to see a hand with five fingers . Now what would be the phrase , if I was going to try and do the Birmingham accent ? What would be the phrase for Birmingham ? What would be the thing if I was going to . . . Alright . Alright . The other phrase that seems to come up a lot in Birmingham is , it s fucking shit here . Alright , it s fucking shit here . Any other phrases for Birmingham or what other ? What was that ? That was just all vowels . What was it ? A yawal . A yawal , alright . A yawal . A yawal . Are you at a stroke ? I said I shouldn t really joke about strokes if I ever stroke . I ll be laughing out on the other side of me face .

People drowned and you wouldn t have expected that because they were all wearing hats with corks on . Any others ? What was that one ? Chinese . You re Chinese .

Well that took you a long time , didn t it ? Oh no , got it . Any others ? Jamaican . Jamaican . You know my name is . You re wearing this ? Oh well this will be a treat for you . </s> <s> I m like everyone in the room now to say my name in a Jamaican accent . One , two , three . I am Jamaica . I m just like , yay ! Bomba Clark .

It s my favourite , do you want to hear my favourite Irish joke ? Maybe only Irish people get this joke , I ll tell you and see . What s the difference between a riot and a gypsy wedding ? You can t buy a gate at a riot . Maybe that s just an Irish thing , eh . Well , we ll move on . Every year in my show I write some jokes that require a visual element to be fully enjoyed , and this year is no exception . So what I thought I d do now is show you some of the pictures I ve done to illustrate the next jokes . Do you want to see them ? Excellent news , because that is what happens next . I ve had some ideas , I ll kick off with some ideas . I ve had an idea for a raper arm , that when you press it it plays the Benny Hill theme music . You know , to make it more of a caper . Some advice for you , the best way to test the temperature of a bath is with a baby s elbow . I ve had an idea of how to prop up our currency to pound against the euro and the dollar . What we do is we print new pounds and this time the queen is smiling . And if things get really bad , tits out your majesty . Little joke for you , what d you get if you crossed the queen and Prince Philip ? Killed in a tunnel . Too soon . It s been 14 years , get over it . All right , point taken , I ll drop that from the raw variety . I ll say that , Prince Philip , have probably pissed himself . Although he s 82 , he ll probably piss himself anyway . Some thoughts for you . When you think about it , a rhino is just a unicorn that did moisturise . Gillette claims to be the best a man can get . What about a blowjob from twins ? What ever happened to Jedwood ? Oh ! The speed men shave in adverts , if I shaved at that kind of speed , my balls would be in shreds . When I was told I was bipolar , I didn t know whether to laugh or cry . Friend of mine s got OCD for those of you that don t know OCD is an abbreviation . </s> <s> It s just a shorter , quicker way of saying I d be a really annoying girlfriend . True story . If all the veins in your body were laid out in a straight line , you would die . Let s talk about some social issues . My neighbour is noisy and nosy . He s always banging on the walls , shouting , He s anyone there , I ve fallen , anyone there . It s none of your business if anyone s here . Still , he s gone quite now . Childhood is now effectively over by 11 , which is when the pub s close and Uncle Terry gets home . Oh , Uncle Terry . I was traumatised as a child . Our priest was cheating on me . I just want to reach out to people that attempt suicide and say , Come on , have another go . Keys to the city , that s a weird thing , isn t it the keys to the city ? Of course , they don t have that in Liverpool , do they ? You just get given a co hanger . As a fashion statement , socks with sandals says , I mean that a German , a pedophile or a cunt ? Quite possibly , all three . Apologies to any pedophiles or cunts we have in . It s not going to be any Germans at a comedy gig . Health , let s talk about health , that s important , isn t it ? I heard that because of women putting on so much weight during pregnancy , it s a good idea to take off your wedding ring . So I did .

Now you ll notice that a deference and respect to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . I ll let him , by me . I ve got a Muslim friend who s really religious . Feel the tension in the room . I ve got a Muslim friend who s really religious , he knows the Quran backwards , which is handy , because that s how you read it . Surprisingly well informed and inoffensive joke about the Islamic faith . That s because I m not a fucking idiot . What are the Christians going to do ? Forgive me . Good luck with that . Speaking of Christians , any Catholics in ? A few Catholics , Catholics are a weird bunch . Look at the rosary , basically , anal beads . Excellent .

That d be great to get , but you can t just start doing that on TV , like day one , that d be tricky . So what I thought I would do on this tour is practice . Get someone out of the audience every night with an interesting job or a claim to fame , or go to your hands , go on straight up , what do you do ? You were on TV in Poland . I will take that to mean you work in the adult film business . So you ve been on Polish TV , okay , well that adds a claim to fame , well done , you . And Polish radio , well , finally .

I think we should talk to the funeral director . The funeral director ? What are the chances of you getting down here ? Don t fucking jump or I have to bury you . If you can make your way down to here , then we could talk to the funeral director . </s> <s> That sounds exciting . While he s making his way down , give him a smother . He s making his way .

LAUGHTER My ex girlfriend bought me the Karma Sutra last year as a gift , which put me in a very awkward position . </s> <s> LAUGHTER I d like to talk about a sex act that I don t fully understand . Are you all familiar with the 69 , yes ? No , I like the 69 as much as the next man . I hope he isn t , man . That d be terrible . I like the 69 , but I don t really understand it because it s an incredibly intimate thing to do with another human being . But how does the 69 ever occur ? Only ever happens when the man says to the woman , would you do that thing that I like ? And the woman goes , you re right , but only if you do that thing that I like . The man goes , not a problem , or where you go . And the woman says , no , because the last time I did the thing that you liked , you were a little bit sleepy afterwards . LAUGHTER You fucked off to sleep . You said we ll call it a 68 . It s like a 69 by 0 , you want . LAUGHTER I like everything about the 69 apart from the view . LAUGHTER The perineum or taint . I like to call it the Amanda Holden . Because like a Amanda Holden , on Britain s Got Talent last year , it s a bit between the arsehole and the cunt . LAUGHTER He is fucking Morgan . He s interviewing people now . When I said I wanted Peer s Morgan to get Parkinson s , I didn t mean he s fucking job . LAUGHTER LAUGHTER You shaking your head at a Parkinson s joke . That s inappropriate . LAUGHTER Right , let s try some rude stuff , see what we get along . Lady Wind . Queefing . Fanny Farts . The expulsion of air from the Vajay J during sexual intercourse . LAUGHTER A cunt grunt . LAUGHTER There are two main responses when a queef occurs . Some couples , it doesn t matter how gnarly or squalchy the noise . They deny the queef . Do you do anything ? No , I didn t hear anything . And they move on . Some couples , it s a funny little noise , they have a little giggle , they move on . Not a problem . I like to go a third way . I like to pretend that Vajayna is talking to me . LAUGHTER What s that ? There s a boy trapped down a well . I like to think of myself as the Vajayna whisperer . LAUGHTER What happened ? Do you get in the phone call ? Is the scotch lady getting a phone call ? I imagine the drugs are arriving any moment . LAUGHTER All right . You switched it off and it rang anyway . Well , I m not buying that fucking story . Don t worry , it s okay . Is any of your phone don t feel bad ? It s a what , sorry . It s a late alarm to come and see me . Or come and see me and I are fucking late . LAUGHTER You re not the one I booked for the interval , I ya . LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER It s very difficult to get dirty talk right . If you notice this , it s very difficult to get dirty talk right . </s> <s> Like in a long term relationship , it s fine . Because you know where your boundaries are , you know your partner . But on a one night stand , fraught with danger . I ve got a story concerning a friend of mine . He s quite good at pulling . We were all at a party together and he pulled the girl that none of us knew . Ended up back at her place that night having sex while done him high five . So he told us the story the next day . He said she started it . They were having sex . She said , talk dirty to me . Or more accurately . Talk dirty to me . So from the roller decks of filth in his head , he came forth with this . And this would be fine for many of the ladies here . Within the confines of the bedroom , within the Budwad , this would be an okay thing to say . With a long term loving trusting partner . On a one night stand , maybe not . He said , you love it , you slut . LAUGHTER She said , I m not a slut . And there was a very awkward moment . Awkward as moments can be when you ve just insulted someone you re balls deep in . He apologized profusely , needless to say , and they moved on . Imagine there s a story there , mate . Well , you know how when you ve got a phrase you re not meant to say , it s all you can think to say . It s on the tippy a tongue . So like two minutes later , right , my friend , he somehow lost track of what he wasn t meant to say . Says it again . You love it , you slut . She said , I m not a slut . And he got into an argument with her . He didn t mean to , it was like a reflex when she said , I m not a slut for the second time . He went , well , we have just met . She said , you don t know me . He said , well , that just proves my point . Are there any couples in this evening , gives a shout at the couples ? Well , lots of couples in tonight . This is a bit silly , I think . For Valentine s , I ve got my girlfriend s sex vouchers as her present . I didn t realise they were transferable . Turns out they accept them at her work . You get to the stage in a long term relationship where you want to experiment sexually , but you know , it can be awkward . And what if she finds out ? I m 10 years into a relationship now . Anyone beat anyone longer than 10 years ? What s the longest we ve gone the room ? 13 . 26 . Twenty six . Anyone more than 26 ? 28 . More than 28 ? How long ? Sorry . You ve been together for 43 years . I think , come on , 43 years . Now , I don t know what it s like after 43 years . I think that s an extraordinary commitment , especially in this day and age . </s> <s> I don t know if it s the same for you , because I ve only been together with my girlfriend for 10 years . But things have got quite predictable in the bedroom . Now , when I lower my entire ball back into her mouth , she is pretty much guaranteed to wake up . Same ? Are you going to see that ? I m not going to say that . You look worried on their behalf . They ve been married 43 years . Don t panic . They ve tried everything . What s your relationship with them ? How do you know them ? That s your mum and dad . That s nice . Well , I hope the image of your dad teabagging your mum . I hope . I hope the one . I don t know about looking your parents in the eyes again . I don t think you ll be able to dream tea . Hi . Shit , sorry . This will be hard for you to believe . I used to be a gentleman . I didn t use to talk about my sexual exploits , even with close friends . Never kiss and tell . Always just keep it private . It s private life for a reason . Private . Now , I ll talk about anything . It s great for me because it s a catharsis . I think it s good for everyone . Everyone feels a bit more open and normal . There s weird things . Here s an example of an intimate detail I don t mind sharing with you . My girlfriend can t have orgasms during intercourse . But it s not a problem because I can . I gave my girlfriend an orgasm and she spat it back in my face . I gave her an orgasm and she spat it back in my face . I gave her an orgasm and she spat it back in my face . One of my first girlfriend choked to death . It was a terrible blow . I have to finish myself off . There aren t inequalities between the sexes . I think it s university acknowledged men get an easier deal in our society than women . But I can think of an example where men get a very raw deal . When you live together , when you re staying over each other s house , it s a very exciting phase in a relationship . In the history of the world , no man has ever been staying over a girl s house and found a vibrator in a bedside drawer and there s been a problem . There is only one reaction on record and that is as follows . Oh , hello . Cheeky . What is she like ? But when she finds a latex vagina in your sock drawer , there is hell to pay . Explanations must be made . I say sock drawers , actually the office . I say latex vagina , it was the receptionist . All right , let her from the men of Birmingham . Give us a shout at the men . </s> <s> You can specifically give me a shout at the heterosexual men of Birmingham . Same voice as just a little bit lower because you ve got to be . Have you had the conversation , the pub , the classic pub conversation , if you had to sleep with a man , who would it be ? If you had that conversation ? You have that conversation ? I will save you the embarrassment too . I ll tell you what happens in that conversation . So you re in the pub with a mate , having a drink , talking about love and life , whatever . Out of nowhere , you make goes , if you re at the sleep with a man , who do you be ? Well , it wouldn t , so it wouldn t be anyone . But if you had to , who do you be ? Well , it wouldn t , so it wouldn t be anyone . it would be well wooden败 but it would be well woodenblade but if you to though but if it s nice but all婀 well both I got accused of being gay the other day . I was on stage doing a gig and I had a pink shirt on and someone accused me of being gay . But gay to gay shirt , pink shirt , gay ? I can t think of a more masculine colour for a shirt than a pink shirt , because a pink shirt shows the world you don t know how to put a wash on . What could be more masculine ? I often get asked , what celebrities have you been with ? Have you slept with ? I don t want to give it the big one , but it was years ago , so it probably doesn t matter if I say , do you want to know ? Gary Glitter . Have any of you seen my impressions ? Have you seen any of my impressions before ? I don t do many . I do want to know . Are there any lesbians in ? Does anyone enjoy smashing pasties ? Are there any lesbians ? There must be some lesbians surely . What is there a pool tournament on ? Where are the lesbians ? Are there some lesbians up there ? Hello , girls . How are you ? You re all right ? Very nice to have you in . The impression that I do , it s more a physical theatre than an impression per se . But it s the camera man s coming to get the lesbians . It s more a physical theatre than an impression . But it s the breakup of the same sex relationship between two women . I think it captures the emotional turmoil and the anguish will love breaks down . When you still love that person , but you no longer in love with that person and you ve got to go your separate ways . Would you like me to perform with you now ? Okay . Just give me a second . What do you think was going to happen ? I feel duty bound now . </s> <s> What s your name , madam ? What ? Shorow . Okay , fine . Shorow . Shorow . And who are you with ? Who s the other half ? Rosie . Hi . I feel duty bound to ask you the question I ve asked every lesbian I ve ever met . What would it take to get you back on solids ? Oh , I ve got a maybe , yes . I m too bicardy breezes away . Come on . I often get asked about heckles . That s a very common question for me . People want to know what s your favourite heckle , what s the worst heckle , that kind of thing . I was doing a gig last year on the rapier Whittor , the last tour . And I was doing a joke about the power Olympics . Now , when you re doing a joke about the power Olympics , you ve got to be a little bit careful when you re setting up a piece of material like that . You re not fuck witted , just respectful . So I was setting up quite carefully . I d got one sentence in . All I said was , my favourite event at the power Olympics . And this guy at the back of the room , quick as a fucking flash went . Grip wool jump . Yes . I wish I hadn t by fucking piss myself . The other one I loved . I was doing a gig last year in Cardiff . And front and centre . This guy at the front centre where you re sitting there , madam . Out of nowhere , 20 minutes into the gig , he just went . . . Dragon . So there wasn t a massive pause before he said dragon . That was just to let you know what happened there . In my head I had to go , who s caught his that jacket ? To get his started in my head . 20 minutes in he just went , dragon . I went , what ? He went , dragon . I went , yeah , but what you want , he went , I d like a joke about the dragon , please . And he said it like I was the con for turning up in Wales without any dragon based humour . So in the interval I felt duty bound to go and write a joke about a dragon . Do you want to hear my dragon joke ? Yes . Two dragons walk into a pub . Don t panic , Johnny , make sense . Brilliant . Oh , I love John . I m just imagining a funeral cause it , you know . What do they call it when the funeral , when they re all the cars ? Procession , yeah . A funeral procession with drum and bass . As your hair s got blue lights underneath it . </s> <s> I did that because I was looking like it was haunted . Two dragons walk into a bar , one says to the other . It s hiding here , the other one says , shut your mouth . Now I thought what we might do this evening , Birmingham . Obviously you ve all come out to see the show this evening . I m very grateful for that . I love my job . I love the fact you come out to see me live . But we re all sort of friends here . And you ve bought tickets to come and see me at the show . So I tend not to get heckled in the way that I used to get heckled . I used to play the clubs . I used to play the clubs you were unannounced . The venue was bigger than the name , so people would come along . They wouldn t be invested if they didn t like it . They would shout rude things out . I used to love that . Proper aggressive heckling . I thought why don t we ? Because people tend not to do it at these kind of gigs . Because people don t want to fuck up the evening for themselves or for anyone else . Hold your horses just one second . People tend , one notable exception . People tend not to want to fuck the gig up . But I thought it was quite nice . It s quite a fun thing , heckles . So why don t we have a heckle amnesty ? A little two , three minutes where you can just fill your boots . If you ve got something abusive to shout , have at it . Have you actually got to rest ? That was fun . That was so quick . Can t fuck bum . And fuck bum . That s your weird thing to shout , fuck bum . Find the rudest words you know . Fuck bum , can t bum . Any other heckles ? What , sorry ? Peter K was sold out so you had to come here . I m lucky . I bet he wouldn t have called you a cunt . Unfortunately , I m not Peter K . Cunt . It s a very different kind of show . Peter show is good too . Any other heckles ? My crisps tasted rubbish . I ll know you re down . I ll know you re down . I became Latino there for a second . No , you re down . Yeah , I did . I had crisps . Did you see ? I had crisps . Jimmy Concarning crisps . The good people are walkers for comic relief . They brought out a flavour of my crisps and it was me and Al Marien Frank Skinner and Stephen Fry . And then they made these crisps . And every packet they sold , they gave five pence to the starving people in Africa . And I said to them , why don t you just send them the fucking crisps ? LAUGHTER He s got to make more sense , hasn t he ? </s> <s> Because they can t be as fussy about the flavours . If you starve , ain t you fine , aren t you ? Well , these are a bit . . . no , fair enough . Any other heckles ? Where s the comedy on ? When s the comedy on ? When s the comedy ? Really ? What s your name , sir ? What s your name ? David . What s your favourite colour , David ? Blue . Blue , OK ? Seems like the fairest way to do with your David . There are so many things I could say . Number between one and eight , David . Six . OK , and you said to me , when s the comedy on ? It says , if you want my comeback , you ll have to scrape it off your mum s teeth . These things don t lie , David . These things don t lie . No , I m kidding . She swallowed a lot . Any others ? What , sorry ? I ve got . . . I ve got a big nose . What are you fucking retarded at ? I mean , I literally don t have a big nose . That s a weird heck . That s like an insult you ve heard someone else use . You ve gone , I ve got a big fucking laugh . That s going to work best with a comic with a big nose . What s your name , sir ? Thomas . What do you do , Thomas ? You re a student . What are you studying ? Mathematics . Are you at school , Thomas ? I don t know if we should continue this any further , because it s starting to feel like grooming . You at school ? Yeah , I m at school . You ve got a big nose . I haven t . Any other heckles ? Oh , what was that ? That sounded good . What was that ? What was it ? I m a pedophile . I was just fucking chatting to him . I ve done nothing . Any others ? Yes . Dad ? Dad ? Any other heckles ? Be out . What , sorry ? Posh prick . Posh prick seems a bit harsh . What s your name , sir ? Miles . Miles . You think I might be a bit posh . All right , Miles , what s your favourite colour ? Blue . Seems like the ferris way to deal with this . B L U E . Number between one and eight , Miles . Four . Huh ? Oh . Says if you ve come as a cunt , you ve won . Pretty good news . Ha , ha , ha ! Any more for any more ? Who the fuck has a side parting ? You re going to kick yourself on a tell you , eh ? </s> <s> Me . I think you know your doctor isn t great . If the STI check is a taste test . My girlfriend used to smoke after sex , so we started using lubricant . I was in bed with a girl recently , she said , I want tonight to be magical . And it was . After I fucked her , I disappeared . I go into an argument with my ex , and in the middle of the argument , she went , what kind of an idiot do you take me for ? I couldn t resist , I went , I fought one . In my defence , she was fat . She didn t get a suntan , she got crackling . She was legally required to make a beeping noise when moving backwards . She wasn t that big we got together , but she bloomed . I mean , I ve seen girls put on weight before , but she took the biscuit . On the plus side . Just a nice way of saying it . I quite like euthamism . Of course , the classic euthamism is if someone s gay instead of saying gay , you would say , he s a friend of dara things . Someone s really fat , I like to say , he s a friend of grecs . At a super awkward moment on stage recently . So it was on stage doing a gig . I said any questions , and someone went , oh , you ever going to have children ? I said , I don t want to make you feel bad about asking , but my girlfriend and I actually can t have children . That s the way we do it . So you re just trying the other way , because you can t get pregnant in the mouth either . Are there any parents in with any parents ? Give us a shout , parents ? Is anyone got parents ? You have to think about that . You re an idiot . Only point about parents is all parents have got a favourite . If your parents told you they didn t have a favourite , all it means is you weren t it . Unless you re an only child . If you re an only child , and your parents went out of their way to tell you they didn t have a favourite , that is bad . With her last child , Angelina Jolie had a very difficult delivery . She wasn t in and had to pick it up from the sorting office . In a long term relationship , it s important to be a good listener . I think she s asleep . I might pop downstairs for a wink . You re familiar with the phrase , fuck buddy . Have you heard the phrase fuck buddy ? Yes . I ve got a friend that didn t know what that meant . I used it in a conversation and he didn t know what it meant . I had to explain what a fuck buddy was . </s> <s> I said it was like a friend you have regular sex with . He said , well , how s that different from an normal relationship ? I said , there you re friend . And you have regular sex with him ? It s like the opposite of a normal relationship . I found out the hard way . There s a big difference between hanging out with a mate s girlfriend and hanging out of a mate s girlfriend . It s a lovely turn of phrase . I could get a job on Sky Sports . I got into an argument with my girlfriend . She said , you treat this house like a hotel . I said , I have never snorted cocaine opera hookers tits in this house . Tom McGill for in the top she was wearing was too revealing . She said , Jimmy sometimes cries after sex . We re going to a row . You ll be familiar with this . If you re in a long term relationship , this is a kind of scenario for a row . But I think happens a lot . We re going to a fight on the way back from a party . So we went to this amazing party . It s about 2 . 30 in the morning . We re driving home . So I m driving . I haven t had anything to drink . Stone Cold sober driving . She s had quite a lot to drink . I mean , in terms of units of alcohol , she s had an awful lot to drink . But she s not drunk . And I know she s not drunk . I know she isn t drunk because she told me she wasn t drunk . 400 fucking tires . You know , like sober people don t . And with the worst thing about this argument , I didn t even say anything . Someone else said something . And she was talking about that . And I just agreed with the fact that the other person said . And it was a fact . It wasn t a point for debate . It was a fact . So it was driving along , right ? She s talking a lot . I m listening a little . Okay , my bad . But she s telling me about the evening in real time . And I was there for most of it . So I don t need to be hearing this . A lot of the stories involve me . So we re driving along . She tells me this story . And she goes to the point she said this mutual friend of ours , this girl that we both know . She said , that girl . That girl said my dress for short . I went , yeah , it is . You re taking her side . What do you go back to the party ? What do you drive her home ? It was short . I mean , it was a really short . It was what I would call a greyhound . It s called a greyhound . It was just an inch away from there . </s> <s> It was a really short skirt . So I went , it is short . Yeah . She went , ah , you re taking her side . When you go back to the party and drive her home , then if you fancy her so much , try not to mind me . You say , no , I ve got a fat legs . Suddenly fucking chew back is in the car . Never fucking fancy anyone . So fun . It s just snot and . . . Next thing I know , like within 20 seconds , she s pulling on the car door . We re doing 40 miles an hour , middle of nowhere , 230 in the morning . She s going , oh , walk home . Oh , walk home . Trying to open the car door . She s not wearing a seabuck because she s pissed . Opening the car door , it s safer . Opening the car door . I just stop the car . It s dangerous , right ? So as soon as I stop the car , she fucks off out , immediately . Teetering on heels up the road . No coat , no money , no keys . No idea why she s fucking going . Oh , walk home . Oh , walk home . Don t even fucking go . I ll walk home . Oh , walk home . So I have to do the beautiful boy for anything of driving . I ve got four fucking miles an hour . Come on , get back in the car . It s all my fault . Not my fault , I ve done fuck all here . Come on , get back in the car . I ll buy you chips . Just please just get back in the car . Anyway , long story short , I got arrested for curve crawling . I don t know about you , but I think the best thing about a big , passionate argument is tumbling into bed together afterwards and lying in cold , grim silence until dawn . Are you asleep ? I can t sleep , I m too full of hate . Any fans of Make Up Sex in ? Anyone had good Make Up Sex ? Give a shout , yes ? Make Up Sex is pretty awesome , but timing is critical . Because if you get overexcited , you go for the Make Up Sex too early and the argument s still happening , that is a little bit rapy . Let s hear it from the ladies of Birmingham . Give us a shout , ladies . Are you saying it very good , Spurs ? Do you think you re easy to live with , ladies ? The vast majority say yes . Well , this is going to be educational and informative . I m going to tell you how easy you want to live with , ladies , and I m going to do it with a couple of questions . Okay ? Have you ever met a gay man ? </s> <s> Yes . Have you ever noticed how happy homosexual men are ? How joyful and carefree and full of life . We re going dancing , Bacardi Breezes . Hiya ! Well , that s what we were like before we met you .

My grandmother , I loved her to death . It s mother to I m joking , I fucked her . Now , I don t normally do political stuff on my stage show , you know , on the tour , but I saw something that caught my eye recently . It was in Croydon . Anyone in from Croydon ? One person down there , I hope you re having a knife crime . Sorry . Nice time , my bad . So it was this thing , it happened in Croydon . I saw it in the local paper down in Croydon , and it was a BNP campaign . Are you familiar with this carnival of cunts ? It was a British National Party campaigner . It was handing out leaflets in Croydon High Street , and you know , when people are handing out leaflets , I mean , handing out leaflets in Croydon High Street for the BNP is the everest of stupid needless to say . But he s handing out these leaflets . You know , sometimes you don t look at a leaflet when you re in the high street . You just pick it up and kind of , you know , you don t take it . I mean , you re a couple of steps before you look at the thing . So it s going to pick up a leaflet . Oh , British National Party , that s interesting . Bam . And properly connected with a punch . Now , I m not advocating violence . Never solved anything . But on this occasion , I will let it go , because he gave the BNP campaigner a black eye . And that is pre genius . Because for that fucker , that s adding insult to injury . A lot of planning is going on in London for the 2012 Olympics . Sadly , most of it is being done by Al Qaeda . I just don t understand it . Why would you become an Islamic fundamentalist suicide bomber on the off chance ? You might get 72 virgins when you die . Become a Catholic priest and have them now . Life s for living , am I right ? My favourite suicide bomber last year . Oh , you re better than me because you haven t got a list . My favourite suicide bomber . Well , I ve got a couple that I really like . The Detroit bomber . Do you know this guy that flew into Detroit last Christmas ? </s> <s> So flew into Detroit airport . He had an explosive device in his underpants . The triggering device went off . The explosives didn t detonate . So there was smoke billowing around . But everything didn t blow up straight away . Just smoke billowing . So the other passengers , you can imagine , in America post 9 11 , how they put him out . They didn t run and get a safety blanket and some water and a stewardess . No , they stamped the fuck around . In quite a camp flamenco style , if this is anything to go with . Possibly with a . . . But I mean , they fucking ruined this guy . They didn t kill him , but they ruined him . Now , normally , I would say , well , you know what ? Fuck him . He was trying to kill innocent people as they flew home for Christmas . Fuck him very much . But my heart goes out to this guy . Because he s caught cases coming up in America in the next couple of months . And he s going to have a very tough time in a court of law defending himself . Because the prosecution have got it so easy . The prosecution is just going to go , you telling the truth ? Yeah , I m telling the truth . Will you pan some fire ? LAUGHTER My favourite suicide bomber , though , he was an assassin suicide bomber in the United Arab Emirates . He was sent to kill one man . He didn t . He just killed himself . Technically , a win for them , but I m very happy with that . So he was sent to kill this guy . And in order to get close to the guy , he was going to try and kill . He had to conceal the bomb . He had the bomb concealed . Wait for it . Up his bum . Literally a suicide bomber . LAUGHTER I mean , if people are going to start putting bombs up their bombs , the shit is really going to hit the fan . LAUGHTER Now , I don t know how that bomb was detonated . But I like to think , in this day and age , even someone as fuck witted as a suicide bomber , even someone that morally retarded would have seen the opportunity for comedy in that situation . And that bomb , up his bum , would have been detonated , something along the lines of . . . Poor my finger . LAUGHTER I can pass this by going , what did he have for lunch ? Oh , I ve got some more pictures . Do you want to see some more pictures ? Yeah ! See some more pictures . I was going to talk to you briefly about sports , ladies and gentlemen .

I saw something on the internet the other day that really shocked me . It was one man having sex with one woman . There was no gang bang , no DP , no anal , no dwarves , no freeway , no water sports , no girl on girl , no gagging , no rimming , no granny fanny , no DV , no DA , no she mails , no milf son , no belly legal . If you re just one man having sex with one woman , I thought , well , who comes up with this crazy shit ? LAUGHTER It s talk about sex . Adult supervision . To me , adult supervision sounds like the ability to see through bras . LAUGHTER LAUGHTER The average speed of ejaculation is 43 miles per hour , which is why it s so important to keep it away from children . LAUGHTER 20 is plenty . Around children you ve got to be very careful with the language that you use . For example , say fiddle sticks instead of vibrators . LAUGHTER I don t think lesbian should be allowed to use vibrators . You ve made your decision . LAUGHTER APPLAUSE No more sin on the fence . Neither . LAUGHTER I m Afro dites . LAUGHTER Can go and fuck themselves . LAUGHTER A transvestite is a man that dresses to look like a woman and the woman they dress to look like . His Jane looked Donald . LAUGHTER Someone told my girlfriend the best way to improve oral sex was to hum . All I m saying is the theme from Curry is not erotic . Mm hmm . Ain t all sex for women is like mormite .

It s probably when I first got introduced to my girlfriend s parents . I remember my girlfriend saying , there s the bad man there . LAUGHTER I don t like the term partner because it makes it sound like we re fighting crime . LAUGHTER I don t like the term housewife or stay at home mum . I prefer to say lazy sluts . LAUGHTER My girlfriend says she s good at doing two things at the same time . If that s the case , why is a threesome out of the question ? LAUGHTER Don t judge me , I improvised . It s not that bad , it s got a face . I often walk around the house naked till the neighbours chase me inside . LAUGHTER Some friends of mine just had a baby , but because of some issues , they had to use a surrogate mother and because of a medical thing they had to use a sperm donor . So really what I m saying is , some people I don t know just had a baby . One of the symptoms of having conjunctivitis is that when you wake up in the morning your eyes are so sticky you can hardly open them . My girlfriend has it a lot . LAUGHTER Sometimes she gets conjunctivitis on her tits . LAUGHTER Right , final one of these . This is my favourite joke in the show . I m going to try not to fuck it up , but I slightly fucked it up last night because I giggled halfway through . But I m going to dig deep for Birmingham . OK . I can do this . When I broke up with my first wife , I didn t want anything from her in the settlement , except a pint of milk , four egg yolks , of vanilla pod , an ounce of caster sugar and two fluid ounces of single cream . She mixed the whole lot up in a bowl and she threw it at my face . But on the plus side , I did get custody . LAUGHTER Oh , no ! That s what I want . I think civil partnerships are gay . Apparently one of the biggest fears is the unknown , like . . . I d know . Apparently taking the dog for a walk is a good way to find a woman . But what if you want to find a woman who s still alive ? Did you read about this American man that s suing his ex wife to get back to the kidney he donated to her while they were married ? </s> <s> That is taking the piss . My father always used to say to me , there s no such word as Kant . I said , no , I called you a Kant . People claim to be into recycling , but you should see their faces when you rinse out a condom . I do a bit of baking . Is anyone else baking cookies and cakes and things ? I do a bit of baking . My specialty is a brownie with nuts , which I call a scout . Come on , where s your sense of fun ? Do you get annoyed by cold callers ? You know , oven evening . You re at home relaxing after a hard day at work , watching TV flick into a magazine . The phone rings is a strange voice . You don t recognise talking about something you re not interested in . Oh , Mr . Jimmy , I have your baby now . You send money quick . You bad man ! It s hot off . Do you get this ? Do you get the public private phone call problem ? So this is when you re at work surrounded by colleagues or in the pub surrounded by friends . You get a phone call off your other half , and at the end of the phone call they say something that you would normally say something back . It s like you re a little bit your thing , but you don t want to say it because there s people around . It s a bit embarrassing . So the end of the phone call goes , Alright , bye . That , Nina , I do . There s people around . I don t want to . Well , we don t be like that . Alright , I ll say it . I want to choke you with my cock . A charity worker came to my front door and they were collecting for a homeless shelter . So gave me a cardboard box . Beggars can t be choosers , am I right ? I did one of those nude calendars for charity . Yeah , Childline will live it . I did a gig for Alzheimer s sufferers . It was brilliant . Two hours . One joke . I did a gig for Alzheimer s sufferers . Right , final thought . If only Africa had more mosquito nets than every year we could save millions of mosquitoes from dying needlessly of AIDS . I ll be Jimmy Carp . Thank you very much indeed . Cheers , Guna . Thank you . Good afternoon . Thank you very much . Very nice of you Birmingham . I couldn t ask for a better audience . It would hurt your feelings . That s pretty much my show . I thought a nice way to end might be there s a theory in comedy . Lenny Bruce , the American satirist , was the first to say , said , the audience is a genius . And the idea is , the audience you regulate comedy . You decide what a comedian can t say on stage because if you don t laugh at a joke , it is not socially acceptable . If you do , then just by definition it is socially acceptable . I thought we could put that to the test tonight . </s> <s> We could start gently work our way up and see what stage Birmingham goes . Oh , for fuck s sake . Do you want to give it a go ? Okay , well , we ll start gentle , we ll work our way up . So everyone s comfortable . At some stage , people will stop laughing and then that s the end . Hmm , sight . Well , we ll start gentle . Pope Benedict , incidentally , is called Pope Benedict because he comes with a Hollanday sauce . Hang on , that s not a Hollanday sauce . Benedict . As head of the Catholic Church , Pope Benedict is the boss of every Catholic priest in the world . He s effectively King of the Pidos . I read about a Catholic priest that exposed himself so they defrocked him . They don t help themselves , do they ? Well , they do , that s part of the problem . This scandal could bring the Catholic Church to its knees . You ve got to finish that one in your own head . It s somewhat ironically . I personally , I don t think the Pope should worry about this , ex candle . It ll all get sorted out soon enough when Jesus Christ , our Lord and Savior , comes back from the made up . Well , you all seem pretty happy with a little bit of Christian baiting , yeah ? Should we take it up again ? Okay . My girlfriend could be really loud during sex . I don t know why , she knows no one s coming to help . Fine . Up another gear ? Treat a mean , keep them keen . Your head expression ? Treat a mean , keep them keen . Treat the mean , you will keep them keen . If that was true , if that really worked , treat a mean , keep them keen . Wouldn t the Jews absolutely adore the Germans ? Really ? Really ? A round of applause on a joke about the worst thing that s ever happened . Why did we go from there ? It s a joke about the worst thing that s ever happened . This might offend some of you . People say , smug sanctimonious people in my opinion , but people do say from time to time you hear them . Princess Diana should have been wearing a seatbelt . If she d been wearing a seatbelt , she d be here with us today . To those people I say this , I say , you try . Snorting cocaine off a cock in the back of a limo while wearing a seatbelt . It can t be fucking done . I saw that little , that little , shaky head there , and I presume that was disapproval madam . But to me , that looked like you were going , it can t be done . I ve tried a million fucking times . Where did we go from there ? OK , so we ve had one fucking out , but everyone else seems fine . You better fuck off . A child can drown in just four inches of water , but you might as well run above . </s> <s> That feels like it should have been more offensive than it was . A child died in that joke . I tend to do wordplay , so you get away with murder with wordplay , literally in that last joke . Because people go , it s just a joke , it doesn t really matter . Actually , when you talk about real stuff that s happened in your life , it s a bit darker . And sort of observation stuff , people think of as being more sort of family friendly . But when you talk about real stuff that s happened to you , that s where people get more offended , if it happens to be darker . And then you know , there s a weird thing where that s where comedy is useful . When bad things happen in your life , you need a bit of cheering up . That s where comedy has a purpose in our lives . Let s talk about something that s happened to me recently . And I m fine talking about it , so I don t think it should be a problem for you to hear about it . But it is a little bit more , because it is a real thing . It s some people get a bit edgy , a bit more offended by stuff that s real . My girlfriend recently had a miscarriage , and it was doubly bad because I had to pay for it . That feels like we re getting somewhere . And I realise an abortion can be a very upsetting thing for a woman . But at the same time , who doesn t get a little confidence boost when they lose a bit of weight ? Well , let s cut to the chase on this show . Let s talk about what you can and what you cannot say on stage . For a good friend of mine , a guy that I ve worked with the last ten years , we re pretty close . We ve written jokes together and we know each other . He knows that I say this on stage , he s fine with it . But Frankie Ball , do you want to know Frankie , yes ? Frankie got into a lot of trouble last year for doing a joke on stage that contained the word Down syndrome . And I think it s sad . I think it does nothing more than betray his ignorance and insensitivity . What a spastic . Why are they called sunshine variety coaches when all the kids on board look the same ? Well , if that joke s getting a round of applause , I m out . Happy to back away from there . It s a weird thing though , because I suppose the thing that we ve all got in common in this room is we all share a sense of humour . We re all laughing at the same kind of things . And so , a weird thing where I laugh the very loudest just before I have a sense of humour failure . </s> <s> I find that if the closer to the edge , the funniest jokes for me are the jokes that I laugh at . And as I m laughing , I go , I m a terrible human being . Fine , you know . I m a terrible human being . Do you want to hear the joke that got me ? I heard a joke , it s an Australian joke , just a pub joke from Australia . That gives you an idea of how fucking brooklet is . The Aussies came up with it . Are you sure you want to hear this ? I ll just cleanse my palate before I tell you this . Like a sorbet . Like a salero . LAUGHTER How do you make a gay fuck a woman ? Shit in her cunt . LAUGHTER I know . I know . I know . Don t think I don t know , cos I know . I know . I know . There s no use giving me a look as if I didn t pay 25 and listen to this filth . Because you did and you know you did . I realise my jokes can often be brutal and cruel . And when you think about the content of what I m talking about in these jokes , it is unacceptable , frankly . But then , the only purpose of these jokes is to make you laugh . There s no message here . No one s learned anything this evening , have they ? My fucking hope not . The only purpose for these jokes is to make you laugh for two hours . It s to release in dolphins . That s all I m doing up here . They re just jokes . I m just messing around . And some people just like being offended . So we think I did a gig in Newcastle last year and this woman came up to me afterwards at the signing , face like fucking thunder . I went , that was disgusting , rude , juvenile , filth . No better than last year . Fuck off . And what the fuck I meant to do with that ? Pretty crazy fool . Sorry about that joke . You realise that joke about the Australian pub joke . You realise that s the only joke you will now be able to remember . That s the way that works . Whatever the most defensive joke is , it s the only one you ll be able to recall . The next time you re at a family wedding or a funeral . You re fucking hell . Oh , John . I just , I know you re here to collect the body of . . . I ve lost my husband . I feel so terribly low . Maybe a joke would cheer me up . How d you make a gay fucker woman ? I get me out . Well , I haven t been up here on my own this evening . First and foremost , I interviewed him earlier . He s a funeral director . </s> <s> If you die , wouldn t you want to be looked after by him ? And when I say looked after , I mean nothing more than what is normal . John , everyone , give him around the floor . Thanks , John . Thanks for coming down . Please say it . Thank you so much for coming out . Especially this evening , because it s been sort of , you know , the DVD record , which is always a bit of a nerve wracking gig . And I fucking love playing Birmingham . And I love coming here . And I couldn t if you didn t buy tickets to come out to the show . So thanks so much . I really do appreciate it , because I love my job . Thank you so much for being a good person . People with Tourette s . What ? What makes them tick ? That was originally about suicide bombers . I ve toned it down for you . </s>"

It s just me personally , because I got called ma am from behind the other day , and I didn t correct anybody . I left that shit out in the ether . I was at a burger king . I was like , ma am , your fries are ready . I didn t turn her off . Uh , I m a boy . No , I said , give me those goddamn fries . And I walked out of that place with my head held up high , like the bad bitch I was . All right ? So sorry if you ve never had Lizzo energy as a man , but I had it . I knew what it was like . I feel immortal in 2023 . That s what it s like . That s what it is . And let me go ahead and explain this mullet so your eyeball stop doing that thing right now . What s that about ? I don t know that . I have to explain in LA that I m not from Texas . I got Texas like , no , man , this is a golden state mullet . This is a California mullet , all right ? Not from LA though . I m from Stockton , California . Anybody heard of it ? Couple people . Couple people . The rest of you . It s just a cherry picking mullet . This mullet s very agricultural , all right ? And what do they say about mullets , everybody ? Business in the front ? They don t work like that with this face . With this face . It s very much missing child s poster in the front . And then guy who kidnapped that kid in the back . I just want to see my kids please . Let me play Legos with them please . No ? OK . I am also , I m first generation Mexican . Oh , yeah . There we go . Yeah , my father . He was an illegal immigrant . He hopped the border . He touched America . He said , safe . OK . No takes his back . He s home base . Home base , I say . Here s how Mexican I am . On my father s deathbed when he passed away , he left me a sauce recipe on a barn African . There was some Harry Potter shit . You know , it was like magic chick to a squirrel . Me , ho , write it down . I got it . Salon trail . I got it . It seems important . I m only trying to build up how Mexican I am to let the rest of you know I m ashamed . I still love Taco Bell with everything I have in my heart . Yeah , the white people are wooing . That s fair . That s fair . I see some very Mexican face like , I don t know about that . Like if you re a cholo with the Raiders tattoo , you re a Latte Taco Bell . </s> <s> God bless you . God bless you . You re an American citizen . But I have people in my life . They find it problematic when I go to places like Taco Bell . They get mad at me . They go , why would you do that ? You could be eating real Mexican food right now . And I have to explain to them , I have real Mexican food . It s in the fridge . My mom made it . But every now and then my dad was very accepting and cool . You guys want to go get some crunch wraps ? Because he understood the Taco Bell is like the Beastie boys , you know ? It s not authentic , but you can t deny talent . That s pretty good . I mean . It s economically priced food for drunks and portrache , you know ? And you need it . There are haters out there that be smurched Taco Bell s name by doing studies that state about to shit like facts . Because apparently , apparently , a percentage of the Taco Bell meat is sand . We knew . I mean , it s called ground beef . It s the ground plus beef . What are you not reading at ground beef ? There it is . Ground beef . I read that . I can read , you know ? And this burrito cost me 2 today in 2020 . You got to be cutting it with something , you know ? Thank you for not being fentanyl . Let it be sand from being honest . I m happy I m here . I m married , man . I married my best friend . I love my wife . She s the best . Thank you . A couple of us . A couple of us . I m in an interracial relationship . My wife is white . And here s the thing . We ve been married for three years , but I m still not used to being with a white woman , you know ? She grew up with friends in a nice neighborhood behind a gated community . And the friends from my neighborhood are in a different type of gated community now , all right ? So it s just different , you know ? And I don t mean to generalize , or at least I don t want to generalize , but at least with my wife , it feels like white women love to hit you with fun facts every single day . And I m not used to that . I m used to the Mexican women . I mean , they just love to hit you , all right ? There s no snapple fackled bullshit , you know ? Did you know ? Fuck , I didn t know . I didn t want to know your fact about platypus that you sent me via TikTok . Thank you . She s also passive aggressive , my wife . She hit me with what I thought was a fun fact , but it was a passive . </s> <s> She s like , did you know that if a couple has been trying to have a baby for two years and no baby has happened , they should go see a fertility doctor ? Yeah , I don t know if you could tell by my personality . I m like , oh , that s cool . Thank you for letting me know that . And she was like , we should go see a fertility doctor . And then I was like , we ve been trying it ? I ve just been fucking . And who are you talking about ? I ve been trying to come this whole time . Wait a minute . We don t got to see a doctor . You re going to have to give me another chance , all right ? These pumps will have intent . I promise , I thought these are recreational games . I didn t know where you re keeping score , you know ? And I m not saying it s her , but I know it s not me . I m Mexican . Don t die . Down to the stereotype . I have a deal . I have an uncle that s where to go . I am two years older than you . You do the math on that type of fertility . I ll jerk up onto a dead plant . It ll come back to life . With stronger leaves . Like , yeah , I know . Look at that . Yeah , it was a rose , but it s a pepper plant now . I don t know . I don t know . I have powers or something . Now we re thinking about kids . She says that I m sexist . That any time we talk about our hypothetical child , I go , he , him . I don t know if it s because I m Mexican or millennial , but I guess I want a boy . I want a boy real bad . But if we had a girl , I d be amazing too . But I m going to be honest . If we had a girl , I wouldn t lose hope on having a boy , you know ? Doctors like , congratulations Mr . Treheo . It s a girl . I m going to go for now . You don t know . All right ? It s a new world , doc . You re talking about science ? Nah , I m a gambling man . And you don t think a little piece of me down line hopes my daughter doesn t come up to me . But bye , I want you guys something to tell you . What s wrong , sweetheart ? I want to be a boy . I ll go , God damn right you do . Welcome to the team . And then I got secret gender reveal fireworks . I ve been hiding . And then Blue Confetti comes down as me and my new son have cigars . Get over here . My kiss them . Some of you are probably got tested last show . They re like , well , you re probably still sexist . What happens if you have a boy ? </s> <s> And he wants to be a girl . And I just let you know , it just be different . Just be different . Say my son , he said a high school party . He s drunk . He s high . He s 16 . Trying to get the curts to tell me and his mom something important wakes me up in the middle of the night . Dad , I want to be a girl . And as I m wiping my eyes , you re grounded . Nah , she s grounded . Because no daughter reminds them about their party all night . All right ? You re my sweet baby , Angel . And we ve been worried sick , you know ? Like get over here , baby . And then I caress her mustache face . And then she goes to her room and she hangs up her letter and jacket . I m like , I love you , sweetheart . You re the best . God bless my wife . She s the best . I mean , she fucks me . So God bless her . Do you hear this voice ? Imagine this voice in any sexual scenario . Yeah , girl , get over here . That s not good . That s not nice . That s nice to say to a lady . And I m trying to lose weight . When I first started comedy , I was 430 pounds . Now roughly 295 , you know ? Sure . Sure . Sure . Clap away . It s not for health . It s so I could fuck better , OK ? I have a responsibility now . I am married . All right . It s not like trick the one night standoff to the next . You got to lay in that disappointment . All right ? I want this belly gone . I know we re supposed to be body positive , but it s hard to make love as a man with a belly . Every time I make love to my wife , I got to hold my belly back like it s about to fight someone outside of a nightclub . You need to take it easy , OK ? You need to take it easy .

Comment down . It s not always about you . Like any good comedian I did have a rough childhood growing up . You know , that s why I m so good at this . Trauma when they got fun . I did a crazy dad growing up . And for whatever reason , whenever I tell people I had a crazy dad , they always want to tell me about their dad and their dad s never that crazy . You know ? They re like , oh yeah , my dad s crazy . He drinks soda with no ice . Like he s crazy . But my dad was like , crazy . You know , like my dad came at me with a sledgehammer , tried to build a bomb to blow me and my mom up . I was raised by Wiley fucking Coyote , OK ? Like my first words were meep meep . It was very exciting in the Morales households . And I don t want you guys to feel bad . Don t tighten up . Don t feel bad . Because I figured out a way to thwart my dad . What I would do is I would paint a tunnel on the wall , run through it , and then he would get hit by a train . It was hilarious . You know , well adjusted families play catch . We play catch the train . Same shit . When you re raised by crazy , you get some of it . I call it trickle down crazy nomics . I got a sco , sure . Some kids get trust funds , baby . I just got the issues . But they are trust fund size . Know that I could build generational wealth with the amount of trust I don t have in any of you people . I m also a broad . If you didn t pick up on it yet , a chick , she , her , whatever word you want to use . I m very bad at it , obviously , because I just referred to myself as a broad . Not a lot of chicks doing that . But I am a chick . I m very bad at it . I ve been trying to fend it up . You know , like I started washing my hair . I stopped wearing cleats . I m working on it . Just always been this way . This is what a grown up tomboy looks like . And for some reason , I always thought that there was something wrong with me . I always thought that there was something that didn t feel right . And it turns out there is . Yeah . I got this stuff called the Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome . </s> <s> Yeah . Please don t fall asleep . Very boring stuff . But all it means is that my body just naturally makes way too much estrogen , the female hormone , right ? And then it compensates with testosterone . Like , I m such a chick . I m a fucking dude . I m ODing on that gender right now , bruh . Like , I m all of you put together . And to be honest , it s a lot . It is . It s like an ongoing Twitter feed . Both sides are yelling . One just in a wig . But they re both Michael Rappapour for some reason . You know ? I m like , what the hell am I getting yelled at for ? I ve never even been to Long Island . She s set alone to herself in a grocery store bathroom . It s a lot . It s almost like my body decided to start chemically transitioning and didn t let a bitch know . Because I m idling . Right at about 25 guy , right ? Which is just enough . Just enough to give you some sweet cyburns . Oh yeah , dude . I could connect if I want to . Sweet cyburns . Sweet cyburns and no boyfriend , baby . Because I don t know if you guys know this , but straight guys don t like banging other guys . And that s the vibe mama gives off , you know ? That high T makes you go about it the wrong way . Like , I thought I was supposed to nut check you until you fell in love with me . That s what I thought . That s what I thought I was supposed to be doing . Yeah , just bullying the love of my life , you know ? Just noogying my way into your heart . Like , when are you going to marry me , fucking nerd ?

I like to look at the audience when I perform . And I do feel like some of you are having a good time . But we got a lot of indica motherfuckers in here , too . You guys need to . But I do .

But for some reason , there s a certain kind of dude that refuses to enjoy me . And I don t know why . I don t know if it s because I come off a little too assertive on stage , you know ? Maybe instinctually , they just know if we share to jail cell , mama gets the bottom bunk , bitch . Maybe that s what it is . Maybe that s what it is . But they always watch me perform the same way . They always got their arms crossed , furrowed , brow . They won t laugh . They grumble at me , you know ? Bleh , bleh , bleh , bleh . You know what it is ? They watch me perform like I m suspicious .

I worked about eight hours last year . So it s a give and take . You know , a lot of ups and downs , baby . A lot of swings . Just like poker . Real fun and unpredictable . I cry a lot , you know . There s perks to it . That s probably my favorite , you know , perks . Because my favorite perks are probably traveling because I just get to go places . And fuck strangers . And then leave . It s amazing . Especially for a chick with commitment issues . Like , I got , you know what I mean ? Because I just come into town . Be charming and fun . Pleasurable company will ensue .

And by the way , if you got it , I m not knocking you . If anything , I feel left out at this point . Because everybody s got it . And they always got a fun story about how it happened . I was hanging out with a group of friends . And two of my friends were going back and forth about how they got it . Like one of them made it cooler than the other . I don t know what it was like . Like an adorable little slut off was happening . Like , oh , what , bitch ? No , I fucked a white guy with dreads , 2016 Coachella .

        "transcript": "<s> Oh my god , this is awesome . I m happy to be here . I m gay that s gonna be really big for this But but first I just kind of want to do some very quick impressions that reveal a little bit about me I m just gonna get right into it . Here we go . Here s the very first impression I am something to say ! Us , allies , have to do better ! That was me at my high school s gay straight alliance . This next one I m gonna do , that s real . This next one I m gonna do is insane . That was my grandma after I came out to her . Oh my god . Total fag hag . This next one I m gonna do is really personal . That s me talking about my roommate in zoom therapy . Sam Morrison . This next one I m gonna do is also extremely personal . There s two sides to every story ! That s my roommate during my zoom therapy . Sam Morrison . But you know a little bit about me . I am gay . I have an identical gay twin brother . Where s the pilot ? You know me and him we are very close and I think it s because we were actually the very first people that we ever came out to you know sophomore year of high school . He came up to me and he was like Dylan I don t know I I think I might be attracted to guys and I was like ew don t ever say that again ! Bag it ? No . But then a year later I was like same . So um it s our story you know we came out to our whole family . I came out to my mom and when we did she was literally so excited and having two gay twin sons quickly became her whole personality . Like one time she opened the fridge and beans fell out she was like there s so much drama in my life . She s like Asian Michelle Visage all the sudden except one time in 2004 we were all watching American Idol she was like more like gay we were like what ? Other than that she s an ally . It was a different time you know . But my brother and I were close not just because we were both gay we both wet the bed until we were 17 years old . Where s the record deal ? No um it s embarrassing . We both wore this device called a PL arm no no one knows what this is I ll explain . It s a device that we attached to our underwear and when we wet ourselves it would jolt us awake sounding like a police siren . But my brother and I were such deep sleepers sometimes both of our PL arms would go off and we were just asleep so one night our mom burst in she was like gays I was just sucking your dad s cock and both your alarms woke up your sister go pee my faggot . She s so quirky you know she s like I should be in euphoria you know but but it gets better you know um I m in therapy who hears in therapy oh yes I love to hear that I I love my therapist so much but I feel like she still doesn t know that I am fundamentally evil . </s> <s> You know she s like it s trauma I m like I m Jafar haha you know and like in therapy you re supposed to like take care of the inner child and foster the inner child and I really want you but sometimes my inner child is like your mother sucks cocks and hell faggot I m like we ll circle back we ll circle back Gertrude that s his name but you know I ve been extremely vulnerable with you all tonight and I m gonna end on an extremely vulnerable thing I m gonna I m gonna do a song about something that actually happened to me three weeks ago it s very fresh and raw and vulnerable but please laugh because that s my only sense of self worth hit it . I just drunk messaged my bully on Facebook asking him why d you do it it was 12 years ago but it still fucks me up to this day sometimes before I perform I think who the hell do you think you are you re just an annoying twink asking far too many questions in math class shut up I have rehearsed how I d curse out my bully I have if I could turn back time because the way I responded in high school was stop and now I see him on Facebook he seems to be doing relatively well he has a girlfriend yeah I hope my bully chokes on a thousand chokes I hope he chokes on a chode and then chokes on another chode I hope his face is disfigured from how many chodes he has to choke on I m sorry Michelle Obama I m not rising above this time I go lower the reason why I m doing comedy is because the bullying made me want to become famous so I tried out acting singing dancing tap dance gymnastics and magic but the one thing that stuck was comedy but I really don t give a shit what art form it is just so long as I get famous to prove the bully s wrong I don t give a shit about the craft I hope my bully gags on a thousand peens different word peen I hope he chokes on a chode while he sees me in the Shang Chi sequel I hope he sees me on Oprah Oprah s like were you bullied I m like yes I was then I face the camera and say John I hope you re enjoying that chode Super Soul Sunday as a side note if you dislike me you are inherently homophobic if you don t like my set you are not on the right side of history if you re gay and you hate me you re racist if you re a queer person of color and you hate me you re jealous and also racist oh my god he just saw my message and he s responding this is what he said Dylan I m sorry in high school I was insecure and it took it out on you I feel really bad anyway I know you re doing comedy how s that going and I was like good yes comedy is going good I m actually doing comedy central it s kind of nice the reason why I wrote this song is because I wanted some good to come out of the bad the next thing I said was I forgive you just kidding it still fucks me up every day someone on twitter called me dollar tribo bird I m in a tree I still hope that you drown in a sea of foreskin I hope that you are run over by a militia of uncut dicks I hope the devil s like I m a fan of Dylan s comedy while you are burning in hell this song is not about rising above because there is a wound within me that will never believe you </s> <s> </s>"

        "transcript": "<s> That s the thing about LA , it s always the prettiest people . I love it , because I m not actually from here originally . I m from New England , I m from the Boston area . Anybody else ? Yeah , there s a couple of us , yeah ? Well , they let a lot of you in here with free drinks . That s fun . What a risky move . I have to say I m from the Boston area , because if you say you re from Boston and somebody else is actually from the city and you re not , then they fucking hate you , you know ? And I m not from there , I m actually from south of Boston . Not to be confused with south Boston , which if you re from there , you re probably pretty badass . Probably pretty cool . No , no , I m from south of Boston , near Plymouth , like where the pilgrims came in . So how white are you ? Yup . But now I live out in LA , I live here and it s a good place to live , because actually this past year I ve been transitioning . I m actually a trans man , yeah ? Thank you . Thank you . I appreciate that , it s weird . I ve only been transitioning the last year , year and a half , so it s still so weird for me whenever I tell the audience , I never know how you guys are gonna react . Sometimes I feel like it would be easier if I just came out on stage first and just had a quick gender reveal party , you know ? Just pass out a bunch of cupcakes . We all take a bite at the same time , a little blue frosting in the middle . I m like , oh , it s a boy . I actually just think every trans person , I m not even part of my set , just a genius idea that every trans person should get to have a gender reveal party . Like it was blue the whole time . But I m just kidding , I actually hate gender reveal parties , not for anything political , but just because I hate to see how excited the dads get when they find out it s not a girl . Like how fucked up is that ? Every single time , they re just a little too , like let s fucking go , you know ? Every time they see that blue confetti , they react like Maury just told them , you are not the father . Like someone s got a camera , they re like , yeah , let s go . They re way too excited . It s also weird when I tell you guys that I m trans because I can actually see everyone s reactions . </s> <s> I can see all your faces and that s weird . Like the second I tell you , like half of you guys look surprised and that actually makes me feel really good about myself . But the other half of you are looking at me like , knew it . All right , you laughed a little too hard at that . You guys look at me like you re a judge on the mask singer , you know ? Like I knew it , I knew it since the pilgrim joke . It s fucked up . And then there s always just one , then there s always just one person staring at me like , so you re not JoJo Siwa ? You can laugh at that . I look like JoJo Siwa if she just never danced . Do you know how hard that was for me when she came out as gay ? That was the worst day , like I was happy for her . I was like , good for you , okay ? But that was horrible for me . It was like , that was basically what made me transition , okay ? She came out as a lesbian and I was like , well , guess I have to be a man now . Cause I m really just one rainbow bow away at this point . So I m just kidding . Trans is not a choice , it s not a choice . It s so weird to me that people think trans is a choice . Like that s very bizarre to me . Like you think I was just living my nice cushy life as a diesel dyke in 2023 ? And then I just woke up one day and was like , you know what feels like a good idea ? If I just became a straight white dude , that feels like it d be a fun time . Just turn in my Volvo SUV , you know , go from there . It s not a choice , trans is not a choice . And anyone thinks that trans is a choice , I don t believe you ve ever been into a men s bathroom . Okay ? You think I would choose that life ? It is disgusting in there . And I have to use the stall , right ? And it s so scary , cause you know , every time I m in there , I m so scared . I have to , I don t feel like I have the quad strength to be holding up the whole time , you know ? And I m so scared of touching that disgusting toilet seat . I have to build an entire nest every time I just wanna take a piss . You guys know what you meant , no one s talking about nesting , we have to be in there . Nesting , you gotta build a whole nest cause I don t have the quad , I m up there , it s like so scared . Every time I take a piss , I m one toilet seat away from getting monkey pox , okay ? This is not a choice , nobody would choose this . And what sucks is I have to use the stall , you know ? I have to use the toilet , which is terrible because every time I go into the stall , it looks like I m that dude that s pooping in the club . </s> <s> And nobody wants to be the dude pooping in the club , okay ? So every time I go in there , I just pretend I m doing cocaine and said , I m just like , nope , not pooping , just doing lines , building a nest . Everything s fine , go around . Shit s not a choice , it s not . And it s weird too , it s weird being a trans guy , again , I ve only been transitioning about a year or so now . Sometimes I ll even forget that I m trans , like I even just forget that I m a dude now , it s the weirdest thing . Like I was doing shows in the South recently , not a good idea , let s just start there . Let s just , by the way , the room went silent , I mean , I m still here , so it s okay . I was , I hit up this liquor store after the show and it was a very , there s a weird thing about the , it was in Atlanta , the weird thing about Atlanta is that you could be in the nicest neighborhood , you take one wrong corner and you re like , the fuck is this , okay ? That was in this weird liquor store and some guy came in and he started screaming at this security guard in there and they re yelling , he s creating this whole fight , so I just start minding my business . And all of a sudden I hear , hey , big guy , big guy . And I m thinking , please don t let me be big guy . Please don t let me be big guy . And then I hear , big guy , I m like , fuck , I m definitely big guy . So just as like , to muster up all my courage , I just turn to him , I m like , yeah ? He goes , do you need help finding anything ? And I was like , no , I m all good , thank you so much . I was just looking for the Tito s , thank you . Big guy , I ll tell you what though , there s nothing more gender reaffirming than big guy , you know ? That s how you know you re fitting in , like , hey , slugger , champ , but big guy . That s how you know you ve made the club , all right ? Cause someone calls you big guy , they re like , hey , big guy , you don t know what you re gonna get into . You re like , am I about to get in a fight ? Am I gonna move a piano ? I don t know . But I m gonna answer the call , you know ? The other day I was at Costco and some old lady was there , she was like , excuse me , you seem like a big guy , can you help me get the dog food ? I was like , yeah , how many packs you need ? That was like my moments , okay ? I had a boner the whole time , little transponer , I was like , let s go . </s> <s> What do you need , three , four , five ? Cause as a woman , you never wanna be big girl , you know ? Imagine if that was like a switch scenario , I m in Costco and someone s like , hey , big girl , can you help me get the dog food ? That s just gonna ruin your whole month , you know ? You never wanna be big girl . Oh yeah , she calls big girl . She ll move a piano . It s weird cause I ve been on T for about a year now and all I ve done is grow the spormits from mustache . And half the time I m so fucking , I don t even know if I m just hungry or horny , you know ? It s confusing , but most times , either way it usually feels like a hot dog would help . See , that s a weird joke , but you guys laugh anyways . I don t even know what it means , but we like it . So I live in LA now , which is a great place to be for a trans guy , cause you could be anything you want in LA , anything you want , except for fat , but anything else , you can be it . Yeah , I gained so much weight on testosterone , I thought they were gonna kick me out of this city . They re gonna be like , sir , ma am , sir , you gotta go . You could stay close by , but not here . Maybe try Anaheim , I don t know . But you can t stay here . Yeah , I do like it here though . I love LA , but LA is also the worst , right ? It s the best city in the worst city . LA really pisses me off . The other day I saw recently that the LA Animal Shelters were posting that they were at max capacity , okay ? They re at max capacity . And so they were like , look , we re gonna do 50 off for all dog adoptions , 50 off for cats , and 75 off for other . So I took the bait , okay ? I perused this other category . Bunch of bunny rabbits , couple of sea turtles , and then I m looking , I swear to God , I see it listing for a gray pigeon . A gray pigeon , okay ? And they had a photo of this guy and everything , and he s like in the corner like , what the fuck ? Let me out of flight in New York , it could be a normal pigeon , I swear . I ll never shit on anyone again . Like here s an idea for your max capacity problems . Have you tried just opening up the gates ? Okay , just let them on free . Cause like first of all , if you go to the Animal Shelter to adopt a pigeon , you re a fucking serial killer . </s> <s> And second of all , only in LA , right ? Only in LA does somebody see a pigeon on the ground and think , oh , somebody lost this . Like what was the process there ? Did you scan them for a chip ? Like a who , who , did you hang flyers ? Do you see me trying to who ? My voice can t go that high . Where are my other trans dudes at ? Whoa , can t happen . Fucking weird place LA , it is . But again , I gotta be here as a trans boy . Big boys gotta live in LA . I feel like my whole family too , as a trans guy , a lot of trans people don t have like , their families aren t that accepting . I ve got the best family ever . My family is awesome , they re very cool . Yeah , thank you . My family is very cool . The only people I feel for , I ve got two nephews and a young niece . And my niece , her whole life , I ve just been Uncle Abe . So it s nothing different . But my nephews , it s a little strange . Like my oldest nephew is 15 . So he s a fucking asshole . He s a fucking asshole , okay ? And they ve known me before , so they re like , the fuck ? But they re cool . And so when they came out to visit me about a year ago , right when I first started transitioning , I had just started T . So I didn t quite look like this yet . I still had titties , let s be honest . And my hair was even more bleach blonde than this . So I was looking like feminine , okay ? And they came out , my two nephews came out to visit me and I was thinking , I m gonna take them to Disneyland for their first time and I ll be the cool uncle and they re gonna love me . So I was so excited . So they come out and we go to Disneyland . And as we re going in , I noticed , as they re taking everyone s tickets , if you re a boy , they say , welcome , Prince . And if you re a girl , your journey awaits , Princess . Like everybody is Prince or Princess . And I m like , oh boy , this should be interesting . I look over , my nephew s already noticed what s going on . He s amped up , he s like , ha , ha , ha . Go ahead , give him your ticket , the snow of the way in . I don t know why he sounds like an old Jewish man in my head , but he s a fucking asshole , okay ? </s> <s> So they both go through , right this way , Prince , thank you , Prince . And the guy sees me and he s like , oh shit . And suddenly we re in this together , you know ? I m like , don t fuck this up for us . You got one shot , one opportunity , mom s spaghetti , let s fucking go . So he s all nervous , I m all nervous . And then he just looks at me and goes , welcome , Jedi . So you hear that nephew of a fucking Jedi . </s>"

Sometimes you got a little outfit on , you re excited . You re like , yeah , let him murder me . You know , it s cool . Sometimes it feels good . Sometimes it feels really bad . I ve got a new move for you for when it doesn t feel good . This is foolproof . Okay ? A guy s hitting on you . You don t want to talk to him . You re walking on the street . He hollars at you . Makes you take your little air pot out or whatever the hell . And you just turn around and you go , oh , I m so sorry . I don t have any change . He will lose . He s fucking mine . Okay ? They hate it . I ve just started keeping like pocket posties in my back pocket . I m like , that s all . Just the flashlight today , sir . Sorry for your loss . God bless you . God bless you . I do like being hit on in California . It s different than being hit on in the South . I don t know if anybody s ever experienced that before . They just kind of say whatever , you know ? The last time that I got hit on in Tennessee , I m walking down the street in my hometown . This man in a truck pulls up . All right ? He rolls down his window . He did it like this because it was the 1940s . He rolls down his window and he just goes , bam ! I have some stupid diddies . It s a bit more mean than it is horned , don t you think ? Look at those dumb ass diddies . I bet those diddies had to study twice as hard as the other diddies in their class . Look at those university of Phoenix , DeVry , ass diddies you got , girl ? Those diddies had to read what their finger just sounded out . I love being from the South . I learned new things about Tennessee all the time . I was on the phone with my mom the other day . She told me something I didn t know . She goes , Lauren , did you know that Tennessee s state drink is milk ? Is that the sickest shit you ve ever heard in your entire life ? I think the only thing funnier than our state drink being milk is that that was decreed in 2009 . Stinky was odd . We re in the midst of the biggest financial crisis any of us will ever see . Whoever first black president in the Tennessee General Assembly is just like , y all know what I can t stop thinking about right now . </s> <s> Shoot ! Just a big honking glass of 2 . Okay ? On a hot summer s day . Stinky . I m a fantastic mother . I talk to my mother every day . Who s got a good mom out there ? All right . Good for you . Well adjusted crowd . I love my mom so much . I hope you guys don t get mad at me for this or think I mean , good moms , best thing you can have in your entire life , right ? They teach you your values , teach you right from wrong , teach you how to treat people . They are kind of desperate though . You know what I mean ? The woman is obsessed with me . Okay ? The way that your mom feels when she sends you a text is the way that you feel when you text someone you want to have sex with . That s exactly the same feeling . You know , send the risk . You want to put it down right away . She s like , oh , hope she hits me back . She s so cool . You know ? 10 minutes go by . She s like , she s probably texting other moms . Shit . Why wouldn t she be ? She s so hot . You get a good mom on the phone ? Forget about it . You re never getting off the phone . I ve been on the phone with my mom for the past 85 years . She s on hold right now . At the end of a phone conversation , my mom starts to sound like a comedian who s having a bad set . She s just like , all right . What else ? What else ? What else ? Let s see . What did I want to talk about ? What s in the news ? She s just flipping through a notebook . Is this my name and hearts over and over again ? She s got her little legs kicked up behind her . She s so horny for me . It s insane . That woman will say absolutely anything to keep me on the phone . The other day we were on our 19 with phone conversation . I was like , mom , I have to go . I have a life . And she goes , I m pregnant . Listen . It s yours . I m keeping it . Look at the hell . You got a hysterectomy . Thanks for laughing at my mom s hysterectomy . She s doing well . I ve been trying to get a little better mentally this year . I got medicated this past year , you guys . Yeah . Thank you so much . I don t want to do a whole like PSA thing for you . If you feel like you need an 80 you do . You are a burden to your family and friends .

LAUGHTER I have been doing a little bit better mentally . I m not supposed to drink on any depressants . I m a pretty big drinker . Hard getting energy . It is not my fault that I chose a job that you can be good at while you re drunk . OK ? I didn t make the rules about that . There are only like three jobs like that . It s like comedy , working at a bowling alley , and being a dad . Those are the only three things . Am I wrong ? You can have a pretty chilled drunk dad . Drunk moms do not have that luxury , too . They , drunk mom never looks good . She s always like swaying in the corner to a Billy Joel song . You know , she s like , ah . She s accidentally ashing into her shard and a . You know what I mean ?

You guys are all about dogs here , because I have a dog . She s disabled . Her back legs don t work , so she s in a little wheelchair . Super cute . Super hard to get catcalls when you re walking a disabled dog . People will stop and talk to me , though . They ll go , oh my god , God bless you . This is so nice of you . God bless you . And I m just like , how do you know that I didn t do that to her ? I m like a Republican dad . I m like , she was acting out , you know what I mean ?

And then people will stare at my dog in a wheelchair , and they ll be like , oh my god , she s so fucked up . That s crazy . How does she go to the bathroom ? I m like , I have to squeeze her like a Capri Sun . You want to ask her the same thing , are we good ? I m also , I m Gen Z , so I went through the dare program . Did you guys go through ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , it works , right ? We re all good . I never done drugs . I remember , like , they didn t do it right . I remember sitting there , and they were like , don t do drugs . And definitely do not huff bleach . I was just sitting there like , I didn t know you could huff bleach . I m not gonna huff bleach , okay ? They brought a school bus to my school . They decorated the inside like a mouthful of cancer . And they re like , yes , this is what happens when you re an adult . Which we know , that s not what happens . They should do more realistic adult shit to scare us . Like , we should walk onto the school bus , and they should be like , turbo tax . </s> <s> Figure that shit out , okay ? I feel like they didn t teach us anything realistic about being an adult . Like , they spent so much time in health class teaching us about STDs . Like , I ve had enough sex to know that s not real .

Like , no one said when you re an adult , like , you don t necessarily want to kill yourself tomorrow . But every time you get behind a car wheel , you re just like , wouldn t it be crazy if I crashed this car ? Wouldn t that be fucking nuts ? And your passenger s like , yeah , are you gonna crash this car ? I didn t know , but that would be fucked up , right ? That would be a good passenger .

Yeah , who s straight ? Don t whew for that . That is homophobic . You piece of shit . Okay , the rest of you didn t answer straight , but watching gay porn for sure . I tell people I m queer and they ll be like , what does that mean ? And I m like , oh , it means I ll date anyone . And they re like , oh , so you date Hitler ? You know those people ? Like in middle school , I said I was against a death penalty and some girl was like , oh , so you wouldn t kill Hitler ? I was like , no , I m like 13 . And that guy has like an army . So also I m Jewish , but like that s not why I wouldn t date Hitler . I don t like dudes with mustachees . Girls are really into that now . They ll see like an ugly dude by his mustache and they ll be like , he s so fucking hot . And I m like , yeah , he s literally Hitler . I was also like a really homophobic towards myself before I came out . Like before I claimed I was straight and I d make out with women and be like , this is just for fun . </s> <s> But now I ve embraced it . So I m like , this is serious business . This pussy serious , okay ? First time I hooked up with a woman , she tried kissing me good morning , the next morning . And I was like , bro , are you fucking gay ? What are you doing ? Also people think scissorsing doesn t exist . It exists . It s just like so hard to do . Oh my God . I have never felt more like gay people shouldn t have rights than when I was trying to get into that position . I was like , okay . Yeah , God did not intend this for us . At all . But like , I still like to date straight men because like , I like watching them learn things . I was dating a guy . His face was so dry he was molting like a rattlesnake . I was like , oh , here s some lotion . And he s like , babe , you changed my life . And I m like , I act like a girl . I m like , yeah , there s lotion everywhere . So I don t even know like , what he was doing before me . Like he didn t cook meals . I don t know how he fed himself . He was just like in trash cans like a raccoon , which makes sense because that s how he ate me out . He s just dumps her diving . It s not a joke about my pussy having garbage , by the way . It s about him not making me come . Okay . Also , okay , I lived out of a car for a year in the fun way . But not like in the TikTok way , you know what I mean ? They re like , build this van for only 100 , 000 in your parents driveway . I m like , get a house , you idiot . No , I like piston buckets , okay . Growing up , my mom was like really in a gender role . She s like , a man should be in the house to do things . Women shouldn t have to do that stuff . And I always thought those really messed up . And then I lived out of a car and I d do stuff on my own . And I was like , yeah , men should do these things . Honey , come clean my piss bucket . Yeah . Also , every time I suck dick , I feel like a war hero coming home from war . I go home , I look in the mirror and I m like , Kylie , you fucking , you suck that dick , okay ? Or America . Because sucking dick and being a war hero is the same thing . We both can t explain why we re there . We re there for like way too many years . And we started young hoping it would pay for our college . Sometimes I m down there so long I m drafting a letter home to my family . I m like , dearest family , rations have been running low . </s> <s> But morale is high . Just kidding , he just bombed inside my mouth . You guys are pussies . When I was 14 , I read in the magazine and it said , when you re sucking dick , make noise . So they know you like it . Mmm , yummy dick . It s not blooming onion , it s dick . I didn t use a gift card for this shit , okay ? </s>"

        "transcript": "<s> I always like picking up the vibe before I begin my set , because what I can do is I can look at an individual or a group of people , rate your vibe , and then match it . I am a vibrator . LAUGHTER Now I tell you that because I want to be honest with you all . This past August , my positivity was put to the test when I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin s lymphoma . And I m going to spend the next few minutes making fun of cancer . Because . . . APPLAUSE . . . Kemo , that s just medicine . Real therapy is a shared experience with a group of people laughing together at the same time . APPLAUSE So understand , if you don t find this material funny , you are actively killing me . LAUGHTER When I found out I was going to have to do chemotherapy , I immediately signed up for talk therapy . And I was a little too honest on my evaluation form about my recreational drug use . Because they assigned me a substance abuse counselor . Not what I need . I m very good at doing drugs . This outfit did not put on itself . The way I discovered this in our very first meeting , she s going through the checklist , and she asked me point blank , did you smoke crack in July ? No , I have never smoked crack , and I would not mark on a form that I did . She said , well , you checked a box that asked if you used crack slash cocaine . Oh . LAUGHTER Well , that slash is carrying a lot of weight . You need to separate those items . It s one thing to hit the slopes when a batch of fresh powder drops . But when the snow melts and it turns to rocks , get off the mountain . LAUGHTER Soon you ll be skiing right under a bridge . LAUGHTER It took three months of testing to figure out what type of cancer I had , and that was the worst part not knowing . But eventually , it came down to two possible options . It was either stage four , head and neck cancer , very bad , or stage three , Hodgkin s lymphoma , bad , but much more curable . And when my doctor found out it was the latter , he presented me this information in a very peculiar way . He walked in the room and said , Mr . Hooper , this is what we were hoping for . LAUGHTER LAUGHTER We were ? I felt like you walked in the room and went , it s cancer , baby ! LAUGHTER I wasn t hoping for this . If we re hoping for things , I was hoping chocolate ice cream would have the same nutritional value as kale . I was hoping people would stop filming entire concerts with their phones while they stand in front of me . </s> <s> I wasn t hoping I had swollen lymph nodes . I was hoping a nymphus swallow my looks . LAUGHTER We have different dreams . LAUGHTER My oncology team was wonderful . Except one thing , my main oncologist had a winking problem . LAUGHTER And it would come out at very inappropriate times . When I was diagnosed , he looked at me and said , you re young , you re healthy , we re going to get you through this , I promise . LAUGHTER Is the air try in here ? Can you hold your eyes open while you tell me life affirming information ? I don t want anyone winking at me ever . If my wife on our wedding day during our vow said , till death do us part , LAUGHTER What do you know that I don t ? LAUGHTER Now , I m happy to report that one month ago I had a pet scan and asked for now there is no more cancer . CHEERING CHEERING There s plenty of other shit wrong with me , but cancer is not one of them . But here comes the fun part , everybody . My medical bills just started arriving . And I m going to tell you two real bills I opened back to back . The first one ? 242 , 000 . The second one ? 116 , 000 . And I opened those , looked at them , and just went , LAUGHTER That s not real money . You might as well have told me that I owe six unicorn horns and three norwales because clearly we are fronking through the rainbow forest of imagination land . If they had told me that I owe 19 , 600 , I d be terrified because that s actual money that would cripple me . But 350K ? Sure ! TAKEN ! In fact , walk outside in your office right now , I m flying around on a magic carpet , dropping saxophone all over the city . Maybe one of them will hit you . LAUGHTER 350 , 000 . I m not worried about it . I m not . Because here s what they don t tell you about medical bills , everyone . They re fake . You don t have to pay those . See , if I don t make my car payment , somebody will come and repossess my car . What s the hospital going to do ? Repossess my health ? What are you going to do , hospital ? Are you going to send big , scary guys after me to break my legs so I end up back in your hospital and don t pay those bills ? LAUGHTER Has anyone here ever been in a staggering amount of medical debt ? Clap your hands if you ever have been . OK , right over here , how much was it if you don t mind me asking ? 200 , 000 . Did you pay it ? LAUGHTER No ! Of course you did it because they re fucking fake ! You don t have to pay those . She s sitting on a comedy show on a Monday night without a car in the world ! Nothing s going to happen to you ! </s> <s> LAUGHTER Now , people have argued with me about this . One person said , that s not true . They will take your house . What house ? LAUGHTER I m a millennial in California . I can barely afford to listen to house music . LAUGHTER Someone else said they will garnish your wages . OK , one problem . I don t have a job . I get paid in drink tickets . Do you want me to tear one in half and we can split a vibe because so , no ? Now , I think we can all agree . It s never a good time to get cancer . But my timing was particularly nefarious because my wife and I were in the process of trying to start a family . And so she rushed me to a fertility clinic so I could free sperm before I started chemo . Now , I have to tell you , my wife was already very concerned about my virility because I ve smoked pot pretty much every day for 23 years . She does not smoke weed . So she read an article that said , if you get stoned all the time , then your sperm are also getting high and they might get distracted and not know where to go . As if my sperm are going to be on their mission to fertilize her egg and then one of the front goes , what ? Fish is doing three nights at the labia ? Turn around everybody . We go this way now . Only one gets in the clam , but tonight we all get to jam . Then the calm trips down her leg for 28 minutes longer than you thought it was going to . Is that still the same road ? If you ever have to go to a fertility clinic , I ll let you know this . They do not appreciate humor at all . The nurse gave me a plastic cup and a brown paper bag and I said , oh , I don t need the bag . I m dining in . I got nothing from this woman . It s 9 . 30 in the morning . She already had a better joke than that . Next day , Dr . calls me and I m a little nervous , but he starts the conversation by saying , Mr . Hooper , your sperm , it s unbelievable . Go on . He said , a normal sample of your size on the low end , we re looking for 30 million sperm . You had 390 million . And I heard that number and thought , is that dangerous ? That sounds like way too many . It s gotta be crowded in there . That means if you re a normal man with a regular level of testosterone , between your legs , there is a gorgeous farmhouse on 60 acres . The crops are harvesting . There s horses running by a lake at sunset . </s> <s> It s serene , it s majestic . I have section eight housing happening down here . There s just millions of families crammed together , stacked on top of each other . When I finally do impregnate my wife , where it s gonna get down to all the other survivors and they re gonna be like , no way . No one s ever made it out of this hood . If Ronnie made it , we can all make it . This is what we were hoping for . Now here s what I can t stop thinking about . For the last 10 years , my wife has had an IUD and intro utorant device . We ve never once had a pregnancy scare . Think about the workload , that little piece of copper put in over that decade . It should have retired on day two . This was not a single use revolver . This was an AK 47 just blasting kids , just , I swear , where in our OBGYN removed it , she took it out and said , I ve never seen one dented before . What did you do to this thing ? That IUD stopped billions of my bullets over the years . It was the last line of defense . It reminded me of that one security guard at the January 6th insurrection that didn t abandon his post . Everybody else fled the building . A one guy was like , no way ! No one s getting in here today ! You with the horns ! Back up , feel the desk ! That IUD was hodor . Millions of fiery demons are blasting through that tunnel , hellbent on destroying civilization , and one guy is on the other side , and , oh , the door ! Oh , the door ! Hoya ! Hoya ! That IUD is now framed on my mantle , and I salute it every single day . Guys , I hate to tell you , but it looks like I m going to be alive for a while ! Hug your friends , I love you so much . </s>"

Never cheated . Pretty good . It s pretty good . Never cheated . It s pretty good . It s pretty good . Also , never been offered . So it s pretty easy . I would . I don t even like her . Honestly , I am actively trying . I just know what he s taking the bait . You know ? No , number one reason I don t cheat is I love my wife . But also , I just . . . I want to be a good guy . And I don t think I honestly always have been . I grew up around a lot of toxic masculinity and it got projected on to me a lot because I m a bigger guy . I m 65 . I have a deep voice .

I don t want to just point the finger though . I wanted to do a better job of holding myself accountable for when I ve been a part of the problem because we all have . I grew up in the 90s and the 2000s . I know I have . I m not trying to be edgy . I m just being honest . I grew up in that crazy era where we called everything gay . Don t lie . I know you did . I m from Canada and we did . I know you guys did . I ve read a history book . I know you guys did . We didn t even have freedom . We were doing it . I know you guys were doing it with all the freedom . With all the freedom Eagles soaring in the sky all the time . Those freedom amendments of yours I know you were doing . I m not condoning it . I feel terrible . It s very ignorant . I feel really bad for the actual gay kids that impacted but at the time that didn t stop us from calling literally everything gay . I didn t even have to be people . Concepts were gay . So I want to be like , hey man you want to go swimming and other guys like nah swimming is gay and everyone s like that s a perfectly valid reason to not go swimming . </s> <s> Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Swimming is a pinch . Gay come to think of it . We better steer clear . A couple alpha male nine year olds like us . We have an image to maintain on these streets of Edmonton Alberta , Canada . We can t partake such cuckery like swimming that would be ridiculous . It s true . Everything was gay . I was gay . My dad , gay . Every man I ever met growing up was gay for some reason . Because that s all I meant to be a man . As you sit there you call things gay then you get called gay and the cycle repeats forever and you bottle it up so you don t snap because if you snap they re all going to call you gay . But then you end up snapping because you bottled it up and you were gay the whole time there was nothing you could do . It wasn t tough spot where the last thing you wanted to be called was gay and there was literally nothing you could do that wasn t going to make you gay . You get caught reading a book . Mac got braces he was gay . Chris tried out for volleyball gay . Colin was dating Cheryl most of the guys like Cheryl . Colin was the gayest guy in all of Canada . We told Colin all the time . I m from Alberta , Canada . That s like the cowboy oil rig tough guy province . If you had a vegetable if you got caught eating a vegetable is a better way of saying that if you got caught eating something with a vitamin in it . All the old guys in their denim tuxedo is like , it s rabbits food . What are you doing son ? Be a man . Be a man . He is steak . Be a straight man . He is steak . Put a nice thick juicy piece of meat in your mouth like a straight man . Ditch the salad . I m the youngest of four brothers when I was 13 I wrote a poem and they found it . I ve been a witness protection ever since . I haven t seen my family in 20 years . I didn t move to the States . I was relocated . I had no choice . All because I tried to express myself creatively when I was a child . I was like , what s lazy hypocrites would go around calling everything gay and then that same night we d have a sleep over . What are we doing ? It s a very romantic notion . Essentially what we re saying to each other is listen man . I like being with you so much that even when we sleep I think it s best that we re together . I really do . I want to start tomorrow morning off right . I want to be looking at you the literal second I open my eyes because God this connection we have is special and I just love you so much . </s> <s> I want to do everything with you . That s nice . I feel like guys should be able to express that to one another . You can t say anything even closer that you can t say anything . I would make this mistake at a sleepover . I would just say good night . I would get verbally tired and feathered for saying good night . Sleepover with a bunch of guys in Alberta Canada . I just be like , how good night guys . You re like , oh don t be gay . That s what did it was me saying good night . That s what tarnish this otherwise oozing machismo bravado filled event was me saying good night . Look at the buildup . Look at where we are . This has been a dance of seduction . We ve been courting each other . We ve been courting each other . We made plans on Monday . This is literally all I ve been able to think about . I have been losing sleep with anticipation for this night . I spent a lovely afternoon through evening with one another . I m way further with this dude . I d ever been with a girl . Sleepin in the same bed in our boxers . The water bed . There s a lava lamp on . There s a lava lamp on next to my head . But that s fine . It s that I said good night . The lava lamp . That s fine . It s a couple guys . A couple guys . A couple bulls . A couple bulls lock and horns . Just a couple guys . We might lock horns . There s a distinct possibility . Because at some point tonight we re going to be face to face , breath to breath , completely erect . So that is a distinct possibility . We would project weakness on the things that just aren t weak . We d make fun of male cheerleaders . Have you ever seen a male cheerleader up close in the flesh ? It s horrifying . It s like when you see a moose in the woods . It s like my god , this year , this year size of this beast . It s magnificent . Male cheerleaders , man . Don t sleep on them . Built like a fridge , stallion , thoroughbred . Just doing standstill backflips because he s in the mood . This guy has a train to SaaS . This is a problem out on the streets . Guys are so wakener that here dudes a male cheerleader like , pansy , kick that guy s ass . A male cheerleader would destroy me . If I ever got in a fight with him , we wouldn t even have to throw a punch . He s grabbing me , flippin me like 18 feet in the air . Couple steps back , not catch me . What am I gonna do ? It s game over . I m a heap on the floor he s thrown in all these cocky little victory dances just to taunt me . What a dick . Male cheerleading is some of the most toxic masculinity you re ever gonna see in your life . Just some way over the top unnecessarily yoked up dude , literally throwing women around . Man , this guy s such a boss . Look at those glutes . </s> <s> Unreal . I joke about things . I joke about things . Really though I hate ignorance . I hate ignorance of all kinds . And homophobia the most . This isn t to be preachy , but it hits really close to home because I joke about how my brother s made fun of me . Then you get older , you mature . Life happens . And it just homophobia hits really close to home because one of my brothers is gay . So , yeah . I think he s gay . I tell him to be gay . Ah ! Get out of here in a sec . I try and be a progressive guy . I don t know how much longer I m gonna be . And that s not because my politics are changing . It s just the world s changing so fast . I think that s how it works . You think you have the right idea than a few decades later you re a barbarian . That s how it goes . And we re not gonna be immune to that . That s gonna happen to us . And I worry what s gonna be the thing that makes me the old angry white guy I grew up around but never want to be . I think I know . Robots are here . Cyborgs . Yeah , cyborgs are coming . I m not making this up . Some people are already advocating for robot rights . Scary . So , what if I have a daughter in 30 years she s coming home telling me how she s marrying a man droid or something like that . Now , all of a sudden I m the old angry white dad . It s like , no . No , no , no , no . I don t think so . Not a chance . Not in a million years . My little girl is not marrying one of them . I don t think so . Well , she s telling me I m robophobic . What if I m a robophobic ? What if I m a robophobic ? If robophobic is a thing , I m going to be a rampant robophobic . I m not . I m not gonna be a closet robophobic . I m not doing the whole look both ways . Wow , I m not robophobic . But , no , no , no , no . The only thing you re gonna know about me is that I m robophobic . Huge part of my brand . I m gonna be calling them robos and things like that . Fuck those robos . I can t stand them . I m gonna have all sorts of robophobic gear , like shirts and hats and flags in my truck that say no robo and stuff like that , you know ? I was fucking robos stealing all of our jobs . Fucking a park economy . I hate them . It s goddamn robos . That s gonna be the thing . That makes me the old angry white guy . I m just sitting around pissed all the time . </s> <s> Nothing s even happened . I m just like , I can t have any fun anymore . I can t do anything . PC , please . I can t do anything . I can t watch RoboCop anymore because he s just copped . Everybody shits a brick . I can t do the robot at weddings anymore because it s cultural appropriation . What if that s like the most problematic thing you can do 20 years from now ? Full body robot . There s gonna be video surfacing and me just lighten it up at my buddies wedding . It s so problematic . It s gonna be like the 2050 s watered down version of Blackface or something . It s just over for me because I did full body robot . No career aspirations from here on out .

But when you leave weed for eight years , they change the game , you know ? They got weed , everything . They got weed shampoo . Look at this glorious right there . They got weed chapstick . I m wearing too much right now . They have weed water now . That s not a joke . They have weed lacrosse and a can . However you say that dumb beverage , I don t know what a pamphle mousse is , all right ? It s great fruit . But I was at a party and they had a cooler full of it , and I started putting them back , you know ? I didn t know . I had about eight , nine , 10 of them , bitches . I m also lying . I knew . You put a little in your tooth hole on the side . It gets rid of ginger virus . And then I smoked a joint after that , because I m an addict , you know ? That s my problem . Like , I don t like regular high . I like , oh no . How can I survive this ? And therein lies my problem . And then I did all that , and I was driving me on my buddy home on the freeway . And he asked me , he s like , how the fuck are you driving right now ? And I said , I m not . We re flying , bro . That car ride was lit , too . We have pink Floyd plane , you know ? And hello , hello , hello . Is there anybody in there ? No . I lost my marbles when I was nine , dude . I was that little kid high on tropical punch coolade with the red stained lips . Remember Red Mouth ? I was a bad kid . I was a minis . My mama put a leash on me . I was a leash kid . That shit didn t work . She turned around . I was like , watch , strap that shit on another kid . I was gone , baby . That big booty can t catch thing . My mama s got a big old booty . That s it . That s a one liner right there . I m half Mexican . Can you tell ? At all ? Boquita ? For the daughters . What s up now ? What s up now ? My mama is full Mexican . My dad is white as fuck . So I came out looking like a lesbian . I shaved my pussy today , boy . </s> <s> I make fun of my Mexican side a lot . And they re like , why don t you make fun of your white side cradle ? Why don t you make fun of them ? It s because I can t . What am I going to say about my uncle Terry white side ? He s doing well . Yeah . He s an engineer . He s a son of a bitch on the golf course . That shit don t slap . But my uncle Johnny , a Mexican side , watch how full this fool s nuts . That fool s tied it up . He s got a punk and kill . Tadadon is knuckles right here . And then he has Jesus Christ on his throat . Yeah , make up your mind , Johnny . Those are conflicting ideologies , bro . But he s a baby , send me and tell me stories when he used to party . He s sober now . You re about to hear what ? Yeah . But he said he had PCP at a party and his buddy warned him . He s like , hey , Johnny , he stashed the drugs . And the cops are coming . And he said he pulled it out of this pocket and he put it into that pocket . And then he s like , stashed it . And then he went to prison , yeah . And then became my babysitter in that order . It all makes sense now . I got you guys want a weird story . I got a weird one . Hey , man , I see my cousins vagina before . You said , yeah . That s consent , baby . No , I saw it in a natural way , in a normal way . My cousin was pregnant as fuck . And her man got locked up . He was a tweaker from Riverside . And my mother is a very sweet lady . She s a matriarch . She takes everybody in . And she s like , we got you , come and live with us . But now I am home alone with my pregnant cousin . And she went into labor . Yeah . And she s like , hey , can you take me to the hospital right now ? And I was like , OK , doke , doke . But let me smoke this weed real quick . I m not a woman . But I don t know how long labor is going to be . It s a long day . And let me get my mind right . So I rush to the hospital . And when I was me , my cousin and the doctor , and then he asked me , says , do you want to see your baby being brought into the world ? And I m high as fuck . I was like , hey , oh , yeah , dude . That s like national geographic in real life . And my pullout game is strong . I don t know when the next opportunity like this is going to happen . And I know it s weird . I asked my cousin s permission . I was like , can I witness childbirth ? And she green lights me . And she s like , yeah , give it a look . </s> <s> And I was like , OK , doke , doke . And now her legs are in the stirrups , the clampy thanks . And I m just staring at it and still staring at it . And nothing is happening . And then I look at the doctor . I m like , hey , he s like , oh my god , I m so sorry . It was too soon . So I stare at my cousin s vagina for no reason at all , bro . I know it was only two minutes , but I m high as hell . Like two years to me . I also want to know what if that doctor had the sickest sense of humor ever ? And he s like , I m going to trick this high dumb dumb in staring at his cousin s stuff . Because he did , man , he got me . So then 20 minutes go by . And he says that the baby s crowning now come back and give it a look . And I was like , I don t know , bro . Fool me once . Shame on you , dude . Fool me twice . That s my cousin s pussy , bro . Well , I was like , oh , fuck it . I ll take a chance , you know ? And I went back and I witnessed that shit . Women , you re amazing creatures . Y all sprout human beans out your wee wee did it . That s the craziest thing I ve ever seen in my life . It comes with a cord . Y all know that . They let me cut it and everything . It s tough as nails , though . They don t warn you about that part . I had to pull out my pocket knife , go . You know ? I told y all it s mexian . We ready , dog . What s so cool ? But when you witnessed something like that , it impacts you . I saw that . And I said to myself , I was like , I m never having sex again . But then you quickly realize that s not a possibility . So you bargain , you go , OK , at least when I have sex , I ll be safe , and I ll wear a condom . But then you quickly realize that s not a possibility . So you pull out and pray , yeah . Who s getting STDs tonight ? OK . I think STDs are a myth anyways . You just go in the ocean that shit goes away . You ready ? You re burning with some burning from the Lord . My dad s crazy , too . When white side , he doesn t like laws . You know , like laws , those silly old things . I remember growing up the first law that changed was the bike helmet law . </s> <s> When I was a little kid , you could bear back the concrete , like a man . You come out like this , though . And me and my father were riding our bikes at the Mousslaunch because he had won too many the night before . And we re picking up his truck . And we pulled over by the police , and he says to us , your son has to wear a helmet now . And my father said , I ain t raising no fucking nerd . And the cop was like , oh , Jesus . This was noon on a Saturday in Torrance , California . I was like , yeah , he s a firecracker , try living with him . And then the next law that changed , used to be able to ride in the back of pickup trucks . Even in liberal Los Angeles , early 90s , that s where to go . Me and my sisters would be back there playing Uno and hopscotch . You hit it there , and be like , whoo . That might have been a good law . Let s save some ninos right there . Ooh , that goes another . And we were going fishing , and we re going down the 110 freeway . And we get pulled over . And me and my sisters are back there playing . And the police says , like , sir , your children cannot be back there anymore . And my father said , what is happening to America ? My children can play in my pickup on a highway I pay taxes for . And the cop , you know , he s like , so we re just trying to prevent you from having a dead son . And my father said , I d rather have a dead son than a pussy boy . And then he beat me . I said , dark one . OK , my bad . We ll prep it up . We ll go happy . I moved to the beach recently . Hey . I looked like I would live by the beach , just not in the home , you know ? Like , baby , a van at best . Or under the pier on a rough night . And I was babysitting my little nephew . Again , I m 10 years off in narcotics in alcohol . I ll be back down the plow that . So she trusts me again . I take my little nephew down on the ocean . I put them on a boogie board . Just very shallow in the white water . And I don t know what God is mad at me from a Kool Aid days or druggy days or what . But that full send a wave in out of nowhere . And then my nephew disappeared . Yeah , I don t know if you ve ever lost a kid in the Pacific Ocean . But that s a bad feeling right there . </s> <s> Yeah , I only lost them for like three seconds . It was the longest three in my life . I was searching for his head to pop up like a buoy . I was like , come on , daddy . It s come on . And I just seen him tumble and just cry . And he s four . He can t talk that guy . He popped up . And he said , I was underwater , Uncle . And he said , I could see you . And then I couldn t see you . And I said , you re a poet , Tariya . And I don t tell your mom about this . And he didn t rat me out because he s Mexican . Yeah . And then I beat him . Generational trauma continues . I m just joking . It stops here . </s>"

I moved here from New York during a pandemic . And people like to say the New Yorkers of me , but let me take something . LA is mean too , but they just mask it in a different way . Like , I voted in the last election , and I had to do my research , because I ll be hiding shit on the ballot . It d be taking a while for you to figure out what you really saying , because you don t just say it in layman terms . You sneak it into propositions and shit . Like , there was something on the ballot that basically was like , do you hate homeless people , yes or no ? Right ? So now I m in a vulnerable feeling like , why can t you feel it s in the gladiator ? I don t know . Do I hate homeless people ? That s a lot of pressure on me . I just got here . I don t want to make those life decisions . That s too much responsibility . I feel like , so I don t want to do shit no more . I m 42 . I m ready to be dumb . I m done . I m ready to check out .

I want to be a princess . But I m late to the game because I m tall . I m six swearing . I ve been a certain set because I was 12 . And it s hard to be a princess . Especially when you grow up playing street ball . Because I ll get fouled by a grown man and I say stuff like suck my dick . And that s not really a princess . You know , unless you say it like suck my dick . I want to be a princess . But princesses have it hard when you think about it . Think about like the Disney princesses . You know , they had a rough , right ? You couldn t eat an apple without it being poisoned . You couldn t sew it out the needle being poisoned . Ariel didn t have a voice until a man kissed her . Snow White lived in a tree trunk with seven day laborers . That s a hard ass life . I don t want that line . But there s no more prince charming . There s no one night to shine in armors .

I ve been rapin and pillaging for you . Like , go take a nap , Ted , please . We got nap . Go be the little spoon you want to be , sir . You know you want to be the little spoon . White men are tired . They actually tired of patriarchy , but the thing is they don t want to give it up because they don t want to be poor , you know . That s a big conundrum . So they just complain and shit . And I know white men are tired . I know they tired because one of my good friends is the dominatrix . Yeah . And they be paying her a lot of money to fuck them up . She d be spitting on them , shitting on them , beating them up everything . Because they don t know how to feel . Because they get , you know , when you re entitled , when you talk that the world is yours , like when did you stop ? When does the power end ? Like , they just , it s insufferable . And they end up like getting consumed with this idea of being at the top of the food chain . And when that doesn t pan out for them , they end up paying a black woman for 400 , 000 and I want to kick them in the nuts . They re tired . Like , you can t tell me black men are putting a plan of black woman to pay them . That s not me don t see them no more . He s stressed out from their Ukrainian war . He just getting plowed every night . Coming up stumbling in the next press conference . Black men are tired . I get it . I m not a simple person . I m tired of being a strong black woman .

        "transcript": "<s> I had a vasectomy last year . Woo ! Woo ! Woo ! We don t all wear capes . You know what I m talking about ? Just out here . I did that because we had a kid in the middle of a global pandemic and I was like , whoa , this blows , huh ? Make sure that never happens again . We had a kid , we decided we were one and done . In our situation , we have two forms of long term birth control , two options . First one , I could get a vasectomy or the second one , she could get her tubes tied . It s like , yeah , all right . Let s just go with the one that sounds like an actual medical procedure . Like a doctor is going to do it , you know ? Not the one that sounds like birth control for balloon animals . It s insane that they call it that . They don t tie them together , by the way . My whole life , I thought there was some cartoon doctor being like , no more kids for you . It s a whole procedure dog . But it s scary , like the topic of birth control is real polarizing right now , you know ? So I told like any time it came up , I would tell people , like , yeah , I m going to give a vasectomy and everyone s like , of course you are . That ain t shit . That ain t shit compared to birth . I m like , yeah , you re absolutely right . Compared to birth , that ain t shit . But not compared to birth ? That s some shit . It just is . Someone s going to cut into my nuts . That s about , you know , that s scary . That s like the one thing I hope would never happen my whole life . I was like , surely no one s going to ever cut into those . That d be , that d just be crazy . I m obviously I m never going to pay a grown up to do that . That just would , big sell out move . It s scary , like , yes . Birth is much more painful looking , much gnarlier , much scarier . But a vasectomy is just , you know , it s also painful , scary , gnarly looking . Like those two things can exist in the same world . They re just different levels of severity , you know what I mean ? I ll put it in perspective . Let s say I m walking down the street with a body of mine . It s mine in my own business . Somebody runs up and stabs them 30 times . Just runs up like , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , they stabs them 30 times and then they stab me once . </s> <s> Still sucks I got stabbed . It was a bummer . I m bleeding , you know ? That s a vasectomy . Pretty rad my voice cracked , huh ? So I walked in for the procedure and I was nervous right away because it was much different than I thought . I walked in for the procedure . I thought it was going to be simple . I thought I was just going to stand there and they were going to sew my penis into my own belly button . Makes sense to me . I just stand there , hold it for them . They could stitch around , put some shugu , rub or cement in the holes , make sure nothing gets out , you know what I mean ? In and out like a robbery . Because then if I have an orgasm into my own tummy , I can t get pregnant . I don t have the stuff . I don t have eggs . I don t have a uterus . I got no floats , you know ? I just cycle through like the Infinity Pool at Rich People s House . It s just kind of keep going in and out . Maybe I d sweat it out on occasion and just squeeze it up , keep it pushing , you know ? Plus I d have a little handle . Wouldn t that be cool ? Make a little guitar case out of me ? I was sleeping on the couch , you desperately want me to go to brunch but you don t want to wake me up . You re like , well , just pick them up . That s a little bad dude and take them . It s not at all what they do . It s a whole thing . It s a whole procedure . I go in and the doctor sits me down . He s like , all right , we re going to make a tiny little incision in your scrotum . Pull out your vest , everyone s one by one , cut out a chunk , cauterize them . The whole time , I m just like , why are you telling me ? I m already here , you know ? Save your breath , playboy . You re spinning your wheels , honestly . Just get to cutting . And so he explains everything . He stands up and he s by the door and he goes , all right , I m going to get out of here . I want you to get naked from the waist down . I ll come back in . We ll do the whole procedure . So he gets out of there . I get naked from the waist down . Can we all just agree that naked from the waist down is the dumbest kind of naked . It s insane . I just , I look like this . I don t got a lot of arrows in the quiver . </s> <s> You know , so I just , I looked like this all the time , but I had a hat on in this particular day . I didn t know this was going to happen . So I m just standing there naked from the waist down . I was like , well , that ain t it . This is crazy . It just looked like a lost five year old . Like when you re naked , when you re naked from the waist down , it doesn t look like you took your pants off . It looks like you found a shirt , you know ? It s crazy . It doesn t look planned . It looks like I was chained up in someone s basement . I got out and I was like , happened upon a shirt and like , all right , thank God . Now on to some help . And so I thought about getting all the way naked . I was like , just take the shirt off . Keep the hat on . Meet him in the middle . It just looked like a moron . And so I started to get all the way naked . But then I stopped . I was like , no , I can t do that . If someone s expecting you half naked and you re all the way naked , now it s on you . He just comes in , Sean , why are you all the way naked ? And I d be like , well , I look pretty stupid the other way . So please cut into my scrotum . Just get that done . So I kept the shirt on like an absolute tool . And he comes back in to do the procedure , but he had another person with him . I was shook . It was a student . She was shadowing him . She was going to learn how to perform best activities . I wasn t ready for that . So it comes in . It didn t matter that she was a woman . It mattered that there was another person there . Because I felt like an absolute moron . I m just standing there , feet up in the straddles , naked from the waist down , like a total showed . And she comes in with him . She goes to the back so I couldn t see her . And then he sits down and he put on some gloves and he got his hands all sudsy . And he goes , all right , I m going to wash you real quick . That s what he said . And I don t know why I did it . But I write back at her . And so he goes , we re going to wash you real quick . And I look back at her . I go , I washed myself . So . I m not a godless lunatic . Of course , I took care of it . He can do it again . I mean , we can make sure it s double clean . </s> <s> But of course , I washed . I m having a penis operation . I washed my penis . It was the only one of these I m going to get , hopefully . So yeah , I took care of it . You know ? I m not just trouncing around with some dirty pickle . It s ready to have it operated on . I wasn t in a heated game of racquetball . Just like , whoa , holy buckets . I thought I was going to get home , but I cannot do it . So I m just going to go squinch it on down there and let this poor bastard wash up for me . Of course , I washed it . He did it anyways . He just starts washing it . And I ll tell you this , it wasn t not dope . I was fine with it . I was just sitting there like , well , you ve really rolled out the red carpet playboy . This is , I ve never had a doctor do this . And this really is loosening me up , you know ? I mean , I said they did that before every medical procedure . I had my ACL reconstructed a while back . If they would have just sat down like gentlemen , and like Sean , it looks like you tore your left ACL and your MCL . We re going to get you back walking , reconstructing . It would be good as new . Before we do that , I m just going to wash your penis real quick . See if that helps everything out . And it did . So any did the procedure . It was no big deal . Took 11 minutes . I was texting the whole time . Not it was nothing . If you re thinking about getting a vasectomy , just go do it . Stop being a dickhead . Go get it done . Guys suck so bad . So just do the one thing that you can do and get it done . I digress . That s not part of that . That s not funny about that . It was a little PSA . So he did it . Got it all done . Put a little bow on it . And I was a little more clear headed after that . So I did have a question for him . I was really interested about this . I asked him , I go , what s the most common question you get from all these dudes in here getting vasectomies ? He said , one of the most common questions he gets far and away is guys don t want to know if they re going to have the same amount of ejaculate after the procedure as they did before . Which is a wild question . I ve never cared . I ve never even cared a little bit how much comes out . I don t want anything to come out . I never have . If there s another sneaky little gizpipe in there , just cut it , get that out of there . Stop it all from , it s rude . It makes everything gross . I don t need that in my life . </s> <s> It s uncouth . I don t want to do it . I don t sit down for an amazing Thanksgiving dinner . Stuff myself and then stand up and just throw gravy everywhere . I don t want to make a mess after something rad happens . If something has to come out , if something absolutely has to come out , just put a little stick in my penis with a flag on the end that says bang . How about that ? Now . Now . </s>"

And anytime my son sees a billboard , he just like assumes it s for a TV show or a movie . And we were driving the other day , we saw billboard for a planned parenthood . And the billboard had a baby on it . And the baby had just like eaten a bunch of pasta . So it was like covered in red sauce , and it was like squeezing a meatball . The baby was a mess . And then real big and spaghetti , it just says not ready . And my son sees that and he just goes , huh , that looks like a good movie . And I was like , oh buddy , you d hate that movie . You were almost in that movie . I just didn t have the heart to go see the movie . I bought tickets twice . I just couldn t go in . Also , I think it s really like fucked up of planned parenthood to put a baby on the billboard . Because isn t there a whole thing that it s not a baby yet ? Like it shouldn t say not ready . It should say too late . So sometimes , sometimes people think I m like pro life or like really religious after that joke . And I m not , you know , I didn t choose to not get an abortion because I believe in God . You know , I chose to not get an abortion because I believe in ghosts . I just , I just , still a lot of fun to put C for the rest of my life . I really like teaching my son stuff . I really like it . You know what ? I love being a parent and I love teaching him stuff . That s my favorite part of it . And when you re a parent , you know , like every moment is a teaching moment . Sometimes even in ways I don t expect , it ll be a teaching moment . Like the other day , I was playing high to go see with my son . And my son sucks at hiding . He s so bad . Like I saw him right away . But he popped out to scare me . So I was like , ah ! Wow , buddy ! Whoa ! Oh ! That was good . That was so scary . I mean , he looks to be really confused . And he s like , I didn t actually scare you . Did I ? And I was like , no , dude , you re hiding behind a glass door . You didn t scare me . And he s like , all right , well then why did you do all of that , then ? And I was like , I don t know , man .

Well , I m glad that you told me because next time , I m going to try harder . </s> <s> And I thought to myself , good , this is a good lesson for him , right ? Like I want my son to be able to tell when a woman s faking it and then try harder . So good lesson . I really like teaching him shit . I taught him how to shit . You got a teacher kid how to shit . I potty trained my kid . I don t know if you guys know potty training is just sobriving somebody into not shitting their pants . But it s all it is . But I told my son I was like , hey , man , if you learn how to use the potty , I ll take you to Disneyland to meet Mickey Mouse . And he did it . And we went . And we waited in line to make his house for like three hours . But it was worth it . Because when it was my son s turn , he walks right up to Mickey all confidently . And he s like , hey , my name s Aiman . And I poop in the potty . And let me tell you something . Mickey went nuts . Mickey was just like , yes . He was smacking his own ass for some reason . He made my son feel so good . And we re walking away . And I ll never forget the swarocking away . My son looks up at me . And he just goes , man , I feel like Mickey really likes me . He really , really , really likes me . And it took everything inside of me not to be like , dude , he doesn t actually like you . It s just his job to make you feel special . That s what I realized that Disneyland characters are just strippers for kids . Thank you . So we waited outside until Mickey s shift was over and followed him to his car . So I m a good mom . I really like Disneyland . I like taking my son to Disney . Man , it is so hard to be a good parent at Disneyland . It is so hard to be . There are no good parents at Disneyland . It is stressful for us when you have kids . It is so much work . And it s like exhausting . And you re waiting in lines and you re walking around all day . And it s packed . And it s expensive . And kids , they re just overstimulated and jacked up on sugar all day . So they re annoying and awfully behaved . And parents , we just walk around Disneyland just see thing . I walk around Disneyland so angry under the surface . I feel like the true magic of Disneyland is that kids don t realize how close they are to getting hit for the first time . I ve never seen a kid get hit at Disneyland . I ve never seen it . But I feel like if I did , I would just be like , whoa , whoa , take that shit to six flags . Kids are going to hit in the parking lot . </s> <s> That s six flags . They re not even inside yet . I really want to have another kid . I really want to have another kid . But I just hated being pregnant . I really hated it . I just got so much crazy advice from strangers . Like this one lady , this is completely true . She walks right up to me . She put her hand on my belly . She looks deep into my eyes . And she just goes , be sure to shave your pubic hair before you give birth so the doctor can see what he s doing . I was like , no , I m not going to shave my pubes before I give birth . That s like getting a haircut before I blow my brains out . I m going to do it . That s also not how I would do it , by the way . That s not how I d kill myself . I think about it . I ve thought about it . I told my therapist that . And she was like , yeah , that s suicidal ideation . And I was like , yeah , but like everybody thinks about it sometimes . And she s like , no , they don t . It s a mental illness . I m like , yeah , but I m not going to do it . It s just like relaxing to think about . And she s like , yeah , that s it . You re ill . I know suicide makes people feel uncomfortable , but I do think that it s important to talk about . And I think we re doing a better job , talking about mental health . There s more awareness around it and less stigma , which is what people need . Like the other day , I saw an advertisement for the suicide hotline on the back of a bus , which I think is great . I do feel like that should be on the front of the bus . I actually called them and told them that , which was my second time calling . The first time I called for the regular reason . But I called the suicide hotline years ago before I had a kid . I was in a really dark place in my life . And I called as like a last ditch effort . And I spoke with this woman named Beth . And I told her , shit , I ve never told anybody . And just started talking to her about how much pain I was in and how I just really wanted it all to go away . And then in the middle of all that intensity , I heard someone in the background of the suicide hotline go , who the fuck ate my egg salad sandwich ? And then it turned out that Beth ate his sandwich . So really had to talk each other down . </s> <s> It was a real twist . It was a real twist . So I couldn t kill myself after that . And now I have a kid . I m a parent . And I can t kill myself now . Because once you have a kid , suicide s off the table . That s not how I want my son to find out what ghosting is . You know this ? This is so depressing . But you should think , I don t have a lot to live for besides my son . And he ll never know that because I can t tell him that . How does that conversation go ? Like , what am I supposed to say afterwards ? Just like , hey , buddy , you re the only thing keeping mommy alive . No pressure . No pressure . But my kid really is . He s all I have . So when he s mean to me , I want to be like , dude , I m hanging on by a thread . You re the thread . Look around . What do you think I m living for exactly ? Our shitty apartment ? The basket of unmatched socks that has been there since before the pandemic ? No , dude , you , you re it . I can t make you be nice to me , but I can make you an orphan . </s>"

Yeah , there s the whites , there s the Hispanics , you know , there s the blacks . It s always a little uncomfortable to say black , I feel like . Because you say black , everybody s like , why do you say black ? All the whites . Everybody s , here s one thing that I ve been trying to do . I ve been trying to be a little more open minded . And I feel like it s hard to do to be open minded . Like , for example , I m a straight guy . Okay , and I know that s a weird thing to be like , I m a straight guy . Like , I have a wife , she s real . And yeah , I m a straight guy . And I like all the processes . I like them , but the small ones , the big ones . I like the small ones because they re compact . If there s a zombie apocalypse , she is ready . You know , she is away from the zombies . It is the thing . I m a straight guy , it s my point . But I have a friend who is by , and because sometimes I want to be open minded , but I think to myself , how do I know that I m not a little big gay ? Like , how do I know that ? Because so I have a friend who s by , and I m not by curious , but I am curious about the buy . That is a little bit different . I just want to check the landscape of things . I m a straight guy . But I went to my friend , I was like , really masculine friend , which is not a good choice for this question . I was like , bro , how do you know you re not gay ? And he s like , bro , you should just know . I m like , yeah , but how do you know you don t like something if you ve never tried it ? He s like , bro , you re gay . You are 100 full gay . I m like , you re not listening to me . Like , how do you know you don t like something if you never tried it ? It s like oysters . Nobody has seen the oyster for the very first time . And was like , oh my gosh , this looks appetizing . Let s eat this goo in the rock . Nobody . We only started to eat oysters because we saw other people eat it . And we re like , oh my gosh , they look like they re having so much fun . Right ? Yeah . And that s why I put my finger on my ass a couple times . Because I m open minded . I m open minded , open oyster , open ass . Okay , that s gay . But I did not like it . Is the thing . I did not like it . </s> <s> Because nobody likes the oyster for the first time . You saw other people do it . A little bit of horse radish , little bit of Tabasco . And to me , that was Lou . And that s why I put it up the second time . And yeah , and I did not like it again , though . I did not like it again . So , well , if you remain a bit wild , it will make your mind leftass . Yeah , you re right . So , I think our son worrying about it . But , the meaning of our son s lovely question is bênch , when we address people , and when we address people who ask whether and when we will find out who they , how a lot of people are trying to tell that to us . And that is probably because people suggest that Indiana , and that s a super white place . Yeah , because there is the whites , and then is the whites . And there are whites . And I asked dude , super white guy , I was like , hey man , what is something that you did recently ? That s very open minded . He s like , we ll see a nation comedian . What ? What ? What ? What ? What ? What ? Some of you were scared to laugh at that real quick . But I was like , that s awesome that you said that . Because first thought was always like , oh , he s racist and bigoted . I m like , yeah , but he s also a little bit less racist than yesterday . Because if I just came , because that was his peak open minded , that was like putting a zucchini on my ass the first time . That was the peak . Like if I was going in and be like , you racist cracker , be a suspect , yeah , he would have just been like , I need you , Chinks , wasn t funny . And then I wouldn t lost a whole white community . That s why I came with the positive reinforcement . Because now he s going to go back to his barn , tell four more quats , and they re going to come to the show , and that is exposure therapy . I m doing the Lord s work . I know that exposure therapy because I do therapy . Hey , you guys , everything about killing yourself sometimes . All right , some of you are excited about it . Some people think about it , and some others don t . Some people are just really working hard to survive , and they don t even have time to be sad . And I really respect that . And some people are just healthy , mentally , financially , and physically . And if you re those people , you should definitely think about killing yourself . I m just kidding . Everybody have weak moments . It s the thing . I call the suicide hotline a couple of times . Yeah , just to figure it out , I don t know solutions just to a couple of weak moments . But don t worry , it s not like I call it every day . It s not like I m like , hello , they re like Jason . </s> <s> It wasn t like that , a couple of weak moments . That s not funny . But what s hilarious to me is that the people at the suicide hotline not trained at all , hilarious . One time I called this dude was like , is there an object around your room that could be a weapon that you could use it to hurt yourself with ? I was like , I have never thought about that before . So when he asked that shit , I started to look around the room , trying to get creative . I was like , sir , I think anything could be a weapon . If I run fast enough , the wall could be a weapon to you . Like , why would you direct my attention to weapons ? Why don t you say some nice shit ? Like , hey , man , do you got enough ice cream and the refrigerator ? Yeah , eat that shit , feel nice . What kind of shit is this ? Hey , man , do you got enough ? Yeah , in the kitchen , I guess . I could start myself in a face if you want me to . It s so funny this one time I called . I was like , hey , man , I m thinking about killing myself . Sort of got this guy was like this .

Cole , the Emperor of Hollywood s gonna be here tonight . You re not gonna impress him ? I will do what I can to impress the Emperor . Okay , well what bits are you gonna do ? I m gonna tell a story . What story ? Ladies and gentlemen , Steve Haustler . Thank you . I wanted to tell you the story of how I became an optimist . Now , it started when someone was murdered at my hotel . Don t worry , I ll make it funny . I was doing a gig in Syracuse last summer and I m coming back from the late show on a Saturday night . It s about 1 . 30 in the morning . Now as I pull up to the hotel , I see that there are 52 police cars surrounding the building . There was not a moment in my head where I was like , I bet this works out great and end . Maybe the police are just having a party . Ain t no party like the police party because the police party don t stop . Because you can t call the police . So , all right , everybody s gonna get it , got it . So I m stuck outside the hotel . They weren t letting us in . That s how I had time to count all the police cars . And one of the reporters told me that someone had been shot and killed in the room below mine . And they were still looking for the guy . Not the one who had been shot and killed . They knew exactly where he was , but the other one had escaped . The murderer got away . The murderie was right where they left him . So , the cops come out and one of them says , you go back in now if you want to . And I said , oh no , thank you . And he asked me why not , which I thought was a pretty odd question . I think it s obvious why I don t want to go into that hotel . I don t want to open up my door , see some guy in my bed being like , I don t want that . </s> <s> So he said , well , you don t have to go in if you don t want to . I said , fine , I ll go in if you come with me . He said , what ? I said , yeah , we ll go in together . You a little bit first . You have a look , see ? I ll grab my stuff . I ll get the fuck out of this hotel . And he said , yes . So I grabbed my stuff . And I got the fuck out of that hotel . Because I m a man of my word . And I drove as fast as I could , as far as I could . And I only got about 10 miles away before I got stopped by another cop for a suspicion of driving drunk . I don t know if you know this , but driving drunk and fleeing from a murder look a little bit the same . I don t know if you know that . Now the guy was a dick immediately , because he had thought he had gotten a collar . He thought I was wasted . He figured he would come up to the car and I would just be like , spring break . Like that s what he expected . So he pulled me over and he was a dick immediately . First thing he said , he goes , and how was your night going ? And he was not prepared for my response . I said , actually , officer , it s been a bad one . As it turns out , someone was murdered at my hotel . He was like , whoa , he didn t know how to deviate from the script . It was adorable . To watch him try to stick to that script . He s like , well , huh . Well , the reason I . . . Huh , huh . The reason I pulled you over , you were speeding ? Driving agratically . I said , well , I can explain that . As I mentioned earlier , someone was murdered at my hotel . Someone feeling aradic . Hey , officer , I have some questions . How come you re not at the hotel ? What are you doing out here ? Why the only cop in upstate New York is not at this hotel right now ? Can you invite to the police party ? Maybe check your Facebook notifications . Maybe it s under there . Also , how come you didn t ask me if I m the murderer ? I m driving quickly away from a murder . You re horrible at this . He didn t know how to handle all my sass . He just kept sticking to that script . He s like , so , where are you going to in such a hurry ? Away from murder . What direction you headed ? What direction ? The one we re facing . I m going west . It s the inner state . I m not banging a ui . I m going west . And so are you . Why are you going west ? Because we re not upstate New York . That s where the world lives . </s> <s> I m not going to Vermont . It s two in the morning . Vermont s closed . I m going to Buffalo . Why are you going to Buffalo ? I don t know . Because I could probably find a place to sleep in Buffalo . It s two in the morning . You don t know where you re sleeping at night ? No . Don t know if you were called from earlier . But someone was murdered at my hotel . So I m going to go now . And he said , OK , and he let me go . Because he didn t know how to write that up . I have not done it yet , but I would really like to review the hotel on Yelp . Well , I wanted to be perfect . So here s what I have in my save drafts . Excellent continental breakfast , too much murder , ample parking . Three stars . I m not going to even one star . I m going to be a dick to give something one star . It was just one murder . Two murders give a place one star , but one murder . What about the breakfast ? I don t understand people that give one star . One star means nothing worse could have happened . That s what it means . One star . Fuck you , what happened ? My fries were cold . Oh , no . Your fries were cold . That s the worst possible thing that could happen . What if your fries were cold and I put my dick in your fries ? What then ? Leave yourself room for fewer stars . It s not a tie . Sometimes people will do that on YouTube . I don t mean they ll put their dicks in somebody s fries . Although probably , they re an awful lot of channels , but I don t subscribe . My point is sometimes he will review something negatively to make themselves feel better . Why didn t you like this video ? Okay . Here s what I do when I m like a video . I m a weirdo . Here s what I do . I watch a different one . What the fuck is wrong with you ? You got to write that out . Just click thumbs down and move on with your life . If you have to warn the rest of us , just click thumbs down , move on . Why didn t you like this video ? The only reason you have to write that out is because you want that tie to your username . So you can show your asshole friends that you should on a stranger . Feel better about your small life . Why do you have to be so . . . I don t like this video . You ever do anything like that ? Fuck you . You re a bad person . Don t act like that . I didn t like this free piece of art . I had no obligation to watch . You ll watch something else . </s> <s> You re a bad decision maker . That shit s on you . What s wrong with you ? You got to tell everybody everything . You just walk by a restaurant , poke your head in . I m not eating here . Well , you re a vegan and this is a KFC . So . . . Move along . Someone tweeted they don t like one of my videos . I looked at their Twitter to see who they were . They had one follower . I was like , hey man . You didn t need to tweet that . You could have just told someone . Why would you waste your time tweeting anything with one follower ? Why do you have a Twitter account with one follower ? How about you tell two people expand your base ? Get the word out . Tell your parents . That s two people . Just call your parents . Just call them . You live with them . Just yell up the stairs . Just yell up the stairs . One follower . That means even the spam robots were like , no thank you . You know how sad that is ? But I enjoy Twitter a great deal . I love Twitter . You can learn from Twitter . When something s trending and I don t know why , I will click on it to learn what the rest of the world is talking about . I saw that Leviticus was trending . And I was like , why would Leviticus be trending ? Then I thought , oh , maybe Jay Z has a new baby . So I click on it . There s something else entirely . The reason Leviticus was trending was because there was a religious group using a quote from Leviticus to pursue gay people . There s a quote that says , thou shalt not lie with a man the way one would lie with a woman . They were using that to say that being gay was an abomination . And I thought , no , you read that wrong . That s not a prohibition . That s basic sex advice . Think it through . Thou shalt not lie with a man the way one would lie with a woman . And they got different parts flip him over . It s simple . That s what that means . Before Leviticus , two dudes were just banging dicks . And then God was like , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Thou shalt not lie with a man the way one would lie with a woman . And they were like , good looking out God . And then Leviticus was the first issue of Cosmo . Now , most of you enjoyed that . A few of you didn t because you re prejudice . But my point is that you can learn from Twitter . My favorite thing on Twitter right now are the redneck boycotts . Rednecks have been all over Twitter in the last year . I think it s because they just got the internet . They re like , real excited about it , you know ? And anytime anything progressive happens , there will be a fake redneck boycott . </s> <s> Now , what I mean by this is , so Trump banned immigrants . And then Starbucks came out and they said , hey , we re going to hire 10 , 000 refugees . All these xenophobic rednecks went on Twitter . We re not going to drink Starbucks anymore . And I was like , when the fuck did you drink Starbucks ? And if you did , didn t you stop when they had a red cup ? What are you talking about ? And then one of the actors in Hamilton had some words for Mike Pence during her performance . All these blindly patriotic rednecks went on Twitter . And they were like , we re not going to go see Hamilton anymore . And I was like , how the fuck did you get Hamilton tickets ? What are you talking about ? You can t boycott something you don t use . We re not going to drink Starbucks . We re not going to go see Hamilton . We re going to boycott next , Portland , Oregon . Shut up . You don t use these things . The one boycott that could have worked was the Budweiser boycott . During the Super Bowl , Budweiser had an ad . And the point of the ad was Budweiser saying , hey , you know our company was found about immigrants , like most things in this country . So maybe take a step back for a second , consider the ramifications of your actions . All these rednecks went on Twitter . They re like , we re not going to drink Budweiser anymore . And I was like , yes you are . What are you talking about ? No one chooses to drink Budweiser . That s not a choice . You re born that way . Look , we live in a very tolerant town . We re in a very tolerant time right now . We accept you for who you are . Whatever an adult does in the privacy of their own inner tube is up to them . I think that s in Leviticus somewhere . I know , Jay Z s baby . But Budweiser was spelled wrong in the hashtag . That s true . That s real . The word Budweiser is spelled B U D W E I S E R , like the word wiser , particularly ironic . Like how ? Do you misspell your own political movement ? How s that even possible ? You guys remember that famous speech in Martin Luther King , right ? I have a dram . You guys remember that , right ? I m scrolling through these tweets . And I m like , how dumb are these people ? And I saw one . I was like , oh , that dumb . Because there was a tweet that said , we need to support a real American beer . Like Heineken . Oh , no . </s> <s> Why does your vote count the same as mine ? That doesn t sound fair . I feel like maybe Rednecks votes should count like a little bit less . Not a lot less , just maybe like three fifths , you know ? But the problem with Twitter , the problem with Facebook , the problem with any social media is us , because we argue when someone s crazy , and we shouldn t . Stop paying attention to crazy . Let crazy shout into silence , and crazy will go away . In the real world , we do that . In the real world , we ignore it . If someone were out there on a street corner right now yelling out , I m the Roman Emperor ! You would just cross the street . But on Facebook , you re like , here are all the reasons why you re not the Roman Emperor . Like , why would you talk to that person ? There should be a cross the street button on Facebook . When that person is in the room , you re like , why would you talk to that person ? There should be a cross the street button on Facebook . When that be sweet , someone posts someone stupid , be like 31 people cross the street at this post . All right , dial back the crazy . Try not to argue with people . Sometimes you can t help it though . Sometimes a situation comes to you . The first time I was ever pulled over by a cop , I got a ticket for unsafe lane change . Now I didn t know that was a thing . If you re unfamiliar , here s what it means . You re driving the speed limit , then you put your turn signal on , then you carefully change lanes , and there s a cop in that lane trying to speed by you , he gives you a ticket . That s what it means . Well , I prevented an officer to law from breaking the law , and that is against the law . So , it was how he gave me the ticket though that stayed with me , because the first thing he said , he didn t say , you know , if Fess , you were going , you were driving recklessly , he didn t even say , no , was you re not going . He didn t say any of that . He just looks at me and he goes , well thanks for making my stuff fly everywhere . Thanks for making my stuff . I m sorry , officer , unorganized , but what stuff do you have to fly ever where you playing Jenga in your passenger seat ? What happened before I got here ? How do you drive ? Did all the books come off your bookshelf ? How do you drive ? Maybe he keeps a handgun on the dashboard . He just keeps a handgun on the dash . He slams the brakes , handgun flies to the windshield , accidentally shoots a black man . He s like , no , no , believe this . Like , is that how it went down ? I know . I was offended too . And . . . I gave him my license . </s> <s> I figured it was all I could do , because there wasn t a moment in my head where I was like , this is going to work out great , man . So I gave him my license . I figured he would look me up . He would find out , well he would try to look me up . His computer could be anywhere , but he would do his best to find it . Sift through the rubble , rebuild . Then he would look me up . He d find out I have a good record . He d come back with a warning . I d be the end of it . But that wasn t the end of it . Because he came back with a ticket in under two minutes . Under two minutes . You ever been pulled by a cop ? Take some longer than 15 minutes just to walk to the car , doesn t it ? Because they re messing with your head . They re trying to ice the kicker . That s what they re doing . They re trying to make sure you re so frazzled by the time they finally get to the car . You re like , ah , I ll go into the glove box . That s what they want . I was mad . I was like , why are you giving me this ticket ? He said , well , if I were to hit you , it would have been your fault . I said , no . You hit me . That sounds a lot like your fault . He said , yeah , but you took the lane . So it s your fault . I said , okay , pretend time . If we re going to do this , at least let s do this correctly . Whether or not I took the lane as a material , because we re in California right now , which is a one party state . But that means that the person at the back of any accident is responsible for the entire accident . He said , I don t know how it works . I said , well , I am not a police officer . But aren t you a police officer ? So , hey , do you think we should ask you ? So I just kept asking the questions . That s what I did . I asked him question after question after question after question . Because he was mad that I slowed him down . Fuck that guy . I asked him 27 minutes worth of questions . That s right . Yeah . I detained a police officer . That s what I did . This happened in Laverne , California . The guy s name was Officer Alvarez . I do not have a joke about his name . I just think that you should know it because he s a prick . So Officer Alvarez from Laverne Police Department . I m going to say the third time . Officer Alvarez from Laverne Police Department . I ll let joke every day this year . That s right . Yeah . Yeah . This happened last March . Fuck that guy . Here s why I do this . Because one of you will help me get my revenge . </s> <s> I don t know who it ll be . Could be someone watching this tonight . You ll be driving through Laverne . It ll be months from now . You ll have forgotten about this show . You won t even know that you re in Laverne . Because no one goes there on purpose . You pass through on your way to somewhere decent . And then you ll get pulled over . Because you ll have just done something legal . So you will get pulled over . And tonight we ll come flooding back to you . And you will see that it says Alvarez . And you ll say , I ve heard a great deal about you . And I will have won . Because I don t like when people in positions of power get into those positions just to abuse the power of that position . But thanks to people . But cops are not the worst at this . They re not . Flight attendants . They re the fucking worst . Because they lied to us . The first thing they say , your safety is our number one concern . No , it s not . No , it s not . Our money is your number one concern . If you cared anything for my safety , why is it in front of me made a hard plastic ? Seven inches from my nose . Why is that , huh ? You think that s safe ? Pumps the brakes . Like , dude , like you think that s safe ? Pumps the brake ? What the fuck am I talking about ? Pumps the brake . Is that how it works up there ? Another plane just tailgating behind . Go around . I m picking someone up . Go around . You can see my fleshy . I don t even know if there are brakes on a . . . Ooh , brakes on a plane , scary movie . Anyway , so . . . Get these motherfucking brakes off my motherfucking plane . So I try to avoid talking to the flight attendants when I fly . I try to avoid talking to anyone when I fly . Because we are the worst version of ourselves . The second we get to an airport , I don t know what Lord of the Flies shit happens . But we re just like , fuck society . This is my day . Like , I was flying in Japan . And I was happy in an airport for the first time . I m never happy in an airport . Because we really are the worst versions of ourselves . There s always someone on the flight with a shrieking baby who doesn t care that they ve brought the most hackneyed cliché thing you could possibly wear on a plane . Like , oh , they re so temperamental when they re this age . I m like , yeah , I m still temperamental . </s> <s> I m going to kill that baby . Oh , he s got to learn to crime himself about . . . Oh , he s not today . He s got to learn to shut the fuck up today . This is a teachable moment . Now , I am not saying if you have a kid , you cannot fly with your kid . Obviously , if you have a kid and you have to fly , you have to fly with your kid . What I am saying is make an effort . That is what I ask of you . Just make an effort . There are so many laws in the sky how come try isn t one of them . Fail all you want , but I want to see you try . I don t want the flight attendant to help . I want them to just walk right up . He s like , hey , can you just set that baby to airplane mode ? You know , I d be happy to check it to your final destination if that ll help . That ll never happen . That s my sick dream , but it ll never happen . I just want to show up at baggage claim once . Just one day , see a bunch of . . . Just a conveyor belt with a bunch of babies going around , going around , going around . Some confused dad being like , don t just take one lot of them look the same . It s a terrifying announcement . Don t just take a bag a lot of them look the same . I have flown thousands of times . I ve never taken someone else s bag . Here s my trick . Here s my trick . I m not fucking dumb . Yeah . That s the trick . Yeah , I get off the plane that I m not a dumb guy , that I get my bag , that I m still not a dumb guy . It s a four step process . And if you have taken someone else s bag and you feel bad about yourself right now , good , let the pain be a lesson . Because I want better for you . How do you screw that up ? Your name s on your bag . I don t even mean the bag tag that you should be smart enough as an adult to put on your bag . I mean the one that every airline anywhere affixes to your bag . That white sticker with your name , your origin , your destination . Why does your bag know more about you than you know about your bag ? How did that happen ? To step off the plane . I thought I was scut , but I guess I m Brian today . I hope Brian has better stuff than scut , dude . Well , scut stuff is used . Also , your bag looks like your bag . I think that should be the biggest clue that your bag is your bag . It s the one you were touching four fucking hours ago . How long is your flight that you plummed for got what your bag looked like ? You re not going around the world in the eight day as Jules Verne . You re going to Dallas . Pick up your fucking bag . </s> <s> There s no one in cargo furiously painting all the bags . Like , no , it looks like how bad are you at life ? You getting to anyone s car ? Are you my wife ? I don t know things . I don t know things . Time to start a new life with my new stuff . I hope it s better than my old stuff . Don t hit the brake . My stuff will fly everywhere . And then there s always someone taking up half of my seat . Why is that okay ? We shouldn t have to be okay with that . I bought a seat . I d like that whole seat . There s never been a box to check off that says donate half my seat to charity . I bought a seat . I want a seat . But I don t want to have to pay for two seats . Okay . I didn t want to have to pay for one seat . But I did not fit in no seats . So what am I to do ? I had to upgrade to the one . Because they don t sell these in half seat increments . Maybe they should . We could start like an app . We could start an app . We re like two people go by three seats on one flight . Yeah , be called can t fit in the kayak . com . Most of you are with me . Some of you didn t laugh . Some of you were distracted trying to figure out whether or not you can make the app . But others looked at me stone faced . Judging me . How dare you , sir ? You re skinny . You can t make jokes about that . How dare you ? How dare you ? You don t know me . You ve known me for a half hour . You think you know what I ve always looked like ? Because I look like this right now . I used to weigh over 300 pounds . Yeah . I topped out at 308 and high school was very difficult for me . And one day I decided to do something about it . And I started running and that became my thing . And every day I ran every day for 15 fucking years so that I could look like this . None of that s true . That s what I do . But if you change your mind about me or hypocrite , you should know that about yourself . You shouldn t ever let someone excuse a joke just because they re part of who they re making fun of . Some comedians will try to do that . A bad joke is a bad joke no matter who tells it . An offensive joke is an offensive joke no matter who tells it . I was working with a Chinese comic once and he came off stage and he asked me . He was like , what do you think of my set ? I said , I think he came off as kind of racist . </s> <s> He said , I can t be racist , dumb Chinese . I said , first of all , that s kind of racist . Second of all , more importantly , you did a joke about how all Asian people can t drive . That s a racist joke . He said , well , I could say that I m Chinese . So what ? You re not all Asian people . You re one Chinese guy . You re only one more Chinese guy than I am . I am two Chinese guys away from being more Chinese guys than you are . And statistically speaking , two is not a large number of Chinese guys . And that is a joke about the global population . My point is that we pay for what we use . We re adults . That is the social contract . You use two seats , you pay for two seats . I am six foot four . I pay extra for the exit row because I need that leg room . If I were eight foot four , do you think I would not buy the seat in front of me ? Do you think I would just let my leg dangle over your seat ? Just kick you in the face at the back of my shoe . Don t oppress me . I m big boned . And that d be true because tall people have big bones . That s how bones work . What s this big bones guard ? You re not big boned . You re big near the bones . The bones are the same size . No one s going to the gym to work off their bones . Okay ? Oh , it s Glutes Lats in Bone Day at the gym . Bone Day is the hardest day at the gym . Don t skip bone day . So my point is , I was going to Japan . And I was happy in the airport for the first time . But my happiness got derailed . Because as I m walking through LAS , I see a woman with a dog just shitting in the airport . The dog was shitting . We re on the same page . I don t know how your imaginations work . But I don t want anyone to just picture a woman holding a dog . The woman was on the phone . That was the problem . She was on FaceTime ignoring the dog . You can t control what your dog does , but you also can t ignore your dog in a public place . So this woman is ignoring the dog , she s on the phone , and someone sees this and says , Hey , miss , your dog . The woman looks away from her phone . Looks at the guy . Looks back at her phone and says , some people are so rude . I know we re like , oh , this woman dies today . </s> <s> You know , this is exciting . But she starts to walk away . Yeah , she just leaves . Someone else tries to intercept her and says , miss , you can t just leave that there . You have to clean up after yourself . And she says , oh , they have people for that . You ever say that about cleaning up after yourself ? They have people for that ? Well , we should all fuck you up , because they got doctors . So . . . I am now left guarding the shit . That s my new job . I m guarding the shit . It wasn t in the itinerary that dealt to sent me . But that s my new job . So I m guarding the shit , because if I walk away , I m part of the story . I saw it happen . I can t just leave that there . Because if I walk away , someone s going to wheel their bag right into it . Because you don t expect to see that . You don t walk through an airport being like , hope there s no dog shit on the ground . And I m like , no , you walk through an airport . Just go and send them on . Like , that s all you do . So I m guarding the shit . Maintenance comes over , they clean it up . And I thought , okay , now I can go to my gate . Now I can go to Japan . Now I can be happy . Almost optimistic . But I couldn t be happy yet . Because this woman was at my gate . She was also going to Tokyo . And she has now done something even worse than what she had already done . What could possibly be worse than leaving your dog shit on the floor without cleaning it up ? Something some of you have done before . She was listening to music in a public space , no headphones on . Don t ever do that . Don t ever fucking do that . We don t need to be our airport DJ . They re playing smooth jazz . They got us covered , okay ? How inconsiderate of a human being do she have to be ? I just pictured her car park diagonally across three spaces with paint on the bumper from the tricycle she hit , you know , just a total dick . And most people are avoiding her . Because she s loud and obnoxious . But I decide to sit down next to Kurella and have a little bit of fun . I say , are you going to London on business ? To which she says , I m going to Tokyo . To which I say , oh no , that place moved to get 53 C . This is the flight to London . Now that s fun for a lot of reasons . The main one is I want to give her that little bit of panic . You know that self doubt I m talking about that moment in your life ? Like every time I ve ever checked in a hotel , it takes some one extra second to find Hofstetter . I m like , is this hotel even real ? You know what that panic ? That s all I wanted for her . </s> <s> I figured it would last . Maybe a couple of seconds . She would get up , she would check the monitor , see it still said Japan . She would look at the gate agent . The gate agent would say , yes , this is the flight to Japan . She would look around the gate and see that everyone except for me was Japanese . Like why ? Did she not notice that ? Why am I there ? What does she think I m there teaching ? What am I doing there ? This red hooks taking all these Japanese people to London . This is a weird day . He s only one Japanese person away from being Japanese . But she doesn t do any of that . She just gets up and leaves . Just walks away . Doesn t even thank me . Which I thought was rude . But just leaves . I know some people are so rude . She just leaves . So I got up and I boarded the plane . And then I don t know what the fuck happened . How could I know ? I was in Japan . I have no idea what happened to Los Angeles . I know that I was happy . I know a few more details of this story . I know that she was not on my plane . Now I know that because I was sitting toward the front . If she had walked by me , I d have noticed her . But more importantly , we were delayed by about 20 minutes . Now if you don t fly much , you might think that s the plane waiting for her . That s adorable . Planes don t wait for people . This isn t a carpool . We re going to Japan and we are fucking leaving . However , if you check a bag and then you miss your flight , for safety reasons , they have to take the time to take the bag off . In that process , it takes about 20 minutes . So I m just laughing . I m losing my mind . Everyone else is upset . Everyone else is on the plane . Like , what are we on the turn back for so long ? I m like , you have no idea what I just did for you . You have no idea . I m not the hero you deserve , but I m the one you need . I know two more details . I know LAX very well . So well , that I know that there is no gate 53 s scene . That was an extra middle finger on the fuck you sandwich . For free . I also know that Delta only has one flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo per day . The one that I was on . Now it is possible that they rebooked Toronto another airline . That is possible . I hope it was united and they beat the fuck out of her . </s> <s> I hope so . Because they have people for that . I have this thing that makes it difficult for me to fly . I have this condition where I don t like people . Some of you know what I m talking about . Some of you , you meet more people . You get it . You ever meet so many shitheads in a row you get introduced to someone new you re like , this will probably suck . So I just hang out with my dog . That s what I do . I just hang out with my dog . He s the best . He s a Staffordier bull terrier named Walter Mathau . He s awesome . If you aren t familiar with Staffordies of breed , it s like a pit bull face on a pig s body . Yeah , he s a potato with feet . He s the best . And sometimes people are afraid of pit bulls because they re illiterate . Well , if you know anything about dogs , you know you re more likely to get bit by a small dog than a big dog . Anybody who has a small dog knows that . Anybody who has a small friend also knows that . But people will make that in an argument . Well , if it did bite you , wouldn t it hurt more because it s bigger ? Yeah , probably . But we don t ban big people . They got hurt us more . I look this up . The Netherlands tallest country . People on average in the Netherlands are a foot taller than some other countries . And no one has ever said , don t go to the Netherlands . What if one snapped ? They re nice people . Now , I can t always bring Walter on the road with me . I tried to , but there are some places that have breed specific legislation . Now , if you re unfamiliar with BSL , here s what it means . It means county will get together and based on minutes of research . That s comedic exaggeration . They don t do any research . Based on feeling in the face of statistics , they will ban a breed of dog , decide it s too dangerous , they ll ban a breed of dog to protect people . And then if you go through that place with that breed , they can impound him and put him down that day with no due process . Which is strange to me , because those same places don t seem to care about gun control . That s confusing . I guess it makes a little bit of sense . I mean , maybe one day someone will get real drunk and accidentally fire off their pit bull . Now , for the gun owners in the crowd , and this is Indiana , so . . . away we go . For the gun owners in the crowd , I have a point to make . No one s coming for your guns . You sound dumb when you speak like that . They re taking our guns ! No ! No one s taking it . We want you to register your guns , like you register anything potentially dangerous . </s> <s> You register your car with no issue . When you re at the DMV , you re like , they re taking our cars ! What did you just say ? Yeah , first of all , we get driver s license and the next thing you know , we re walking everywhere ! It s a slippery slope ! No , sometimes it s flat land . And . . . I m sure that there are gun owners in this crowd right now who are getting uncomfortable . You re getting upset about this material , but every single gun owner here knows someone who owns a gun that you wish didn t . Every last one of you has been in the firing range . Have been like , grads here ? We re all gonna fucking die . Every single one of you ! That s who I don t want to have a gun . Now , you might say , well , it doesn t matter what you want , because of the amendment . Second amendment protects them as a right and not a privilege , and I ll give you that . I ll give you the second amendment . Defend the second amendment with all of your heart . If you also defend every other amendment , or know what they say . Amendment people are hilarious . Freedom of speech , right to bear arms ? I m tired . Like what ? About the rest ! There are so many ! Like the 7th amendment ! No one ever cares about the 7th amendment . Why doesn t anyone ever defend the 7th amendment ? None of you even know what it says . Some of you are trying to think of it right now . Like , is it plead the 5th ? No , that s the 5th amendment . The 7th ! The 7th amendment says that every civil matter involving more than 20 can go to full jury trial . Or maybe it doesn t . You don t fucking know . Either amendments are sacred or they re not . It s as simple as that . And if you re someone who feels you need to own a gun because you want to protect yourself from your neighbor . Okay , I support that . I do . I think that the 2nd amendment is important . I think that a person who is educated and responsible and regulated should be allowed to own a gun . However , if you need a gun because you re afraid of the government , you don t know how tanks work . What is your plan ? When the tanks come rolling down the street , they re like , we ve prepared for this . Dink ? I do not think we ve prepared for this . They have invisible planes . They re just going to shoot the sky until you hit Wonder Woman . What is your plan ? My point is I love my dog . And they are coming for our dogs . I was never a dog person . I was never a dog person until I went on a date with a really hot girl and she was like , I love dogs . </s> <s> And I was like , you re hot , me too . And that s Darwinism . So now I have a dog . And I love him very much . And I ve become an advocate in the rescue community . And I m learning a great deal about dogs . My friends are trying to educate me , make me a better part of that community . One of my friends sent me a story that said there was a dog act in weird . And they figured out that their house is on fire just because the dog was acting weird . And it sends me another story that says there was a dog act in weird . And they figured out that their kid had autism because the dog was acting weird . He sends me these stories . He s like , aren t these stories incredible ? I said , no . These are the worst stories I ve ever heard . Sometimes my dog acts weird . Now I need to figure out what the fuck is wrong . You know , terrifying that knowledge is every time my dog goes in a circle one too many times after , do I have epilepsy ? Or , do I leave the stove on or my dog ate a grape ? What happened ? By the way , if you ever figure out that your child has autism because your dog acts weird , please pay more attention to your family . I think that s . . . Solid advice said in using your dog as the check engine light of your household . I had one dog that was a weirdo . He was part Dalmatian and part Chihuahua . I know , that means something terrible happened . That s not romantic . What do you think that was Romeo and Juliet ? Our love is forbidden because it s physically impossible . No , a Dalmatian took down a Chihuahua . You get that , right ? Or . . . The most badass Chihuahua of all time . Climb the board , pick the spot and went to town . My point is . . . He shouldn t even exist but I love my little rape baby . I love him so much . It s not his fault . His dad wasn t asshole but it s not his fault . Now , because I love dogs , because I have one , my cousin is convinced that that means I m going to have kids , like it s a gateway drug . I think it s because parents will do anything to convince the rest of us to become you . When you have a kid , become one of us . When you have a kid , become one of us . We don t do that to you . You are the shittiest cult . At least your hovers witness is not going to door before they start with their shit . When you have a kid , become one of us . When you have a kid , become one of us . We don t do that to you . We re not like , when are you going to murder your kids ? Become one of us . But you don t know true joy until you have children . </s> <s> You think you do but you don t . You don t know true joy . You think you do . You don t . You don t know true joy . You don t know . I sleep till noon . I have not true joy . You re sleep deprived . That s delirium . That s delirium . But who s going to take care of you when you get older if you don t have any children ? It costs a quarter of a million dollars to raise a child . So instead of having two kids , I m going to have half a million dollars . And then I m going to use that money to hire your kids to take care of me . They won t have any time left to take care of you because you didn t plan . My cousin will call me up , brag about his son without ever considering my feelings . Say things like , oh today James said the funniest thing . Really ? The funniest thing . I m a professional comedian . What the fuck did James say ? Oh , he pronounced a word wrong . He s not funny . He s behind in school . You should help James . Instead of mocking your child , he said nothing funny . I said something funny about James . Fuck James . He s eight . Please don t fuck James . Don t fuck James . My cousin is such a nag . He says things like , oh you have a dog . You re just practicing for children . And I say , you re a bad parent . If you don t have the difference between dogs and kids , that s day one . For the parents and the crowd , I don t mean to get cocky . I know I ve never had children , but I feel like I would know the difference . I know you don t truly know until you go through the experience yourself , but I feel like they would hand me my baby and I would be like , not a dog . But Kunamatata , it would be beautiful . It s obvious to anyone who has ever met at least one of each of those things that dogs and kids are very different . It s clear , dogs and kids are incredibly different . Dogs are way smarter than kids . It s obvious . Oh , I have proof . I have proof . I own a home and all my electrical outlets are uncovered . They re just open to the public . My dog is never going to be like , he s never done that because he s good at being alive . But a child , your child , will put their finger in an outlet , get shocked and be like , let me go find a fork . It s insane . And how bad kids are at basic survival . You don t believe me ? Put a plastic bag next to one for 15 seconds . I never said walk away . Stick close , you ll be needed in a moment . No child has ever had the smart thought . </s> <s> No kid anywhere has ever looked at that bag and said , I could put my things in that bag . Carry them from room to room . Make my life a little more convenient . No . Every kid no matter where they re from in the world is that same dome . Space helmet , like every single kid . Even if their country has no space program . I don t know how they know . But they know . If you re a parent , you know I m right . You don t want me to be , but you know I am . You just follow your child around . It s going , don t die . Don t die . Don t die . Don t die . Don t die . Because you could fucking up emotionally , but you can t let it die . That s the rule , right ? You can t . Because if you kill someone , you re a monster . But if you raise a murderer , you dead your best . Like why ? Aren t you part of that ? You taught a murderer how to walk . That s the first part of murder . Kids will do anything potentially fatal . Anything . If there was an F2 school program where children could sign up for fatal activities , it would be faux immediately . And then empty , like a week later . Because they re efficient . And if you still don t believe me , the dogs are smarter than kids . Answer this . Why has there never been a seeing eye kid ? That s a fair question . There s a lot of blind people . There s a ton of kids . And no one has ever thought , maybe these two together . No one has ever made that mistake . Because if you had a seeing eye kid , you know what else you would have ? Dead blind man . That s what you d have . Yeah . Then a child playing in the middle of traffic next to a corpse as cars whizz by its dumb face . Because it doesn t know it s in danger . And at some point kids do become smarter than dogs . I know what age it is . I think it s like 27 28 . I don t know when it happens . Now there are probably some 25 roads in this crowd who are offended by that joke . But there are definitely some 25 roads in this crowd who did not get that joke . And my point is , if you have a young child at home , you have to get a babysitter just to join us tonight . That s right . You have to hire another child to watch your child . In some kind of Russian nesting doll of irresponsibility . Why would you ever trust a 15 year old with a baby ? </s> <s> I wouldn t trust a 15 year old with a shared cell phone plan . Why would you give it a baby ? Because you have no choice . If you don t hire a babysitter , you re stuck at home for 10 years . A decade of house arrest . You have to spend more on your babysitter than you do on going out . Meanwhile , my dog is home alone right now . I don t give a shit . You know what , right ? That is . I m here . My dog is like , I got this . I m four . I m 40 figure this whole thing out . I ll never lie to you in my standard . My dog is not four . He s 13 . Which means he s only known how to take care of himself for 13 years . But my point is , I don t like talking to people on planes . I try to sleep through every flight . That is my goal . I bring a real pillow with me , like a bedroom pillow . I was flying back home to L . A . to do a show . I put the pillow next to me . I put my head down . The flight attendant comes racing over . She says , you can t have a pillow in the exit row . I said , but I do . It appears a word in an impasse . She said , well , what happens if we crash ? I said , it ll help . I don t know if you ve heard much about pillows , but they re fantastic . They re soft . They float . Those are two characteristics I would want to bring something to a plane crash . I d want them to have those characters . If I could bring anything in the world to a plane crash , I would bring a pillow and a second plane . Those would be the two things I would need . She said , no , what if we crash and the pillow falls and someone has to get by it ? What will you do ? I said , oh , well , in that case , I ll let them step on my pillow because I m not a monster . You d have to be . For someone to be on fire , screaming . And I would just say , can you please watch the pillow ? Yeah , I get it . Burning alive . What ifs ? That cost me 8 . I don t even be there to say that . I m in the exit row . I m the first one to fuck off the plane . But she keeps at it . She says , no , what if the pillows slows them down ? What if a pillow slows someone down during a plane crash ? It s their time . Yeah . I believe Darwin was a smart guy , big fan . I don t think we need that person . I think we get rid of the length strength in the chain . </s> <s> What is that person going to do for us ? They re just going to die tomorrow on some final destination shit . If you can t get by a pillow on a plane crash , you ll be like , I have to get out of here . I think Jerry , I think . We didn t lose a doctor when that happened , okay ? We lost off Seralvres from the Leverne Police Department . That s what we lost . But she keeps it up . She says , no , what if the pillow obscures their path ? What if the pillow obscures their path ? I think you mean obstructs their path . I understand the words of obscures and obstructs . They start the same , but they get real different . And I don t want you mixing up words because your job is to protect us in case of an emergency . You re in charge of our safety . As I recall , it is your number one concern . And I don t want you fucking up when there s a problem . I don t want to hear everybody head toward the explosion . I mean exit . I don t want that . But let s explore what you did me . What if a pillow obscures someone s view of their path or obstructs their path ? Now how hilariously tiny are the people in this airplane ? That a pillow is going to get anyone s way ever . I ve never seen a movie that gets to the end of a tunnel . Turn back , it s a pillow ! I ve never seen that . Dude on the other end of the mile for me was so big , he could cool aid man his way out of the plane , which was particularly funny because he was wearing all red , but nobody laughed . So she just kept at it . And she said , you re going to have to give me that pillow and I said , you re going to have to give me a good reason . And then she said , the strangest thing I ve heard of my whole life . She said , crazed things can happen during a plane crash . A paper cut could decapitate someone during a plane crash . What ? A paper cut could decapitate someone during a plane crash . Those words in that order on purpose . What else is ping ponging around in her head ? Like , I like peanut butter . They used swam like , what else is up there ? But that s what she landed on . A paper cut could decapitate somebody in a plane crash and I said , that s not a thing . Because I was out of clever . I had no response . I m a pretty quick guy that chamber was empty . Well , conversations at two way street , I say something that leads you to say some peripherally related to what I just said . </s> <s> That s not what happened that day . Because all I said was , you re going to have to give me a good reason . I didn t say , hey , something little fuck me out for 10 years . I didn t say that . But that s what she heard . And she said a paper cut could decapitate somebody in a plane crash . And I wish I had thought about it . I would have said something smarter . I wish I had time to think about it . I said , no ! No ! I will not accept the premise of the paper cut to decapitate somebody in a plane crash . I ll suck , accept the premise of the paper at the exact right velocity . At the exact right angle , because sever vein you could bleed out . But paper s not going through bone . Paper is not going through bone . If it could , paper acts as if it would finally fucking make sense . But it does it . And it never will . And why are we even talking about paper ? We re talking about pillows a second . There s paper everywhere in this airplane . This is a dog who are front of me . There s a skyman front of me . There is a dude in seven b . You re going to say today it s going to decapitate everybody last one of us . Your safety instructions are written on a piece of paper . And those are your number one concern . But I did not have all that . So I just said , that s no the thing . But the crazy train had a second stop to make . She said , well you don t know , you ve never been in a plane crash . And I said , well you re talking to me , so you haven t either . I m assuming . I m assuming she s not the sole survivor for crash we never heard of . Just a great paper got crashed in 2004 . And we never heard of it because it wasn t in the news . Oh they tried to interview her . They did . They went right to her house . They said , we have a few questions for you . She said , who are you ? They said , we re with the paper . She said , I m afraid of paper . They never got the story . And now she goes to work every day , surround with a mountain of skymalls and sadoku s . And she perseveres even though she has PTSD , which is very serious . Paper traumatic stress disorder . It s incredibly serious . It makes opening letters very difficult for her , but she perseveres because she s an American hero . Or she is a nutball on a powered trip . Likely that one . So I gave her the pillow . I just wanted to be over . There s no arguing with unearned authority . So I gave her the pillow and it was over . I put my sleep mask on and it was over for about three seconds . Because I put my sleep mask on and she shook me , which is assault . </s> <s> But she shook me . And she said , you re going to have to give me that sleep mask and I lost my shit . Are you kidding me ? I was like , are people going to have a problem getting by this also ? Is cod on a rubber band going to kill everybody in the airplanes ? But what happens if we crash , you have to take it off ? What do I do ? I said , I ll take it off . What is your problem ? It s not locked . It s not a magic trick . What are you talking about ? I ll just take it s cod on a rubber band going to kill everybody in the airplanes . So anything that slows you down could kill you . I said , why would you put us all in seat belt ? You re going to tie us down to your death trap . Is that your plan ? Is that what happens if we crash and you re asleep ? What will you do ? I said , I will wake the fuck up . That s what I ll do . I m not sleeping through a plane crash . What kind of a narcoleptic family do you have ? That you think I can sleep through a plane crash ? You re going to run me on fire screaming and I m like , five more minutes , mommy . Do you think that s a possibility ? And if we do crash and I am asleep , can you just not wake me ? Who wakes someone up to die ? Hey . Sleepyhead . You almost missed this . Yeah , you were going to die without knowing . We wanted to make sure that you died with fear in your heart . We understand that you have a choice when it comes to air travel . We d like to thank you for flying United . So I finally get home and I m driving to the gig . There s a guy in front of me about to make the last left turn before I get there and he s not turning left . You ever get caught behind somebody like that ? Who s like , how do I do this ? What s next ? Why am I in Brian s car ? Who are my parrots ? It just has no idea what they re doing . And I don t mean like he s looking down at his phone not paying attention like an adult . I mean staring straight ahead like a psychopath , just not moving . The reason that happens is because we give people driver s licenses when they re 16 and we don t road test them again for decades . That doesn t sound safe . Why are we okay with that ? Just give someone a driver s license ? Oh , thank you . No . Do you have to road test if you re good ? </s> <s> Now , you got this . What if the laws change ? Rendering everything I know useless ? You got this . What if technology changes ? Rendering everything everyone knows useless ? You got this . What if I renew my license by mail for 50 years ? Don t ever get behind the wheel of a car again . Is it still legal to drive ? Can t possibly be legal to drive , right ? No , you got this . I don t remember anything I learned when I was 16 . Do you ? If you had a new trigonometry to start your car , how many of us would take the bus ? And that s who I was behind . Because this guy s not taking a lift . There s a space he doesn t go . The light turns yellow , he doesn t go . The light turns red , he doesn t go . Finally , it does beat and then he goes . Now , I m stuck in the middle of an intersection on a red light in Los Angeles . I have a decision to make . Two choices . Either stay in the middle of the intersection or take a left on red . Which would you do ? Left on red . I agree with you . I agree with you . The cop who saw that she did not agree with you . And so . . . Would have been helpful to have you there , arguing my case . But she was right to pull me over . She only saw me break the law . She didn t see the guy in front of me . So she comes over the car . There was a moment in my head where I thought . . . . . . is probably gonna work out great , man . So she asked me for my license or registration . And I give them to her . And she looks down at them . She hands them right back to me . And motions for me to go forward . I said , officer , is everything alright ? She said , yeah . I saw your show . So where did you see my show ? She said Syracuse . I don t want to be named . You have a good day . I won the game . That s when I decided that I should be an optimist . Thank you so much , Indiana . Have a good night ! Now I think it ll work . I could do your set . I can t do my set . No one should do your set . </s>"

I m not going to let you go . I m not going to let you go . Pardon me , honey . Did you hear the question ? God damn , don t sit up there like you know , Oh , Roberts , first of all . Oh , Roberts . Oh , Roland , that s a hell of a name for a preacher . It sounds like you might eat the congregation . Let me tell you a good story about a preacher . He was an old couple past 70 . Both of them . You re sitting in the front room with their home rocking . Listening to the radio , they were comfortable because the home was almost paid for . They ve been living there 55 years . And one of those faith healers came on the radio . A couple were listening real tense . The faith healer said , I can heal you tonight . If you want to be healed , put one hand on your radio while . And put one hand on what you want to heal . So the old lady was listening closing . She reached on , put one hand on the radio . Put one hand on old tired heart . She started saying , wait in the water . Wait for the children . Her husband looked over as he said , is it what the hell I took a chance ? He put one hand on the radio and sneak one hand down his left . His wife looked over at him . She said , her , but the man said , could heal not raise the dead . Tonight I m going to talk about children . I don t have any children myself , but I did write a poem for children as Christmas . Christmas bells and Santa s elves and presents need the tree . The kids are all in slumberland . It s a quarter after three . In the morning , they ll be laughter . Children playing with their toys . Make you want to choke when their mother buckles . But make it so much noise . That s something else I want to clear up tonight . Motherfucker . See for years , motherfucker has been attributed to black people . You know , clear that shit up tonight . Motherfucker belongs to the world . Let s define it . Motherfucker . That means if you re a father , you re a motherfucker . That s right .

I m glad I don t have any children , oh . Out of a second , even when I was 13 . I knew then I didn t want to go crying and shitin around my house . Live , but that s what happens . Soon you get kids , grindin shitin . Go to hospital and pick them up . They re shitin your hand and they cry . Somebody shitin your hand , you should cry . That s where I think the Lord fucked the beginning . The ass don t belong in the pants . The ass belongs somewhere the ass can hit it . You cover your ass all up and everything . You put drawers on your ass and pants and drop it strapped on blooms all your shit on your ass . Ass can even breathe in . Smother your ass or death ? The ass should be in the palm of the hand . Right there , that s where nice place for that is . You walk right on in the toilet and get things taken care of . You know people are fuckin it . Somebody make you mad and the traffic accident ? Smack the shit out of them . Ooh , man , I m glad I ain t no kid . Cause I knew myself as a youngster and he was three of us triplets . Ed , red and Fred . That is true . Triplets born 15 minutes apart . My dad came to hospital . He saw his land and the crib . He looked at my mother . He said , Mary , you pick out the one you want cause I ma drown your mother too . Shit , I always been lucky . Hey , brothers , that a gold tooth in your mouth ? Don t smile with that gold tooth when you get back to the ghetto . On him , Nick is the bigger mind in your face . I use Nick all the time , don t make no difference . Nick doesn t mean nothing . Really , it s an addiction area . You should get used to it . It s an addiction area . Nick is our lazy and shifless . That s the definition . Nick is our lazy and shifler . That means we got some white , Nick is two . That s the education . Cause I didn t go to college . I knew I wasn t going to college when I didn t get in high school . I said , fuck , they weren t teaching nothing . They were teaching me filth in school . Well , well , well , my pussy fell in the well . I like to drown when I was 13 . Oh , that s all right , baby . </s> <s> And they had another one . Little boy , blue , come blow your horn .

You both look at me like the fart . Yeah , the fucking fart . Don t look at me . I had nothing to do with it . The Lord created the fight . Then put a smell in it so the deaf could enjoy it . I think the Lord fucked up on that odor . See , if I had created the fart , I d have made it smell like coffee . That way if someone farted in the morning , you d think breakfast was ready . The Lord knew we needed the fart . How else did you eat a big bowl of beans inside a cabbage sweet potato ? Siser or onion is a peach cobbling , two Pepsi colas , and not be able to fight . The hell in two days you d be a balloon . In a week you d be a fucking rocket . There s a guy with a nice smile on the hand . Sir , can I ask you a first question ? Did you ever go to the movies and let out one of them quiet fart ? And sit there and watch people move ? These things happen . Here s a nice look at gentlemen here . Class , bougie .

She was in the bathroom spraying pine salt all around the toilet . Plenty of pine salt , shh , everything was sparkling fresh . This gas started working down . I mean , she had to fight . But the guest went in the room , she said , shh , why don t they go out somewhere else ? </s> <s> Yeah , because you went out of the hallway to fight . And some people were coming to hall with the luggage , she said , shh , what am I going to do ? So she spied the elevator . She jumped on this elevator and shut the door . And she cut loose . Bam ! And she took a pine salt and sprayed it all around the elevator . Shh , shh , plenty of pine salt . And the door is an elevator open and a drunk that own . She said , what s the matter with you ?

This meat wouldn t hear you be wearing goggles . What do you cut this meat off completely and still here ? Because the hole is more important than the meat . Would you agree with that ? But if our ears had been somewhere else , like back here . Can you imagine when an entertainer is going to be in the house ? I m not sure . I m not sure . Can you imagine when an entertainer had to look at in case the crowd was really listening ? One thing , if ears were back here , wouldn t be too much whispering going on . I know I wouldn t have them that said it no fellers . I might whisper to a girl one night though . Is it , hey honey , you know what ? Your ears smell like shit . I hope no one was offended by my show here tonight . If you were offended , you stayed all the way through it . And fuck it because you re dummy . But I want to say this , and I wasn t certain . I ll give a goddamn vote . People don t enjoy me . Because they re not going to be fans long anyway . All right then , I ll think about something . Hey , it was that thing . Thank you , I got a little song I want to do for you . This is not going to be in no movement . I don t sing that good , but I feel good . This tune is called . . . Zachary . I know why I ve waited . I know why I ve waited . I know why I ve been blue . Prayed each night for someone . He s exactly like you . Why should we spend money ? On a show or two . No one does those love scenes . It s exactly like you . You make me feel so grand . I want to hand the world to you . You seem to understand . Each foolish little dream . Steam , I m steaming . </s> <s> Now I know I m mother . She taught me to be true . She meant me for someone . She meant me for someone . She meant me for someone just like you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Have a big day . Have a big day . Have a big day . Have a big day . Have a big day . Have a big day . Have a big day . Have a big day . Have a big day . Have a big day . Have a big day . Have a big day . Have a big day .

        "transcript": "<s> What the hell are you doing in my office ? You re a white kid . I don t get white kids in here . You ve been in half the year and you ve been in more trouble than most kids get in their lifetime . My understanding is you ve been at 11 schools in seven years and your behavior has not changed which is troubling . You moond the cafeteria like anybody wants to see that . Stole the candy money from the fundraiser and bought McDonald s for you and your friends . Stole the teacher s grade book and changed all the grades . He gave yourself two sea monoces and a D . Climb an eight story building and took a do do off the building . That s nasty . Hey , do you think this is funny ? You ve been in countless fights , handed out spreadsheets and started a gambling pool . Goodness . It s like Godfather too . Son , why do you want to be when you grow up ? Superhero . Superhero . Let s be realistic . I won t play for Dallas . I probably have a better chance of being a superhero . I m going to give you one week in house suspension , no recess . Damn . Hey ! You watch your mouth . My call your mom , have her come up here . Whoop you . Now , while you re in there , want you to think about it . What you ve done and what you want to be when you grow up because this behavior , you re not going to be able to do anything . You dismissed . I know what I can be . Ladies and gentlemen , Brent Ernst . Thank you guys for coming out . I know the big games tomorrow . I m in the Super Bowl , cares . I got no money on it . I don t give a fuck . Well , I m a former degenerate . I still gamble , but whatever . My wife knows I bet , but she doesn t know . That s why I hate watching football winner because I ll be young at the TV . She s like , it s just a game . No , the fuck it s not . We got Brent right , not this motherfucker . That s why I married her . She s a good kid . No , she is . I mean , she s got a normal family , which that really threw me off because I grew up in dysfunction . And if you grow up in dysfunction , it throws you off when you meet normal people . I don t know if that s ever happened to anybody . Because you don t know how fucked up your life is until you meet . Like a fish doesn t know it s wet . You like that ? I read that on a magnet . No , it was weird , man . Like the first time I met a family , it threw me off . I was like , she had a dad . I m like , oh , this guy s been with you your whole life ? All of you had the same last name . Same dude from beginning and end . No step . No , get the fuck out . Are you serious ? </s> <s> I m poking him and shit . Well , I m not even . Nobody I knew growing up had dads . Everybody s single mom . Well , there was one kid who had a dad . Like we heard about him , but nobody ever really met the kid . And why is that ? You know , it s always a dad that s fucking a family up . It s very rare . I don t mean to pick on fathers . I m just saying , you know , you re the one handing out the issues . It s usually the dad . Like , you know , you never hear of a mom having like a whole other family . Nobody knows about it . You know what I m saying ? There s no mom setting up apartments for their side deck . Yeah . It s always the dad . Yeah , my real father , man , he was , well , he had a schizophrenia . You know what that is ? Well , you hear voices and shit . And then he ended up killing himself when I was like 10 . Or , oh , by the way , before I go any further , I just want to let you people know I like to talk about shit that s uncomfortable . And personal to me , if I touch on something personal to you , just , you know , go home and cry about it . Seriously , I don t want to talk to your bitch ass out front . I m just saying , if you re an adult and you re not emotionally stable , you re not going to be in a room with other adults listening to another adult talk about adult shit , then , you know , go home and kill yourself like my father did . No , you d be listening . You d be surprised , all right ? It s a very rough time to be a comedian . Everybody s feelings are coming into comedy clubs . Like , you know , I m saying that I got people upset with me . I got a mental health group that s upset with me because they think I m making fun of schizophrenia , you know . I m just saying , I m going to ruin your career . What career ? What the fuck are you going to ruin ? You can t get blood from a stone . I read that on a magnet too . The reason thing , I m not making fun of schizophrenia . I don t think it s funny . It s not a funny , you know , illness or whatever to grow up around . And those , you know , but the shit they do . They hear voices , you know what I mean ? Like , my dad would fucking , he thought trees would talk to him , like , little animals and shit . Squirrels , he had something against squirrels . I don t know , I m dead serious . Like , whenever he saw squirrels , it was on . </s> <s> Because he would start arguing with the squirrels . And in his defense , I don t know , something might have been going on . Because the squirrels were ain t it ? Like , they didn t run enough . Even as a kid , I remember going to my mom . I m like , my , you think it s a good idea to let them talk to the squirrels ? Because they re pissing them off . We don t know what the fuck to tell them . I don t want to get shot in my sleep because the squirrels are like , kill the family . You know what I mean ? Get rid of every potty . You ll be happier . I think it was drugs , though . Well , we had , we had some drug abuse in my family , which , you know , again , I find humor in that shit , too . Maybe I m not wired right . I don t know if you ever had a family member go through like a 12 step program . But there s like a step where they apologize to you for shit that you didn t know they did . I m like , uh , that s where my Easter money went . But you helped me look for it . Well , not . That s why , you know , I don t , look . And by the way , I don t count weed as a drug or mushrooms , but everything else , you know . But because that hard course , you ever meet those asshole people that are like , you know anything in moderation . You know , you ever meet that dick ? That s never seen a fucking thing in their life . You can t do heroin in moderation , all right ? But we do , you know , it gives a fuck about pot . I think it should be legal . My dad smoked a shitload of weed . That I remember . Because I used to have to pick the seeds out for him as a kid . By the way , if you re under 30 , you don t know this , but potty stuff seeds in a back in a day , all right ? You fucking kids are spoiled . You d be like , get over here . You got little fingers , right ? And I used to have to pick the seeds out . And here s the thing , if you didn t get all the seeds out of there , we re smoking a death shit with pop , right ? So you d be like , f k . He s like , get over here . I give you one job . Like I m six , you wacky motherfucker . Why don t you have the goddamn squirrels take the seeds out for you ? But I never smoked pot . I never tried it , man . I m for it , 200 . But I don t , I m not going to try . First of all , you know , because I am , I don t trust myself with anything . I ll be honest . If I smoke weed , next thing , then I m like , everybody on the f king floor , you know what I mean ? </s> <s> I m zero to 100 real quick , real quick . And I know I m fucked up , man . I was getting in trouble , you know , without doing that shit . I was always in trouble as a kid , man . I was a horrible kid and a bad early adult . My true calling in life is stealing . I don t do it anymore , but I m good , man . I do , I know the scam . That s how my mind works . I see everything in angles . Like me and my wife went to the 99 cent store , right ? My first thought is I d have to steal over 500 items in order to be charged with grand larceny . You know what I mean ? Who f king wrong with ? But as a kid , I used to rob , well me and my little brother used to rob everything together , you know . Well , we used to help my mom out because we grew up pretty broke , not just comic broke , but like , like free lunch program . That s how you know you re broke , by the way . You re on the free food programs at the f king shitty public schools . Well , you had three lunch programs . You had the paid lunch , right , for the kids who ate cash . Then you had reduced lunch , I guess , for the kids who kind of had cash . And then you had free lunch , right ? And you had to stay in line like a dick with this little raffle ticket . Even the reduced kids are staring at you like , like , dude , lunch is 50 cents . How broke is your f king family , man ? Oh , you know , you re really broke if you were on free breakfast . That s such a sh . I had to be at the bus stop at like 3 . 30 in the morning . It s cold and dark . It s like me , my little brother , and the f king squirrels . No , but we would , I m not sugar coating this , right ? Because people do shit like that . I m just being honest . We would steal , but we would do things that help my mom out , you understand ? Because she was always struggling and sh . So as a son , you want to provide , you know ? Like , I d turn into like a little Liam Neilson . I went to my mom . I said , I have a special skill set . I ve developed others . Certain amount of time . So basically , yeah , we , we , me and my brother are always scamming . Like , we dressed up as boy scouts and collected money for like a month . That was f king strong . That was my idea , by the way . I came up with , well , that s how my mind works . I saw these boy scouts collecting for the boy scouts and people were just throwing them cash , right ? So my first thought is , how to f king know their boy scouts ? </s> <s> Like , you don t know . No , you re assuming , but you don t really know . You never check a boy scouts credentials . You know what I mean ? You never give them a rope and be like , hey , make me a whinzer , not , you know what I mean ? You re just assuming because he has the outfit on . So me and my brother got outfits and we went door to door . We were killing it . But how we got caught was is my mom got off of work early , right ? And she went to the grocery store and me and my little brother had set up a table in front of the grocery store . Right ? I ve said , we had to buck it . People just throwing his cash . I m like , thank you . Thank you . Turn around . There s my mom . I m like , oh , f k . You know what I m saying ? What the hell are you guys doing ? I m like , trying to pay the phone bill , Carol . Just trying to help out here . Here s the money . Don t get some groceries . Don t worry about it . Do Carol beat the f k out of me and my little brother ? She kept the money though . I ll tell you that . I was so goddamn awful . Like I robbed the book fair . You remember the book fair in fifth grade ? Remember that s Galactic Book Fair card ? Yeah , I took that bitch down . I did . I paid for Jam the door so they thought it was locked . Then I came back later , kicked the door open and housed everything . And the whole school knew it was me . Well , I told everybody . You know what I mean ? I had to move product . I did . I had this black market book fair business just going up to kids like , hey , how you doing ? Listen , I got you a meal , you a bedelia if you re interested . I got the whole super fun series . Judy Bloom . Goosebumps , whatever . Dude , I got so much trouble . Well , here s the thing . If you re a single mom and you have a kid and this for people watching at home , all right , I m going to tell you , especially your son , all right . I m going to tell you how to handle a son . I don t know about daughters because you know , I m not a daughter . Well , then let s be honest . When women , when you re acting up , you don t do the shit little boys do . You know what I mean ? You re not robbing things . And when girls act up , the worst thing you do is like , I don t know , sneak out at night and blow your boyfriend a son . You re like fucking the whole neighborhood . </s> <s> That s how you act out . But that s why dudes , young dudes , are always in jail . So I m going to tell you what to do , all right . Now , because you can hit your kid , all right , you can hit him . But it ain t going to do anything . All right . And I m not saying don t hit him . You re a fucking out of him . But that s more for you so you feel better . You know what I m saying ? It s not going to deter him anyway . Here s what you do , moms . It s very simple and you know this already . Just cry . Seriously . Because this , it fucks us up if you make it as a dude . Like there s this little bitch ass gene that kicks in . You re like , how did I make my mom cry ? You know , because we can t filter it . Here s the thing . I went to 15 different schools growing up , one high school . OK , I was always moving . And that s also how you know you re broke when you re always moving and shit , like in a middle of the night . You ever have to break a lease as a family ? Like why are we leaving the furniture ? Let s go now . So this happened in the state of Florida . Now , now what happened was , I got fifth grade . I got really sick . OK , I had pneumonia . And then when I came back , I got suspended . I robbed the book fair . OK , same story , not a call back . This is just . . . And then when I came back from suspension , me and my little brother were at the bus stop , right ? And it just dawned on me that if we don t go to school , nobody s going to fucking know . So we cut school for like three weeks straight . All right ? And I would have gotten away with it , but what happened was , my class thought I got sick again , OK ? And they made me get well cards with like macaroni shells and shit . Remember that ? And they dropped them off at the house . You know what my mom s like ? What do you mean ? Brett s been in school . I m like , fuck , right ? That the whole class dry snitched on me . So my mom beat the fuck out of me . She used the phone book , by the way . I ll tell you why . She was dating a cop at that time who later became my stepfather . That s a whole other fucking story . But I m convinced that he told her like that s how you could beat people without leaving marks . Because the phone book just came out of fucking left field . And then she grounded me , right ? But in my mind , after I m done , like , what am I going to get into next ? I didn t give a fuck . And I also decided with the true and officer every day . He was like a cop for kids or whatever . </s> <s> So now I m in my classroom , right ? This is fifth grade . And while I m sitting there , I m doing my work . A fun cop comes to the door . And he says , we need to see Brett Ernst , right ? And all the kids are like , ooh . Because you know if the cops come for you in fifth grade , you re a badass . And I played it up like , wonder what I did now . But in reality , I m like , what the fuck did I do , right ? So the cops taking me to the principal s office , like he s trying to tell me where to go . I m like , dude , I fucking live there . I m like , norm of the principal s office . I have my own chair and shit , right ? So as soon as I walk into the principal s office , I see a cop , another cop , my little brother , the principal , some dude in a suit , and my mom , right ? And they re arresting my mother . Now , in the state of Florida , because I miss so much school , it was a form of child neglect , right ? So the state stepped in to take us away from my mom , right ? And I just , they were , I started freaking out . I m like , what the fuck ? My little brother was doing a little brother thing where he s just like , ah ! He s like , this is your fault . You know , I m like , I know , dude , we re in over our heads , right ? So I m serious , man . I swung on the cop . I m like , leave my mom alone . I m crying . My mom s crying . The whole fucking principal s office is crying , right ? So the cop being a man , he s like , look , I can t arrest his kid s mom . It s , you know , parent that she s a good woman , right ? So they made me sign this fucking contract . Made me read me the law that if I cut school one more time before my 18th birthday , my mother would go to jail , okay ? Fast forward , sophomore year of high school . LAUGHTER So I m hanging out with my friends , right ? You know , my buddy s like , yo , dude , let s cut class . I m like , I can t . He s like , why ? I m like , because my mom will go to jail . So what the fuck are you talking about ? I m like , dude , I cut a lot of school in fifth grade , all right ? </s> <s> Now there s a law . Like , it s something to do with neglect is some shit . I m not risking my mom s freedom . All right , I ll do whatever the hell you want to do . I m just saying , cut in school . He s like , dude , that s the dumbest shit I ve ever heard , man . That shit don t make any sense , right ? She staged the whole thing . No , seriously , like , I started doing the math . I m like , wait a minute . This fucking doesn t make any sense . All right ? I do for like five years . I thought if I cut school , my mom would go to fucking jail . And I was , hey , I went home like , what the fuck ? How could you lie to me ? She s like , you believe that shit ? She s , what do you want me to do ? You kids are horrible . It s amazing . I wouldn t cut school one day , but I stole a fucking car in middle school . Well , because I knew I was risking my mom s freedom . It was just mine . Yeah , I stole a car . Why didn t actually steal it ? I just rode shotgun and laughed the whole fucking time . My best friend stole it . And he was that kid . I don t know . Well , every guy , you have that one friend . You ever got one friend growing up ? You just knew it was going to go to jail . You know what I mean ? Like that one piece of shit kid with like no adult supervision . You ever that kid ? A motherfucker like the kid was always outside . Like , you ever that outside kid ? It s like the Wednesday at midnight and he s just outside and shit hanging out . It s like , dude , where s your family ? This kid , man , this kid was out of his mind , man . He was like a penis character , really ? He wore the same shit every day and he had no parents . I don t know . Dude , this kid , I m not even , this kid was the craziest kid . He s a legend where I m from . The kid was out of his fucking mind . Dude , he s still in ambulance , alright ? At 12 . That s the greatest thing you could ever see as a 12 year old , by the way , is your best friend steal a fucking ambulance . Well , what happened ? The drivers pulled up , right ? And the ambulance driving , they got a call for you or something and they left the keys in the ignition , right ? So my boy was like , yo , be let s take the ambulance . </s> <s> I m like , uh , no , B . The fuck is wrong with you ? Right ? So he just ran and then he got into the ambulance , right ? And this is , to me , this is the funniest part of the old story , alright ? You may not find this funny , but I think it s hilarious . He was trying to get the sirens on first . Like , that was his . . . Like , that was his first priority . Like , all you heard was like , and in the paramedics were in the store going , holy shit , there s a kid in the ambulance , right ? Then he got him on and was like , and he just took off . We were like , holy shit . And he didn t even go anywhere . He was just doing laps with the fucking ambulance , right ? And we were cheering him on . And then the cops were there immediately , right ? And then he jumped out on foot and . . . Dude , they beat the fuck out of that kid . By the way , that s the second greatest thing you could ever see as a 12 year old . There s your best friend getting kicked to sleep by the Pasek New Jersey police department . Dude , they were . . . Remember that scene in Goodfellas with Billy Bats ? They were just . . . Dude , they beat . . . I thought they killed the kid . He was just laying there like a dick . And then they just threw him in the bag of the ambulance and took him to the fucking hospital . We were cheering . . . No , here s my theory . Here s why I think kids in middle school lose their mind . Because you re not defined . You know , you don t know where you re at in the kid hierarchy . You re in , like , kid purgatory . You know what I mean ? Because you got , like , one foot and being a little kid and any other foot and being a fucking filthy teenager . You know what I mean ? You re , like , both . Like a hybrid . Because . . . No , because I remember in middle school , like , I m trying to finger bang Jessica Lisa . But I m still watching , like , Saturday morning cartoons . It s confusing , you know what I mean ? Oh , wow . Like , even a night that I stole the car , I went home and put on a Dallas Cowboy 1Z pajama outfit . Like , I was kind of a thug where it s footsees , you know what I mean ? And then you get to middle school and it s even more confusing because you expect everybody to be cute and little . Like , elementary school . Which most kids are . Right ? But then there s those old ass kids . </s> <s> . . That , like , hip puberty way too early in life . You ever have those adult kids in middle . . . They should have their own goddamn school , by the way . Like , why are they intermixing with real little kids ? Like , you ever have that chick with tits that could fight ? You ever have that dude in middle school look like a fucking grown man ? Delante . Delante was like six foot in middle school , okay ? And he had a beard , all right ? And not like a five o clock shadow , like a Kimbo slice , Rick Ross . He had a dick . He had a real dick in middle school . He had a grown adult dick . I know this because he used to show everybody . He was always taking his root out in the hallway . Do I remember staring at him as a kid ? They can like , how the fuck are you 12 ? Like , what are you Benjamin Budden ? How old are you Delante ? He was old as . . . I think he was divorced to something . He was just . . . I hated Delante though . Well , he was the school bully , you know what I mean ? He was like , everybody was afraid , the teachers were afraid of Delante . Anyway , this was in South Florida , Delante . I stole the car in New Jersey , but this was in South Florida . Why I went to three middle schools ? So that s what happened is we were in New Jersey . My mom s like , this place is terrible . There s a lot of drugs and crime . Let s move to South Florida . And Delante , everything he said with old pussy ass , it s all he never said . He said , oh , pussy ass , fuck it . Like , that s all he talked like . And they call white people crackers . I don t know if you know that . Like , old pussy ass , crack , old fuck cracker . He s like , oh , hello , Delante . How s it going ? It s a fuck you old bitch ass , pussy ass . Right ? He had a mouthful of gold teeth . So whenever he talked , he s fucking going , pussy ass , fuck it . Oh , fuck boy . You hear that ? Oh , fuck boy . He called me a dick in the booty ass cracker . One whole dick in the booty ass , fuck it . Dude , my schools were rough , man . They were rough as shit . And that s the other thing . When you re white and broke , you re fucked . Nobody gives a shit . They re like , hey , you re white . Just be happy with that . You know what I mean ? Like , we had a day in my school . If this were the other way around , people would have been marked . It would have been hashtags everywhere , all right ? It was called cracker knockout day . Google it . It s a real thing . </s> <s> It still goes on . It s like a fucking tradition in South Florida . Cracker day was the worst , man . Teachers didn t even show up for that shit . And that s the day the brothers would knock at all the white kids . All five of us . Sucked ass , man . And that s why I hate black history month . I don t like it . Not a fan . I don t like it . Not a fan . Well , it always happened in February , right ? Because they would show those civil rights videos in auditorium getting brothers all amped up and shit . And you feel them staring at you . And it s like , I didn t do anything . I m all free breakfast , man . Fuck you old pussy , right ? Dude , delante , man . That dude , man . Dude , delante , man . That dude , man . He was not , he knocked that . He knocked me out . I got knocked out by him three times , man . Well , I got stole on Cracker Day . I don t know if you know what stole means , but stole means like when somebody hits you without you seeing it , right ? Because you re just walking down the hallway and then , right ? And by the way , getting knocked out doesn t really hurt , right ? It s just more embarrassing than anything . If you ve never been knocked out before , this is what it s like , all right ? You hear a noise , which is your face . And then , this is what blink real quick and go , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , right ? And you re like , oh , I don t know if I did my math homework to like , you have no idea what just happened . And to be honest with you , all right ? If you put a gun in my head and ask me how many fights I ve been in my life , I can t put a number on it , all right ? And I m not trying to be a tough guy just it is what it is . But I ll tell you this much . I got about 19 strong losses , like fucking epic . Like in the hospital just bleeding , laying there like a dick . By the way , we re friends on Facebook now . I m the half of that scared . He hit me up to play Candy Crush . I feel like , oh , pussy ass , Candy Crush ass . But as a kid , I couldn t , I wanted to fight him , you know ? And he has a thing too , man . Like I didn t realize what I looked like . Because you ever picture yourself as a kid , right ? And then you see a picture of yourself and it s nothing . What you thought you looked like . You know , you re like , what the fuck is that ? Because I saw a picture of myself and that at that age . Now in my mind , I thought I was just a little aversion when I looked like now . First of all , I was fat as shit , right ? </s> <s> I was a fat little kid . And I used to stutter really bad . You ll pick up on it now . I m better now . And I used to list . I was all fucked up . But like , you guys want them booked , right ? And I m dead ass . And I brow everywhere in the picture , right ? I m serious . I was in mid list . I m looking . I m like , that s what I look like . Do my wife said the funniest thing . She said , she said , I look like I smell like cheese . But I showed her Delante . I said , baby , come here . How old do you think this fucking kid is ? She s like , what is that ? You got it , it s counselor ? This motherfucker was in a suit . He had a cane . His little ear book quote , oh , plus a is , dot , dot , you know . But no , man , I wanted to fight him . But you know , you can t fight Delante looking like you smelled like cheese . So I used to try and force puberty . Now , I don t know if any dudes ever done this move . Again , as a kid , I thought it was a good idea . But I would be in the bathroom like , hey ! Anybody ever tried that ? Like , I don t know what I was thinking . Like , I m going to push my dick out or something . You know what I mean ? And it sucks because I was a late bloomer . Like , my balls didn t drop until like my sophomore year of high school . But I don t know what , but my pubes decided to start growing in between seventh and eighth . I don t know why that happened . And then stopped growing . And they grew on the side . I don t know if anybody had that move . And don t see it for like three years I walked around with nobody hair . This little baby dick . And this weird fucking mustache . My dick looked like a hipster . Well , because it s , well , I think guys , I mean , I think , I don t know . I mean , again , I can t speak for chicks . But if I were you , like , I would be afraid of your puberty . You know what I mean ? Because that s some heavy shit to go through . Just to know , like , just the fact that you re going to grow boobs and bleed for the rest of your life would freak me the fuck out as a little girl . That s got to be frightening . Because all guys get , all we get is just awkward looking like , oh . You know what I mean ? Like , give a grow five feet in a week . You know what I mean ? You re all gangly and shit . Like , none of your appendages match . You know , everything s all weird . There s weird , I have these long legs , big feet , no calves , fat torso . My nipples hurt . </s> <s> I don t know what the fuck that was . Everybody on tender nipples ? Like , why do my nipples hurt ? I m just walking around like , oh , why is there a mustache on my dick ? Just all fucking . . . Like , you look like you ever see that thing in front of the car dealership ? This fucking thing ? But to be a girl , I d be . . . Because I d be more afraid of your first one , the first period , the one that you heard is coming , you know is coming , and I m pretty sure you weren t prepared for . And I pray you were home . Because Mother Nature don t give a fuck where you re at . Anybody ever for a girl get the period in your classroom ? Fucking top five most frightening moments of my life . Meatress , San Thiago . No , I m serious , there was just blood everywhere . Nobody knew what the . . . I thought somebody walked up behind her and was like , this is for a little puppet . I just fucking shank her through the ship . I thought she owned the Laontaine chocolate milk with some shit , you know ? Because I was just sitting there doing my work and then . . . And she sat behind me all of a sudden I just hear , somebody held me ! Somebody held me ! I turned around and I m like , oh my God ! She s like , somebody held me , right ? And the teacher was a dude , he didn t know what to do . He s like , everybody just calmed down , right ? Kids were crying and shit . I ll tell you this , I m just glad the chick with tits was in my class . Well , she jumped right up , she s like , I got this . Everybody relax , all right ? This shit happened to me in kindergarten . She just grabbed me some water and some hot towels . Dude , she had Beatrice cleaned up , everything , out five minutes . Like , nothing happened . She was like Harvey Kitell and Pulp Fiction . And Wolf , I ll tell you , I don t rough though , I was my older brother because , well , he was gay and you knew it . So his whole experience in school was way different . Especially my neighbor , the only thing that they d be like , old dick and a booty ass crack , I d be like . . . Now , we always knew he was gay , but he wasn t like , you know , like he wasn t like over the top , exhausting gay . You ever see those guys , like , hey , what s up ? Like , whoo , like that guy ? He was more subtle , but you know . Well , that s why it pisses me off when people think like , you know , people choose to be gay . No , if you lived around it , you know , they re fucking bored in that way . Like , my brother , that bitch was different from day one . </s> <s> Now , I m saying we always knew he was suspect as a kid . Well , he was just a different little , little dude , you know . He s quiet . He could draw . There s a thing too , he was really into women , which I found ironic . But like , gay dudes , like , women , they re really , like , they re into women , but they re into your beauty . No , like , he d see a girl and be like , oh my god , she s gorgeous . I need to draw her . Then he would fucking draw pictures of women . You know , like , actresses and shit . Then he would frame them and put them on his wall , right ? Which I also found ironic , you know , little gay dude , pictures of women all over his wall , right ? Little straight dude , black guys everywhere , all over my wall . And fucking Michael Jordan and Emmett Smith . But again , we knew he was gay . Like , when he came out , we had to act shocked . Well , as a family , because it was such a big deal for him , you know . Like , he called us in the living room . My mom s like , I think he s gonna tell us now . He s like , act surprised . I was trying not to laugh the whole fucking time . She s like , listen , I gotta tell you guys something . Oh , no , really ? We had no idea . Really , you had the whole family fool , man . I ll tell you , it was a hand drawn pictures of Susan Lucci on your wall . Really threw us for a loop . I remember going to my mom , thank God . Now we get to make fun of him and front of him . In 19 years , a good joke , except that God damn window . He was a tough kid , though . My brother could fight . He wasn t like , that s the other thing . My little brother could kick my ass , and my older brother could kick my ass . But it s okay , my little brother , because he s bigger than me . But to have your gay brother beat the fuck out of you . But he was into regular dudes . That s the other thing . He dated dudes like gay dudes that you didn t know were gay . He dated a guy that was ex special forces . Who knew everything about sports . We used to bet together , and I made a kill with that cock sucker . No pun intended . I ll be honest with you , though . I don t care how open minded you claim to be as a person . There is nothing more awkward than talking football with another man while he s sitting on your brother s lap . I m just putting that shit out there . He s got his arm over my brother s shoulder . </s> <s> Like , hey , should we take the over and under on Monday night ? I m like , well , maybe we should start by taking your arm from over my brother s shoulder . I don t want to say anything , because I m my brother who s bad about who he is . And I don t want to get the shippied out of me at a Christmas Eve party . Before the fish comes out . It s a joke for the Italians . They ll get that at home . Now , but Scotty , man , I don t know if you noticed , but I m speaking past tense . Because I ended up losing him too , man . Which , you know , that really fucked with me . Because he was like my father in a sense , because he helped raise me . And especially when I got married , I really wanted him with me for that whole process . Because he could have helped my wife play in the fucking thing , and I would have had it been involved . I would have had explained the bachelor party , though . But he s like , why the fuck we out of play ? Mr . Just . . . Let him do what he does , all right ? We ll hit the strip club after the pottery class . Now , eat your fucking keish and enjoy this . I ll tell you , I don t know if any dude s been through the wedding planning . . . Oh , it s got awful . That s another reason why I m for your gay marriage . Well , weddings ain t for straight dudes . All right , let s be honest . That s got nothing to do with us . I mean , it s not even our party . We don t even need to fucking be there . Seriously , nobody gives a shit with it . Nobody gives a fuck about the groom . Nobody stands when I walk into the room . I come out first like a dick , like , m moo . Standing there for eight hours , sweating . She gets music . Everybody stands and it s my day . I m a princess . Everybody bowed . And her father s like , hey , take him . It s like going ahead with that financial liability . I saw this dude doing math when he dropped her off , man . He was just deducting shit . No more cell phone , no more health insurance , no more . Here you go , kid . It s the best day ever . And financially , it s the biggest kick in the ball as you can get . Other than , you know , betting Dallas on Thanksgiving . No , it s a , and as a dude , you re already tapped out and exhausted from the whole engagement ring searching process , which , you know , you want to talk about inequality . This is inequality . Right ? Holy shit , man . You have no idea , man . I was , you know , investigating diamonds . I didn t know how much they fucked it were . </s> <s> I learned about their SPF or whatever it is , like the clarity . And it s a lot of pressure on a man to get the ring . You understand ? Because , you know , God forbid , we just focus on the love , right ? Right ? Because that s what it s about . Gotta get the right , wait , what is it , women ? What the fuck ? Why are you so obsessed with rings ? I don t , I don t get it . Like , what do you hobbits of some shit ? Like , you know , let me see the ring . Oh , oh , you guys love rings . You even make rings up . Have you ever promised ring ? Have you ever had that bullshit ? It s a fucking scam , dude . It s another excuse for them to get rings . If you don t know what a promise ring is , it s a ring promising her an engagement ring , which leads to a wedding ring , see ? See what you re doing ? What do you need three rings for ? What are you fucking Saturn ? I had the other thing , like , that s the one I was looking forward to getting engaged . I planned everything . I practiced my pitch , you know what I mean ? Like my little speech . I m dead serious . But here s what happens . The minute you start dropping to a knee , they start freaking the fuck out , right ? And she starts making like , baby seal , and I m like , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , right ? And I m trying to throw my pitch at it . You know , my whole life , I ve been waiting to use that rocky two line . You know what he was in front of the tiger cage ? I m like , yo , what are you doing the next 40 , 50 years , right ? Dude , she baby sealed all over the fucking rocky two line . The whole rocky two line done . So once we got engaged , is you happy ? Yeah , it s okay . So my , it s great . Now , go playing your party . I don t want to be involved . Go do the wedding . I m not gonna . . . Seriously , I m not offering anything . I m not bringing anything to the table other than just , you know , logic and fiscal responsibility . So go playing your party . And they make you involved , man . Every woman in the family , they turn on my mom turned on me . Because they re , they re sitting there playing it shit and you re like , uh , excuse me , why do we have to rent napkins ? </s> <s> Why don t we just use the napkins that come with the food ? I don t know why . Well , because those are off white , not a cream . And you don t know what the fuck you re talking about . You re like , okay , fine . And mom s like , shut up . Her grandmother , her mom , her sister , everybody . Cousins . It s like , why am I here ? Then you just start agreeing to everything , even though you , you know , you re getting robbed . You know , you re just sitting there going , oh , yeah , a harp . That s a great idea . We really need a harp . No , it s , what , 1 , 300 for some chubby bitch to play for 40 minutes ? We better fucking , we better jump on that , man . That , that sounds like a real bargain right there . And I don t even know if she was good , it just sounded like the same song . I sound like one song . It sounded like somebody was grating wishes and doing magic for fucking 40 minutes . Did she , she ate all of our shrimp ? No , I m saying I caught her stealing shrimp , man . And I obsessed on that . Like that , that bothered me . My wife s like , why , why do you care ? She s not stealing it . It s included . We already paid for her . I m like , no , she s stealing the shrimp because she fucking thinks she s stealing the shrimp . And it s , it s the principal . She did , she ate , though , we had a robber , right ? She was eating fucking oysters on her chest , like an honor . I m serious , she just cracking oysters on her chest . I can saw around the harp , but just shrimp tails and cockles shells . I said , I went up to her , I confronted her . I said , come here , I said , listen . We both know , we both know what you did . Right ? We both know , no , no , no . You know what you did ? No , I told her , she s like , I caught you stealing shrimp , right ? Now , it s just gonna happen . You re gonna play the harp now for the fucking flower , right ? And you re gonna enjoy yourself , okay ? You don t have to sneak food like an animal , right ? This is an Italian wedding . Everybody sits , everybody eats , the fucking valleys , everybody . Everybody sits , we re all family tonight , okay ? So you play harp for an hour , okay ? Then when you re done , you can sit down , you can have your choice , and fucking whatever vegetarian shrimp , fish , whatever fucking , you probably eat every entree we got . It s fine . It s all covered , okay ? You could drink all night , it s an open bar . All right ? Get hammered . Have fun . I m pretty sure one of my degenerate friends is gonna try and fuck you . </s> <s> What you played at harp ? Listen , she s an asshole for playing a harp anyways , all right ? It s a dick instrument . Seriously , what are you , a mythical creature ? Who the fuck ? I ll tell you another scam is that fucking save the date card . What a goddamn , I wish I thought of that shit . That s like one of the greatest scams of all time . It goes Ponzi scheme , dressing up as a boy scout and collecting money , and then save the day cards . Now , and if you don t know what those are , those are cards that you buy , that you mail people to let them know you re gonna mail them a fucking card . That s like me calling you going , hey yo , hang up , I m gonna call you . I think you charged me 300 for the first fucking phone call . And you know why they want the engagement cards is that s where they get to show off those fucking horrible gay ass engagement photos they make you take . And let s be honest , there s no word to describe it other than gay , all right ? It s gay as shit . It s so gay , it s so gay that if my gay brother was alive , he d be like , dude , this is the gay as shit I ve ever seen in my life . All right , and I ve seen some hardcore gay sh , I ve seen gay shit where there s just dicks everywhere and this is gayer . You could have been blown to dude , taking in the ass , watching Glee , and that would have still been 10 times more masculine than these engagement photos . And they re all alive , the whole thing s alive . They re just pictures of us doing stuff as a couple we ve never done before in our life . I m a goddamn grown man , throlicking , every photo , jumping in the air , yeah everywhere , just jumping . And why are we jumping in the air ? Like , what do we win a car or something ? What the fuck ? And why are we wearing shoes ? Why can t we wear shoes ? Like , what does that got to do with being in love ? Who walks barefoot in Chicago ? That s what we took our engagement photos in Chicago , you know , because that s where we met . So we re just fucking throlicking . And every photo that makes the guy look like a goddamn cuckold . By the way , anybody who laughed at that watch is porn . Dude , there s a picture of us holding hands , right ? Walking in a sunset ? Get the fuck out of here , we never did that . And in reality , what asshole couple does that in real life ? You know what I mean ? </s> <s> Like , seriously , what annoying hamster couple ? And we re like , oh yeah , no , that s our thing . No , man , sunrise is in sunsets , it s what we do . It s like we get up early , we have coffee , right ? And then we walk around all day , and we make sure not to let each other go . And then , at the end of the day , we like to watch the sunset , and we walk towards it for no goddamn reason . And then we jump in the air and get stuck . I ll kill everybody . I got a Yorkie now . And I ll be honest with you , I love the dog , but you know , she s obsessed with the fucking dog . She does take pictures of goddamn dog . She ll call me in a living room or something . She ll be like , get in here , like I ll be working . Like , I think there s a problem . She s like , look , and the dog s just fucking eating breakfast . It s not doing it . And then we re staring at the dog , and then the dog s creeped out because it feels a staring at it . It s like , she s like , get the camera , right ? I m trying to get the dog to smile . I ll be honest with you , though , it is cute . If you re left alone for a while , I don t know if it sucks you in . Like , yeah , I m alone with a story staring at me . I m like , what the fuck do we want ? Do we want ? Are you hungry or some ? Do you want a drink ? Do you want a treat ? Is that what you want ? Is that what you want ? You want your sweet toy ? Where s your sweet toy ? Where s your sweet toy ? This sweet toy , right ? The fucking thing just takes off , and you can tell it s thinking , I got him . You know what I mean ? It is , man . It s so cute . I hate being around it , man . This is fucked up . It s so cute , I want to hurt it . You know what I mean ? Now , don t give me , I don t mean like , throw him up against the wall as some shit . I mean , like , you ever , like pet him , and then just squeeze it a little and it goes , you re like , it s okay . It s okay . I m here to protect you . I m here to protect you . From me . I just , well , all right . My goal is to stay mad . I just want to be married for the rest of my life . I don t want to fuck it up . I want what my grandparents had . You know what I mean ? No , I m serious . </s> <s> That s all I want . My grandparents were married over 60 something years . You know what I mean ? That s what I want . I want that , you know , a lot of that I had to do with . Well , my grandfather cheated on her whenever younger . She took him back and I think that helped because that was a wrap . That motherfucker never said anything ever again . Like , you know , like , never won an argument . Nothing . I m dead serious . Like , she d be like , I feel like going to the movies . He d be like , I feel like sitting home today . Well , I didn t feel like you fucking that flapper back in 1920 . All right . Let s go get your coat . You know , we weren t even married yet , but that s okay . I was just overseas fighting for the country . Life was rough for him , man . You know , my grandfather was always ready to get down . He used to make weapons . I can t weapons all at the same time . He always used old man weapons and shit like they would make like in the shed . My grandfather had a sock with like 900 worth of quarters in it . He was fucking out . He ever seen a shit they would make ? He had an axe handle that was like this big , right ? That he would keep under the seat of his Lincoln , that he would drive around with tape at the bottom of it . I guess for grip , right ? And then a fucking nail in the top of it . I remember as a kid going , what s that for ? He s like , just in case . I mean , in case of what ? Like , what are you brave are ? What the fuck is that thing ? By the way , the reason why we were in Florida is because my grandparents retired there . You understand ? So that s why my grandparents really helped raise me and my brothers . You know , we were always down there . Now , both my grandparents worked . My grandfather worked at a gas station and my grandmother worked at a bank . Okay ? Now , they used to have to get us babysitters , right ? To watch us because they both worked . Now , the whole purpose we were down there was to stay at a trouble , but it really didn t matter because me and my brothers were horrible kids . Like , we were like to Simpson kids . Seriously , we were terrible . Like , we ran through babysitter , like , like , we had this one babysitter , okay ? We used to call her ant face , right ? Now , she was this big lady from the south , right ? And she looked like this . </s> <s> And she looked like a fucking ant . That s why we called an ant face , right ? Now , if you re not familiar with Florida , there s still pockets that are very sad , like very southern . You understand ? And now , I don t know if you re familiar with a switch , you know what that is ? Okay , well , down south , when you re acting up , there s a thing called a switch . She ll be like , go outside and break me off a switch , right ? And we re from Jersey , like , what the fuck s a switch ? Well , if you don t know , they take you outside , they make you pick out a tree branch , right ? You have to break it off , you give it to them , and then they fucking hate you with it . It s like some sadistic , like , Guantanamo Bay Hannibal , like a mine , like , why do I gotta pick the weapon you re gonna beat me with , right ? So the next time we were acting up , ant face is like , go outside and break me off a switch , right ? So now , I m like , fuck you , ant face , I ain t falling for that shit again , right ? So ant face goes fine , I ll do it myself , right ? So she went outside , right ? We locked ant face out of the house for like nine hours , all right ? No , I m serious . And she was running around , like , trying to get in , like , she was doing her little old lady run , you know what I mean ? Where they re like going like this , like , and me and my brothers would open the door and clothe , like , we were messing . No , dude , my grandparents had this sliding glass door , right ? My older brother was opening and closing the curtain , and I was just doing that little kid dance , or . . . So ant face tapped out , right ? She didn t wanna watch us anymore . So now , my grandmother found this last minute replacement , and I don t know where she found this woman . There s no word to describe her other than just , like , white filth . Like , she was just white , like , she was pale and stringy hair . She had , like , scrapes and bruises and shit all like , she looked like she fell off a bike . She was all banged out , man . And her nickname was the crazy lady . That s what we called her , right ? Because , like , she would never , when she would talk to you , she would never make eye contact , right ? And whatever her last words were , she would always repeat them to herself . </s> <s> So this is the 80s , so there s no background checks , right ? So my grandmother just dropped her off . She s like , watch the kids and fucking left , right ? So I m staring at the crazy lady . She s not staring at me . Doesn t say a word , right ? She just peels off and walks into my grandparents bedroom , and she lays on their bed all day , right ? Seriously , talk to her boyfriend all day , which was cool . She didn t mess with us . We didn t mess with her . The day s going great , okay ? And the day comes . And the crazy lady calls us into the bedroom . She s like , you kids get in here . I need to know if you cleaned your room , because if you didn t clean your room , you re not going to go to McDonald s . Now , it s important to the story to know it was Filet Effish Fridays at McDonald s , all right ? Now , and the reason that s important is because when we were kids , if we were good , my grandparents would take us to McDonald s as a reward , right ? And as a kid , you know , McDonald s was the shit , man . I still get excited . You know , because they had so many things for kids there , you know , happy meals , Filet Effish es . Like , I thought McDonald s was so cool . I had a cousin Steve that worked at McDonald s , and I used to brag that I had a cousin that worked at McDonald s . And none of my friends believe me . They re like , no , you don t . And I m like , yeah , I get extra shit in my happy meal , like our new people . Right ? So now , we go to clean the room , okay ? Now , my older brother , Scotty , he s 10 , that s the gay one . I m six . My little brother Keith , he s three , so you don t really count right now , right ? So we re making a bed , we re trying to , and my older brother s gay gene kicked in , because this motherfucker could make a bed better than my grandmother . I mean , everything was perfectly folded , pillows were perfect , everything , right ? So now we call the crazy lady in , because she wanted to inspect the room . So I m like , hey , crazy lady , we re done cleaning the room , you know , you want to check it out . Now , I don t know what the fuck happened , all right ? She just started freaking out . Like , her head started going 100 miles an hour , and she was looking at the room , she s like , wow . She goes , you think this room looks clean ? It doesn t look clean to me ! And then freak the fuck out , right ? And just started messing the bed up , knocking shit off the dresser , skipping like a fucking maniac , right ? And my grandmother , you know , we re Roman Catholics , so my grandmother had those creepy St . </s> <s> Statues . She bitslaps the Peter on the floor . So my older brother was like , hey lady , why are you messing the room up ? Or she doesn t say a word , she just catches him straight shot . Just , right ? Fuck it dropped him , right ? Scotty dry , I did the little kid thing where you laugh , and then you freak the fuck out . You know , she hit him and was like , I was like , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah ! Ah , ah , ah ! All right , here s where the story gets fucked up . Now , my brother told me to do this , all right ? He denied it this whole lot , but he was looking at me bleeding , going , you know what you need to do . The crazy lady goes back into bedroom , lays back on my grandparents bed , on a stomach , and starts talking to her boyfriend on the laughing about what the fuck she just did , right ? So I walk in my grandparents room , I look at her , she s laughing , okay ? I look at my brother , he s bleeding . Under my grandfather s nut sack of change , he had this little baby axe , okay ? So I look at her , I look at my brother , I look at the axe , then I got my own voices in my head going , you gonna let her get away with that shit ? That s your brother , she bit slaps St . Peter , that s fucking sacrilege , right ? I grabbed the axe and as hard as I can , right in the back of her leg , all right ? Well , I m six years old , so it wasn t a lot of torque behind it , okay ? But it was good enough to get in there , man . And I don t know what the fuck I hit , but blood went everywhere . Long story boring , the cops come , right ? And they re interrogating me , and I m crying , you know , because I know we ain t going to McDonald s now . Like I know I fucked that up . And they re asking me questions , and I m just like , ah , right , now my grandfather comes home . Now mind you , back then , there was nothing , no cell phones , not , he just pulled up , saw an ambulance , the cops , he comes running , and he s like , what the fuck happened ? And I m just like , you know , we were a kid , he just throw out one word , I m like , McDonald s ! He s like , what the fuck , she told us to clean the room , and we couldn t go to McDonald s ! And Scotty told me to do it ! And she punts Scotty in the face , he goes , oh , what d she do ? </s> <s> I go , she punts Scotty in the face . B lines it over to her , okay ? Now she s in a blanket , she s all wrapped up , all fucking crazy , right ? Her father s there , the cops there , he walks over , he goes to the father , I feel terrible about this whole thing . Can I talk to her for a second ? I wanna make sure she s all right . He goes , hey , you okay ? Huh ? What are you like , 20 something years old , you re an adult ? Listen , if you ever put your hands on my kids again , I m gonna make one phone call , all right ? I m gonna have your head chopped off , you re gonna be wrapped in plastic , and no one will ever find you . Then he looks at me , and he goes , we re gonna McDonald s ! Listen guys , thank you so much , man , God bless you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Next , oh my God , how old are you ? I m 12 fuckboy , what you got on these jelly beans ?

        "transcript": "<s> You re not suck . You ve been so kind . It is a pleasure to be here . Some of you are asking , I wonder how much of this show will be about food ? Woo ! Play a bit . If you re here for wiki leaks , jokes , you get the wrong guy . I don t know . You know , I ve been actually trying to lose weight because the shows on TV have been scaring me . They have shows where they take big people and they throw them in vans . And they put them in caps . Didn t that happen before in history ? Happened Nazis come back . We have nutrition Nazis . So , I see you have a little Chicago hot dog on your face . Get into the van ! You are a porker ! Somebody Chicago sent me up a picture , undocked , of a weight watcher s next to a cold stone creamer . I love that picture . Because it s everywhere I am in life . With the ups and downs of my dieting , I mean , like leaving cold stone feeling guilty . I don t know , I guess it s time to go back to weight watches now . Where I m leaving weight watches going , I can t , can t get any more ! Weight watches is a great organization , but they won t let you buy more points . I m going on a crow ! I am now part of a road splinter organization where you can buy and sell points in the secondary market as needed . I m going to . . . I m going to Las Vegas here is my credit card . But then you try your dieting and you turn on TV and there s all shows about food . They have shows about just one kind of food . They have three shows on about cake . They have a show called the cake boss . This man is the boss of cake . You are the boss of cake ? I did not know you could arbitrarily make yourself the boss of a food . I am now the boss of ham . I . . . Yaaaa ! My name is Boss Harv . Please tell me . I don t think you can just make yourself boss . I think there has to be a decision made . I think the commission has to meet . There has to be a sit down . So what has decided ? What ? No . Don Buddy will be in charge of cake from West Toe Boken . To West Orange . I don t ever come to this . I m some sort of thing , you know . Covered in frosting . I don t want to smother this thing like this . Look what they did to my boy . I never wanted this for you , Michael . </s> <s> I know Santino would have to make cake . And Fredo , well , he s a queen puff . But I always thought you were going to other pastries . Maybe even pastries . Who knows ? Different types of meats and fishes . Now , I watch and watch cake shows once in a while . I think if you re watching and this is me talking , I think if you re watching cake more than one or two hours a week , you have to reevaluate your decisions in life . I don t think this more to do than watch cake . John , what you doing ? Watching cake . You re watching cake the last time we came over there . We re all going to come over and talk to you . We ve written you all letters and then you can do whatever you want . I have to take intervention . No . The thing is , is that these shows don t change very much . I like dynamic shows . You know , I like watching Lost . I didn t understand it , but I liked it . I like Family Guy Battle Star Galactica . I had a really eclectic taste , but the cake boss , I haven t seen next week s episode . But I m pretty sure it s going to be about cake . I m going to tell you what happened . Somebody s going to walk in and need a cake . You re thinking , how does he know he s a Hollywood insider ? I can get it out . After watching several episodes , it s a template . In the coming and going , buddy , it s my son s birthday . I don t know what to do . I need a cake . He really likes the movie Shrek . Can you do anything with that ? Then they interview buddy in a very serious sit down interview . And buddy screams at the TV . It was the cat s birthday . He really likes Shrek . And I m thinking , I ll get him a shot . How does he think of this ? It s like CSI cake . And now he tells you how he s going to make this Shrek cake . He ll take two regular five layer cakes , carve them into like a Shrek . Then cover it all in a lovely green , fun dark . Watch this show . You want to play a drinking game ? Whenever he says fun , don t take a drink . 15 minutes in the show , you will have to call an ambulance . Oh , please don t say fun , don t again . A fun dot was rolling . We get it . He can stop saying fun dot . It s like the sheet rock of frosting . You re building it . I understand that bakery that they have in Hoboken is amazing . And there s a two hour line to get into that bakery . I could not stand in that line . Because people walk up to me and feel that they can say whatever they want . And I don t want to hear it . Standing in a cake line . Excuse me , sir . </s> <s> Are you waiting in line for cake ? You have nothing better to do . You re right . The audiologist would drive by when I was taking my cake and beat the horn . Get out of the line . I didn t know they sold cake here . I thought it was a pharmacy . I didn t get my vitamins . My cholesterol medication . And you know what ? I ain t waiting in line outside for food . I wasn t burning Himalaya Bama . And they love the olive garden there . Now the olive garden is good . There may be things though you can have all the salads you want . Oh , you spoil me . They do use a lot of dressing in the salad though . I ve had lettuce like floating and dressing like a dead body . Oh , God , they re wack to salad . It was a hit . And in Birmingham , Alabama , people are waiting outside to get in the olive garden . They think they re an Italy . They love it there . And the nice hostess goes , you know what it s going to be about two hours ? Is that okay ? For lunch at the olive garden . Absolutely . I ll be outside . You come and get me . Make sure you look for me . Don t get that at all . My sisters got me a panini maker . I don t like paninis . First of all , my sisters very nice . They got it from me for my birthday . And I tell them , don t buy me anything . Because I don t want anything . You know what , I want to give . It s better to give them to receive . And they give some stupid . And I can t pretend anymore . I can t look at them and go . Hey , how did you know ? I was having trouble making sandwiches . And you saved me . You want to make a panini ? Get a frying pan . Put the bread on there . Put stuff in bread . Wait five minutes . Pan it over . Wait five minutes . Then punch it with your fist . Peas your panini . And . . . And the panini is so squished . You don t know what s in them . And it could be vegetables in there . I ve been into a panini and I taste in a rougola . Wait . Where did a rougola come from ? We had no rougola when I was throwing up . My mother never said , John , and once she d go out to God and pick some rougola . I ll be right back , Mom . Tomatoes , cucumbers , a rougola . No ! Get to pretentious , horrifying vegetable . People serve just so they ll look fancy and elegant . And it s the Emperor s new clothes of vegetables . I don t want to speak up . Spit it out at the table . Why do you shabby neck ? It s a rougola . It works with the rest of the salad . Yes , it does . The bitter with the dirt taste . Makes me grateful for the rest of the salad that I would ordinarily hate . I had a panini with roasted eggplant in it . </s> <s> I know eggplant . I think you know I know eggplant . There s two ways to make it . Parmesan . And a member of the family taught you how to make . We ll leave it alone . I can front people at the supermarket . I don t know . I m seeing you have that eggplant in your hand . You got like your Aunt Marie s recipe or something ? No , I just looked up on the internet . There was this little recipe . Put it down ! Get it out of your hand ! Go get some rougola . You ve done enough damage . Woo ! Martha Stewart makes me laugh . She gives you instructions to make stuff . I m waiting for her to go one day . Today we re going to build a pyramid . Based on the ancient pyramid at Giza . She says things . Doesn t she say like start with the directions where you go ? No , I ain t making this . Like , okay , break out your chestnut roasting pan . Honey ! Where s that chestnut roasting pan ? I m not much of a cook . I will admit that . It s very hard to eat more calories when you eat out . It s a proven fact . I didn t even have a toaster . I just bought a toaster recently . While I had one , but I toasted low carb bread , and it exploded . So I go to buy another toaster . I didn t want any trouble . I went to a nice store and talked to this nice young lady . I saw a toaster for 49 . I said , I ll take this toaster . It was a lovely toaster as toasters go . And she said to me , could I have your name in address ? No . You can have 49 . And I will take this toaster . And that s really all I planned on today . What do you say ? She goes , we really do want you in our system . But I m not adopting the toaster . Is this like a foster toaster program I didn t see the sign ? Once I walk out the door with this toaster . You re never gonna see it again . They want your email . They want your ad drags . You can buy shit and walk out the door . I remember that . I tell my nieces and nephews that they don t believe me . You know , you used to buy stuff and walk out the door . And they didn t ask any questions . Oh Uncle John , you tell funny stories to make people laugh . Now , they used to buy stuff and leave . And that s all that happened . To tell my brothers and sisters back , they up , tell them you used to buy stuff and leave . They go , oh , don t fill their heads with nonsense . So I go to buy my 49 toaster . And it s easy for me to say that I have lost my chair like demeanor . She said to me , would you like to buy the warranty for the toaster ? No . It s 49 . I think I m gonna absorb the risk on this one . If this toaster should break , and God forbid that day should come , I m gonna take another 49 out of my pocket and buy another toaster , because that s how I live , only age , baby . </s> <s> I m not a gambler , but I m feeling lucky today . I went to bedbath and beyond . Very nice store , but I go without a coupon , just to freak them out . They don t understand . Because everybody has coupons . A lot of you have them on you . They re this big . You look like really workers , gold and ticket . My sisters have stacks of them . They have a holster for bedbath and beyond coupons . One time I was with my sisters , and they were at the other end of the store , and they saw me at the cash register . They knew I didn t have a coupon . They jumped over people . They trampled them . You have one , get them . I m not lying . This lady thinks it s let s make a deal . I ll get 50 for a bedbath and beyond coupon . I m not going my day . One time I went to bedbath and beyond , and I didn t have a coupon . People talked about me in line . He doesn t have a coupon . Is he all right ? You don t think he s dangerous , do you ? One lady felt sorry for me . You don t have a coupon ? Do you know how to get home ? Is your name in your jacket ? They have money . Money is the original coupon . It says in God we trust . Don t you trust God ? I must say one thing about bedbath and beyond , and I do shop there . They are not fussy about the coupon . They re not looking for expiration dates . It could be from linens and things , and they d close . You could write coupon on the back of a Snickers wrapper , and I almost swipe it . I could write coupon on my ass . It s not ! That is a double coupon ! I got a bedbath and beyond without a coupon . And the cashier gives me a coupon . This is how it went . Now life is precious , and we ve got to make the most of it . And I don t have time for useless , ridiculous things . And she said , you don t have a coupon ? I said no . She said , well , here s one . Thank you . Here . Can you send ? You can send me . Wait a minute . I tell you what happened when I bought the TV . I needed a TV . And buying a TV is always such a joyous thing for me . Because when I was a kid , we had five channels on our TV . Two of them didn t work . Yeah , you know people would say these people pissed me off . Don t ever say it in front of me , and I have a Chariblet demeanor . But this makes my eye twitch . </s> <s> I was a poor when we were kids , and you know we didn t know it . Really ? Because I was poor , and I was sat another . And it really bothered me . After the fourth night of Franken Beans , I would say , hey , where poor ? And when I get older , I m talking . So to be able to go in and buy a nice TV , I just , you know , I count so many things as blessings , and just another wonderful thing in my life , and I had a great attitude . Then they started talking to the salespeople . And they said , okay , you re going to buy this TV . You need a surge protector . Okay , I don t know what a surge is . I call my brother in law . They said , I need a surge protector . What do I do ? He said , buy a surge protector . You need one . They re about 200 . If you have high end electronic equipment , it might save your equipment one day . If there is a surge , I hadn t asked the neighbors about surges . But I bought it . It was 200 . They go , no , no , no , no , no . You don t want this one . I don t even know why it s out here . Then they brought me over to the 500 one . I didn t say . You want the 500 surge protector ? I said , pray tell . What does a 500 surge protector do ? Apparently , there can be a lightning bolt from Mount Olympus that hits my condo . And I ll still be able to watch the Kate Boss . They said this surge protector is so good , your condo could blow up and the TV will still be on . The condo blows up , but I don t give a shit about the TV . I have other things on my mind , like funeral arrangements . So I bought the 200 one . Now they don t like me . I bought a 2 , 000 TV because I m not home very much . And I m on a nice TV . And they said , okay , he bought the 2 , 000 TV . What about sound ? I said , I would like it to have sound . Could I have sound , please ? They show me one of those 2 , 000 sound systems . And it s very good . My house sounds like a movie theater . But it s driving me insane . Every time the phone rings on the TV , I get up to answer the phone . She know how many times phones rang . Up and down 80 times in three hours . Hold on . This is not watching TV . This is Pilates . Rip it out . Rip it out . Then they said , then they said , okay . </s> <s> Would you like to buy the extended warranty ? Ah . And they try to scare you . They go , you know , you really should get the extended warranty . It s only manufactured as limited warranty . It s just for six months and that expires . We got to bring our guys in . And we have to bring our guys in for at least a week . Sometimes we have between two and four guys . We might have to send the TV to Japan . Could cost 80 , 000 . You could lose your home . But TV costs 80 , 000 to fix . I would throw it away . And save 78 , 000 . Oh , I told you they didn t like me . And then the guy said , I just really think , this is just like everyone does . It s just sign here . What do I need an extended warranty for ? He said , well , in case the TV breaks . The TV s going to break . I m not buying it . His eyes went dead . Nobody had ever sent that to him before . Nobody had a question . And we just sign on the dotted line . And it s wrong . And I was going to stick up for all of us . I said , the TV s going to break . I m not buying it . He said , sure , this is one of the best TVs in the store . Then what do I need an extended warranty for ? In case the TV breaks . The TV s going to break . I m not buying it . It s not going to break you . It s out of a bitch . Hold your voice down . What do I need an extended warranty ? In case the TV breaks . Just buy the warranty . You got the money . I saw you on last come , extended . That was it , me . That was Ralphie , me . Good . You can t even keep your big eyes right . Now , what do I need an extended warranty for ? He just said , shut up inside . I said , get your ass outside . He went outside and we fought . It didn t take very long . It was a tie . My next martial arts days are over . I felt very silly . I took a step back . I said a little prayer to myself . I m a better person than this . Why am I so mad ? And I looked at him . And I said , what do I need an extended warranty for ? I m going to break out not buying it . It s not going to break . I swear to God , sir . I ve been here seven years . Not women s broken . And what do I mean , extended warranty for ? In case the TV breaks , are you fat and stupid ? That s what I beat the hell out of . Now I drag him back in the store . And I flip him over . I step on his chest . I said , what do I need an extended warranty for ? He said , in case the TV breaks . Let me tell you something . You said in case the TV breaks . </s> <s> Let me give you some air . I want you to know , although you may not live through the day , I admire your tenacity . What do I need an extended warranty for ? We get a hundred dollar bonus if you buy it . Well then , I ll take it . Let me help you out . I wish we had more lights . We could just put one in my ass and put me on a front lawn in a Santa suit . Next special , we need 50 more lights around walking . The first show went very well in my producers and director . Like , we got it . You can play around a little bit . You know , say some different things . You ll be sorry . I might rip a dance . Who know , we didn t clear River Dance . Well , fuck you . I m not going to be a little bit of a loser . I m not going to be a loser . Well , fuck you . Oh . You know , I don t like to be scripted as a stand up . I have certain bits , but I like to kind of make it casual . All right , I ll get back to the special now . I , I went to a health and fitness place . I , you know . I m going to be a little bit of a player . I m going to be a little bit of a player . I went to a health and fitness place . Yes , and I had a stress test in blood work . And I go to this doctor there , wonderful lady . But my stress test in my blood work are good . And she s shocked . I mean , at least be a little happy . Don t work like horrified . I don t have anything bad . This is how she told me . I guess she bet the over . I don t know . Is this you ? These are good . Your blood pressure is 112 over 70 . We ll have that checked . It must be Celsius . Is there Celsius on that ? Now there is not . Can we have a little joy and gratitude ? Be unhealthy . The doctor of this health and fitness place told me one thing . She looked at me very seriously . And , you know , I m not getting any younger . And I was nervous for a minute . And she said , did you know that you re allergic to weas ? And I looked at her and said , but I m a weak farmer . I m allergic to wheat and I thought , oh , well , I can t harvest wheat anymore . I m handing up my sickle . Because don t friends call you in the fall and go , we re harvesting this week and you never miss . I can t . I m allergic . Then I got , wait a second , you make flour out of wheat . </s> <s> Perhaps I shouldn t quiet further . I said , what does this whole wheat thing mean to me , break down ? She said , well , do you eat a lot of gluten ? I don t know what gluten is , but I would say yes . I m fairly certain I m mostly gluten . And she said , well , you should avoid anything with gluten in it . And she said , okay , thank you and started to leave the room and I said , what has gluten in it ? You know what has gluten in it ? Everything ! Every reason to wake up in the morning . I m looking at this thing of things to avoid . And I said , check again , maybe it s just cancer . How am I going to live ? She told me to go try gluten free products . Now , I went to a health food store which was a new experience for me . And now I like shopping at health food stores . And if you want to know what the gluten free stuff is , look for a gentleman with a gun in his mouth . Because bullets are gluten free . Have you tried gluten free food ? It needs gluten . I don t know what gluten is , but apparently it s delicious . And you need to put that back in there . I tried the gluten free pasta . And at this point , I m thinking , I hope to make a gluten substitute , like a sweetened gluten . Or I can t believe it s not gluten . Now , I think we have people here that know pasta . You re a state , you re boiled . You want my people . Pasta , you re boiling water , 10 minutes or less , little olive oil , little salt . Gluten free pasta , 90 minutes . Enjoy . I ve been done that . And I tried the gluten free bread . And it made me long for low carb bread . I tried to toast it . It broke the toaster . It broke the toaster . It broke the toaster . It broke the toaster . So I shop now at these health food stores on the road . And there s some healthy things that I like . Some people there have boundary issues . They walk up to me . And one lady said to me , do you like your beef cruelty free ? Oh , yeah . I would have it no other way . Take that cow to Disney World . Put them on the rides , get them Mickey ears , couple of pictures , and whack them on the way to the airport . Didn t you like taking your picture with Mickey ? Put it right in your hoof . Don t turn around now . Vegetarians , I completely understand . You have health issues with it . You have ethical issues . Completely understand . Vegetarians said to me , but I m a vegan . What is that ? We don t eat meat or dairy . What do you do ? I ll tell you what you do . They lose their minds . Vegans go to the store and they buy 50 pound bags of almonds . </s> <s> And they make it into stuff they wish they could eat . They don t have a stove . They have a Play Doh fun factory . What you re making there , it s a pork roast . Now it s not . It s almonds mush together . Have a cheeseburger . You re losing your mind . I went to a health food store and it is not lost on me that people on a limited income cannot eat healthy . And I hope we work to change that in the future . I ve been , well listen , it s true . I try to eat berries a lot because I really like them in the art part of the superfood group . I picked up berries that were 15 . And I went , wow , I wouldn t haste what a 15 strawberry is . These better be great strawberries . I better not see any marks or anything . They better be ripe . There should be Belgian diamond merchants . In the back , looking at these strawberries . What do you think of the strawberry as Audi ? This is a good strawberry . I m not saying it s a 15 strawberry . But it s a good strawberry . A lady in the vitamin section , a beautiful lady walks up to me and said , do you clean your colon ? And I m taking , she s hitting on me . What you have in mind , baby ? I said no , I have a colon cleaning lady . She comes in twice a week . She s been with us for years . She s like family . We can t let Doris go . Someone asked me if I tried yoga , we re living in LA . Have you tried yoga ? You know , they have gentle yoga . I tried gentle yoga . You walk in , they go , take your head and stick it in your ass . I don t want to put my head in my ass . It s dark and scary in there . And there s so much gluten in there . What if I have an allergic reaction and it gets stuck ? Try to find your epipan with your head in your ass . They go , if you can t put your head between your legs , just do what you can . Well , I took a nap because they gave me a mat . I try to do this on the road , these healthy things . I was in Des Moines , Iowa . I m usually in places between two and six days . I m in Des Moines , Iowa . Nice people . I enjoy the performances . But there s not a lot to do during the day . I always make the most of it on the road . But the third day , the owner of the club says to me matter of factly . You know , there s a rib festival in town . About a thousand rib boots at the fairground . </s> <s> Would you be interested in something like that ? Get in the car ! So we go to the Iowa State Fairground and it s filled with ribs . You know , I had my monogram ribbib that it carried with me on the road . Well , thank God I packed it . You should see me in my monogram ribbib . I m adorable . It looks like a Bob s people . I come to life . I have my bottle cholesterol medication for the dry rub . And I m happy . There was a long line , but I didn t think that my brain would start . Because all you could get , or a half a rack of ribs or a whole rack , it s going to move . Now , people watch the rib boss or a rib show . Now everybody s an expert . They re asking questions to the rib guy . What kind of wood do you use in your smoker ? Get out of the line . Is this a vinegar based barbecue sauce ? Get out of the line . Is there cayenne pepper in this dry rub ? Get out of the line . Then I was almost going to get ribs . I had a couple in front of me . And then it was me . I was home free . I was going to get my ribs and have fun and be a festival . But the couple in front of me , they were chatty . They wanted friends more than they wanted ribs . They looked very nice . They couldn t yell . You know , I had to internalize it . Get out of the line . Get out of the line . Get out of the line . See , they were talking about the fact that they re from Nebraska . And they had driven them . They re brand new in a bagel . Well , it s not brand new , 9 , 000 miles . But it might as well be brand new . They bought it from the neighbor across the street . His wife had a stroke . And they couldn t travel as much as they had wanted to . Now , Evelyn and George had lived with them for over 23 years . Their kids grew up together . They went to the same grammar school . People sent to the Catholic school . Not that the schools in the area aren t wonderful . They are . And then they went on to the Catholic high school . They had a very good football team . And our sons played together . Now , when Mary had the stroke , we re at the hospital every day . And I think they were done saying things . Get out of the line . I don t remember what happened after that . I guess I got ribs . I woke up in the woods . There were bones everywhere . I hope I didn t stock and kill a deer . That would be awful . </s> <s> Last year , I went on a tour of Canada . And it was amazing . I love Canada . I will work there forever . It is a lot of traveling . And it is becoming harder and harder to fly now . First of all , the restrictions are draconian at this point . They won t even check you in . I m going to Las Vegas . They just stare . They punch in the computer . And then they say , go check in over there . There s a machine . Check yourself in . I m going to Las Vegas . Yeah , well , check it over there . We don t check people in . You check yourself in . Do you have your confirmation number ? Do you have your confirmation number ? I give you money . And you said you would fly me to Las Vegas . We had a deal . Well , you have to , sir , it will tell you how to check yourself in . But I don t work here . Do I have to deice the plane too ? How much help do you need ? Let me know the luggage for you . I had a bag that was a pound over . It was 51 pounds . I thought they were going to call the police . Take a pound on the back . Take a pound on the back . What do you want me to cut a pair of underwear in half ? Here s a sock . Leave me alone . Now they give you the full body scan some places . And I don t need that . I believe you can do it psychologically . I believe if someone has something in their ass , you can just ask them . And they won t be able to lie . You don t know if they re lying . Because you ask them out of the blue . So I m going to Las Vegas today . I love Vegas . What did I say last time ? What shows did we say ? Is there something in your ass ? A sock . They wouldn t let me pack it . So last year I flew all over Canada . Actually we drove a lot of it too , which I enjoyed . We drove to Princeton with Island . You want to know what Princeton with Island is ? It s at the end . Drive until you re done . And you ll see a bridge . Go over the bridge . And they re right there . And we had a thousand people on Sunday and Monday . And it was so touching . I m thinking , this is like everybody . And they couldn t have been nicer people . It s not a big town . There s like 12 stores on the main drag . It s a beautiful place to go . If you want to get away and quiet , it s a beach community . And there were 10 and of green gables gift shops . The end of green gables is early 1900s . It s a book , young ladies would read . </s> <s> I guess it s a nice thing when you read it growing up . But 10 and of green gables gift shops . And half of them are in a green gables gift shops . And half of them are candy stores . You know , because you can t make money just off of the end of green gables . The franchise isn t as big as it used to be . So they have these older ladies dressed from the early 1900s in jumpers , like 12 year old girls . And they re all walking towards you with candy samples . And it gets creepy . It s like kind of like the thriller video , you know ? And . . . What ? What ? What ? What ? But I highly recommend it as a place to go and meet nice people . I was in Ottawa and they asked me if I d skate it . And I said , oh yes , I am a skater . I competed in my younger days . I was shot in sassy , the thorddarth in a hammer . People skate there . They skate all day . They skate so long they have snack stands on the ice . And on these snack stands , they sell these things called beaver tails . And they re giant , fried dough . And they cover it in hot fudge in M Ms . And I wanted one . They make you skate to it . And I m standing at the edge of the ice like the kid from up . I waited three days . They said , no , you have to skate it s tradition . I waited three days . Three days and I couldn t take it anymore . So I put skates on . And they pushed me . And I skated . And I didn t do one block around or one surround . I went right to the fried dough stand . I didn t want to mess around . And I was going to make it to the fried dough . There was a family in the way . My mom and dad and two little kids . He shouldn t have been in the way of the fried dough . They turned around and they saw me . You know what I saw in their eyes ? They saw hope . You know like , oh , he ll stop . I couldn t and I didn t . And they went down like a set of bowling pins . But I bought them all fried dough while the paramedics looked them over . So it worked out pretty good . Ice skating is now on my list of things in life I never care if I do again . It s like an anti bucket list . It rhymes with bucket . I can tell you that much . Hiking . If I m not ice skating , I m hiking . What do I think of hiking ? You hike down a mountain . You hike down a ravine . Harbours stories start with , well , we were hiking . And you ended up in North Korea , didn t you ? Why were you hiking ? Because people do this in LA all the time . </s> <s> Oh , we re sick of the city . We re hiking . Do you know how to hike ? Well , no , but we have new boots . I m tired of anybody to get new boots in a compass thinking they re a hiker . Happens every year , doesn t it ? Two people go out , new boots compass . And they get lost . Then they have to hit 100 people out to find them . Then 10 of those poor bastards get lost . They ve got to send a thousand poor bastards out to get down . Three sewn . 10 , 000 people are looking for two assholes with new boots in a compass . And they re going to be a hiker . And they re going to be a hiker . And they re going to be a hiker . Great . Now my director is going , okay , well , we can beat that . That s okay . Even the food that s for hiking . Oh , they have those power . It s not like protein bars . They re not good . And I m chewing on them . And my brain is going , why are you eating this ? They have to make it honest . They have to call it like an eat this or die ball . I went hiking once and I would have killed for a roasted eggplant panini . I put them . Oh , I got one of my crazy friends to help not . She goes , I made my own trail mix . Trail mix . It has trail on the knee . It tastes like trail . I had this . I was sure I d been into a twig . I ll tell you what they do . They put M M s in there to fool you . That s so you re about to spit it out . You go , oh , twig . Oh , no , M M . No , twig . M M . Now that s a twig . M M . I make my own trail mix now . It s a one pound bag of M M . And everybody wants to try one . I went on a little vacation to St . Martin . It s a beautiful island . It s half French , half Dutch , magnificent beaches . A running theme in my life is the airlines losing my luggage . Well , they managed to do it once again . Now they re on water big and talls . I m going to say , Martin . So I bought an extra line shirt at the gift shop . That worked out okay . It went up to about here . And it was so hot I had jeans on . And I couldn t take it anymore after the second day . I had jeans off . And I cut them too short . Sorry I have to be in the front row for this , friends . Now I look like a hooker . And I m not talking about a high end escort . I mean a hoe . Like an HBO documentary . He walks the streets of St . Martin . There was a group of Japanese tourists that saw me . I always fascinated Japanese tourists . They saw me . They get out the cameras right away . Look , look , look , look , look . </s> <s> Ha , coming to a dress like a hooker . Do you know you can see your berry ? You can see his berry . His 20 . Let me rub your berry . I rub his berry . Now they had this fun little water thing . I had long put on my name , Nailist . Water skiing and parasailing . But they had this thing called a banana boat . It s a giant inflatable banana . It s fun but it s unstable . Like most of the people in my life . It s pulled by a motorboat . Now they had two bananas going out at once . Very popular ride . So I look like a hooker . No use being on land . Now I go in the giant banana . Now I m on a French beach . And they re going crazy . They think it s kind of a circus , a lay thing . And I don t blame them . It s a big guy dressed like a hooker . I m a giant banana . Mid downs in the chair . Shuck , do some of that . I get on the banana . And I was having fun . But the boat . The boat took a hard left . I flew off to banana . Into the other banana . And I look over . And it s that poor family from Ottawa . And now they re mad . They don t even have fried dough here . Why are you being so mean ? Two summers ago I had the pleasure of performing at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland . And I thought , what a huge blessing this is . To work in Scotland . I started stand up 25 years ago in Boston , Massachusetts . And it has been a wonderful journey . I ve been to Canada and I thought Scotland just another blessing that this occupation has given me . But everything great in my life has a catch to it . My manager has been my manager for 20 years . He s my best friend . He s one of the smartest people I know , but not this time . He forgot to read the contract . I m going to work 26 out of 27 nights in Scotland . That s too many for me . Remember , I m used to being in places between two and six days . After the third week in Scotland , my brain is screaming at me . Why did you move to Scotland ? 26 out of 27 nights . It rained every day . It was the worst rain since the time of William Wallace . No one has brave hearts . Every man dies . But not every man has an umbrella . The Scottish dialect . I think I have a pretty good ear for dialects . It s very thick when they ve been drinking , which is quite a bit . We don t want to go now . Add it to a bullet . You got it , pal . But every day , think about it . Every day from month , I would wake up . It would be raining , and I would be in Scotland . It s like the movie Groundhogs Day . I m calling up old girlfriends apologizing . </s> <s> Take that curse off of me . Now , that being said , if you re going just for the Edinburgh Festival , go . Just don t go 26 out of 27 nights . They rented me an apartment . And the apartment had a futon bed . You know what a futon bed is ? It s a little more comfortable than a yoga mat . That s all it is . There ain t much to it . Some of you have futon beds . And I actually like futon beds because they re honest . They have FU rate in the name . So , there s somebody called you and go , we re coming to visit . It s going to be taste of Chicago . We re going to come to visit . Sure , you can sleep on the futon . You know if you have a futon for your guest , they won t be staying long . After the third day , I had sciatica . I was crippled . And they made you walk . They didn t pick you up . It wasn t in the contract . And I said , well , where is the venue ? They said , well , you can see it from here . Then you can walk it from here . It wasn t a walk . It was more of a hike . I don t know how much I m adults . I don t know . I don t know . Don t look at me . I used to be a comedian . Monster . He was like , hey . He was like , what s he doing ? What s the big happen now , he s lonely . Who s a fucking guy ? He s dead . Leave me alone . What happens ? I like the load stuff up at a sub shop here . Now , can I have tomato ? I ll pay extra . They think , oh , he s a big guy . He can t jump over the counter . Well , they re wrong . I ll be over that counter before they can look up . Ah ! Here I am . Put tomato on there . Oh , my God . Black olives on a sandwich . How much a black olives ? You have to pretend to sprinkle them like fairy dust . Open your hand , Harry Potter . They gave me a fried Snickers bar . You know , how was that ? Oh , it was peaceful , and I walked towards a bright light . After the third day of eating in pubs , I was going , can I just get in the rugula salad ? There was a Chinese buffet in Scotland . Now , listen . I don t go to buffet as much anymore . The health reasons and restraining orders . But I feel I was singled out a number of times , but I m not going to fight it . I know when I m wrong . And I started comedy in Massachusetts , and I put a few guys out of business , well , me and a few friends . </s> <s> What if one Chinese buffet owner from where I started comedy moved to Edinburgh ? There s a lot of bad memories , and he rebuilt his life in his business . And then I walked into his buffet 20 years later . Father , the forbidden one has returned . You think we forget about you son of a bitch ? We still have your bitch up . You ll go now again . And it squeezed that in . See , I grew up in a predominantly Irish and Italian community . And my father was a bartender at the hour . And I was a bartender at the Irish American . And that s my first life to learn to like dialects . Because he had friends from Ireland , and I get to listen to them , and they tell me all wonderful stories about growing up in Ireland . It was quite fascinating . And you know what ? Honesty is part of their culture . And they said , you re a good boy , but you re a fashionist kid . I don t want to frighten you , but if you re too farpey , you re going to have a . . . Actually , my dad s friend from Ireland gave me the best diet advice they ever had . I m going to give you a diet . It s going to work for your whole life . And it is . You know , because I ve been up and I ve been down , and I feel pretty good now . And he said , this is the only thing that s ever worked . Can I write it down ? It s a good diet . Stop your eating ! If you see it , and it looks all sweet and tasty , well then keep walking . Because you re a fashionist bike . That would make a good neutral system commercial . I m Tommy Sullivan for Nutra Cister . Send in 49 . 95 , where send you big bucks on nothing . Now go out and take a walk . The National Discipline Scotland is called Haggis . I don t like to eat anything that runs with Haggis . Haggis is sheep intestines with oats and spices . Mmm . They ask you every day . One of the many things I loved about Scottish people are that they re fiercely proud and patriotic . And they ask you every day , have your hot Haggis yet ? Oh Haggis is beautiful ! Go and get yourself a prop on Haggis ! I waited . I waited for three weeks . I waited till my manager came . The gentleman that booked me 26 out of 27 nights . I said , where should we eat ? I said we re having Haggis . Sit out ! Now Haggis comes with a whiskey gravy . That helped . It didn t have whiskey in it like . . . Is there whiskey in here ? It had whiskey in it like , did I call you last night ? I am not drunk ! I am having Haggis ! </s>"

        "transcript": "<s> What let s crack on shall we ? I could even you well . Yes ! Fantastic . I ve been described as the hardest working man in comedy . Not that impressive , is it ? The hardest working man in comedy . That s like being the best looking guy in the Burns unit . No offense to any Burns victims we go in . Are there any in if there s one that ll be fucking loads ? They tend to stick together . And we re off . Oh . Someone came up to me outside of it and went , I thought you d be younger . I said , I was . I m 40 years of age , but girls still check me out . I wouldn t mind if they re so bloody obvious about it , pointing and whispering . Stranger danger . Every night after the show I have attracted women banging on my dresser room door and sometimes I ll let them out . I don t know . Are there only comedy groupies in here this evening ? Any gang hangs , any chuckle fuckers ? The only reason I ask is if any girls come up to me after the show looking for sex , I m going to have to disappoint you . I mean , we can have sex . Just it will be quite disappointing . I wouldn t like to hear you be like throwing a sausage up an alleyway . Four information and some of you wanted , okay ? I m a stand up comedian , a TV host , an actor and a writer . People ask me , what s your secret ? I m the M4 rapist . It s a joke . I ve never been wrongly accused of rape . We all like a laugh , yes ? Yes . That s the one thing we ve all got in common in this room . We all like a laugh . It s a very British thing , I think , to come out of an evening with the express intention of just having a laugh . Here s a great fact about this country . The average person in Great Britain laughs out loud ten times a day . Not everyone , obviously . If you work in a hospice or with learning disabled adults , it could be ten times that . That s guys the limit . That s my laugh , which is . . . Someone said my laugh was weird . My laugh isn t weird , it s wrong . Because you re meant to laugh on an outbreak . You re meant to laugh on a ha ha . I laugh on an outbreak . It s just , ah ha ha ha . Sounds like a goose being interfered with . Someone asked me the other day , is it fake ? Why would you fake that ? Ha ha ha ha ha . They say that laughter is the best medicine . So maybe , just maybe , if we all keep laughing at people in wheelchairs . . . I m a dreamer , what can I tell you ? I was at a show recently , I don t know if anyone s had this experience . </s> <s> I was at a show watching a band and standing just under the fire at scape , watching a band play , pint on , with a mate , relaxing . A lady from the venue came up to us . In the little waistcoat and the little name badge came up . Excuse me , I m going to have to move . Because if there s a fire , you re blocking the exit . I said , I tell you what , love , if there s a fire , I ll move . K ring tart . What did she think I was going to do in the event of a fire ? Just stand there going , nobody move . Why is everything gone orangey and hot ? I don t like it . Oh , mobile phones off . I should have said that at the top of the show . Mobile phones off . It s occurred to see to the other patrons in the auditorium . I say mobile phones , what I mean , there is phones . No one s brought a landline , are they ? Let s face facts , the landline is dead . When the landline goes in our house , there s panic . Shit the bed , who the fuck is that ? We re both here . A lot of people text whilst driving . I m not excusing it , but we ve all done things . We were regretful , we re drunk . I saw a thing on the news that said that bad drivers are going to get on the spot 100 pound fines . I thought it s a bit sexist . Do you understand that ? Yes , you did . Yes , you did . I m not in sexist . How could it be some of my best friends or slags ? If this sexist , you could be the judge on this , sorry for being rude , but do you think chat up lines are sexist ? No , they re not . They re fun , right ? I know they re cheesy , but they re meant to be cheesy , that is their charm . I like that one . Get your coat . It s cold in the boot with my car . I don t know if this ever happened to any of you . I was checking into a hotel recently . It s about one o clock in the morning after a gig up in Manchester . Walked into the reception area and the guy recognized me . I m Mr . Carr . We put you in a disabled room . I said , well , I was in between a normal room and a disabled room , and he said that disabled rooms got a walk in shower . Let s take you to fucking piss , isn t it ? I ve got a question for you , ladies and gentlemen . Does anyone in this room believe in the supernatural ? Ghosts and spirits and the like ? Quite a lot of you . It s actually easy to tell if your house is haunted . It isn t . It s not a grow up . </s> <s> It s as me being cynical , but that s the job being a stand up comedian and I think makes you a bit of a cynic . Has anyone in here actually seen a ghost ? What , come on , what did you see , madam ? Tell us the story . There was no one there . Come on , what did you see ? I m not , I make you nervous . You ve seen the undead . And I make you nervous . Doesn t really show me in a good light . Where were you when you saw the apparition ? You were in a friend s house . Right . Her stepfather was want to me . I think I may have cracked this case already . There s a stepfather involved . Was there ectoplasm ? Go on , why are you upstairs ? You ain t his son s bedroom . Of course you were , love . Go on . He had died . You should have mentioned that sooner . And then you started seeing weird shit . I m loving this . There s a special name for people that have seen ghosts . It s schizophrenic . All the best with your future . Quite an index story . I ll leave it at that stepfather . Did something terrible . I knew he coded that memory . Of course , not all fat people are jolly . Some of them are women . They shouldn t be mean fat girls got feelings . Mainly that , hungry . It s only a joke , isn t it ? It s only a bit of fun . I told you the other night that girl got up and walked out . Well , whottled out . I presume a fendid possibly just peckish . Whenever I m in the changing rooms at the gym , I m always embarrassed by the fact my penis is so much bigger than everyone else s . But then inferno is erect . I m the only one who s been there . Islamic fundamentalist sex dolls . Do they blow themselves up ? In Palestinian past inconsistent . Do they just put Israel ? My joke is only there to test where the guardian readers are sitting . No further questions back to the knobgags . I do talk about sex a lot in my show . I talk about sex all the time on stage . A friend called me on it recently . He came to see the gig and he went , you talk about sex all the time . Are you obsessed ? I said , well , I m not obsessed . But sex is the great universal topic for comedy . It s still quite taboo to talk about it openly in public . Everyone s interested . Everyone cranes forward . And there s a lot of tension around sex . And where you find that kind of tension , that s also a great place to find laughter . So sex is a great topic for comedy . But it s difficult to stand in front of you good people and talk about sex without sounding crude . So to try and mitigate that , to try and alleviate that , this evening , if I refer to a vagina at any point , I ll be calling it a twinkle cave . </s> <s> So there I was , licking out a twinkle cave . While she deep throated my tummy banana . It s nice to be nice , isn t it ? I saw a woman wearing a top . It said , super dry on the front . I said , if you thought about lubricants or HRT , maybe a little bit of a Aussie charm . Are you familiar with the term Aussie charm ? Just means . . . Australian charm , you re welcome . Very pleasing look from the ladies of London , as if to say , well , I didn t know that had a name , but yes , that does happen . My girlfriend bought a T shirt for 80 . That s a ridiculous amount of spend under T shirt , am I right ? It s a DNG on the front , I suppose fair enough . One of her tits is bigger than the other . I thought my girlfriend was a slag when she told me I was her 32nd lover and then I realised she was talking about time . There was a minimum comprehension level you may be asked to leave . My ideal woman would be a single mum , once I d finished with her . She d joke , I d pay for the abortion . I got you again , I fucking wouldn t . Let s talk about something a little bit more serious . It can t be slapstick abortion stuff . My first wife was from Thailand . We don t , because you ll feel bad . It s actually quite a sad story . My first wife was from Thailand and she died of testicular cancer . Probably the best way to describe it is a twinkle cave was an outy . I saw a transvestite in a mini skirt . I thought , that shows a lot of balls . Let s hear from all the heterosexual men in the room . Give us a shout out to heterosexual men . I m guessing from that expression . I can t remember which one heterosexual is . I m not taking a chance , maybe this is how they recruit them . The most annoying thing my sister does is that show chatty man . That s a most annoying heckle that I get at gigs . I like him when people join in . I like a bit of a heckle and fun . But the most annoying one I get is when I ve set up a joke . Just about to do the punch line and someone goes , invariably it s the same thing . So it s , where s Ireland ? Where s Ireland ? It s not my like , bet and what ? It s just a bit annoying . Where s Ireland ? He s in your house fucking your dad . I think we all knew , including him . I think we all knew that was a trap . I could feel you as one going hold , hold , hold . And then one brave soul over there said no . Now I m taking one for the team . Or rather your dad is . Of course , not all gay people are happy , camp and fun . Some of them are lesbians . If you re a lesbian and you didn t find that funny , you re surprising no one . Are there any lesbians in ? </s> <s> No , my gay dad is pretty much honed in on this . This pair down the , hello , how are you two ? You re right . Are you , I presume you re a couple ? Married . You re married . Congratulations . Fabulous , how long you ll be married ? Since October . Since October , my god , it s new and fresh . Have you even finished consummating the relationship ? You don t know when you finish , do you ? That s one of the problems . With your lifestyle choice . We ll just put that on hold . We ll be back in a minute . What s so you married , you re committed to each other ? Well , it s maybe a crazy question to ask you , because you re in this long term relationship and you love each other . But what would it take to get you back on solids ? She s a definite no in your own maybe . Okay , go . Oh , I love my job . I tell you what , I m going to do a test and see whether we ve got any other sisters in the room . If there s any other sisters , like Amalese , I ve got the haircut . Come on . I look a bit like K . D . Lang , I could get away with it . The only test , the heterosexuality of the other ladies in the room . Just a simple question to test this . Ladies , have you read 50 Shades of Grey ? You ve all read that , but you love that book . I would describe 50 Shades of Grey as the ultimate flick book . It was the best selling book last year . What s the world coming to ? It was the best selling book last year . I can prove it . Last year , wetest on record . I think it s a very interesting book , because although it s not a great piece of literature , it s more gusset typing . It s interesting because it s pornography for ladies . That s what it is , right ? And men , that book is in our houses , isn t it ? 50 Shades of Grey is in our house , and we ve not even picked it up . We re not looking at your pornography ladies . We re not interested in your kind of pornography . We re very happy with the service broadband is providing . Ladies consume pornography in a very different way to men . The genders are very different in our consumption and pornography . Here s a fact gentleman that will blow your minds about women s consumption of pornography . Women watch porn films to the end . You know why ? To see if they get married . Well , it s probably a good time as only to talk about how political correctness works in stand up comedy . Because some people think it s a free fraud . You can say whatever you want on stage because a freedom of speech . That is not the case . There are rules and regulations that govern what I do . Basically , how political correctness works in stand up comedy is . </s> <s> If you re directly affected by something or involved in something , you get a free pass . You re allowed to joke about that thing . So , for example , homosexual people can joke about being gay . Disabled people can joke about disability . Black or Asian people can joke about race . Those are the rules . So , these two pedophiles walk into a park . Child abuse , there s a touchy subject . I saw a headline in the paper that said , please smash pedophile ring . I thought , good , let s see , are they f ing like it ? Are we only teachers in this evening ? Is the show only teachers ? Oh , loads of teachers in . You were bloody hard on your teachers . Half the year , five hours a day . I m not knocking it . I could never do what you people do for a living . Not because it s difficult , I wouldn t pass a CRB check . I ve actually got a bit of a soft spot for teachers . I used to go out with a teacher and she was lovely . But if everyone had sex , she was insisted to put my hand up first . That is ruder than it first appears . You re welcome . Have we got any special needs teachers in ? You teach special needs teachers in . You teach special needs teachers in . What s your name , madam ? Daniel , very nice to have you in . All I was going to say about special needs teachers is you are the best and the brightest in my humble opinion , the best and the brightest teachers . Because I can prove it . We all know teachers socially , yes ? Everyone knows teachers . And teachers are always moaning on about oh , I ve got homework to mark this evening . Not you , hey Daniel . You re not grading potato paintings , are you ? F ing . Your evenings are your own , fair play . Is that a little yay ? See the other teachers looking on f ing an eye , I didn t think of that . What , sorry ? You used to teach my school a burn and grammar . Not when I was there , surely . No , unless you moisturise . Where are you from ? You re from Belfast , right ? Don t you run , come here today . Bapum , bapum , bapum , bapum , bapum . I would just say what you said to me back . How come you re teaching over here then ? You and the Winnest Relocations game ? What the f happened ? F ing grass . What do you teach ? What s up yet ? What s up ? English , you can barely f ing pronounce . I did count down recently . The TV show , not Dracula s special needs brother . </s> <s> What for the staff room ? And a cast , when I did count down , I wanted to count down , I got asked . But by every man that I know , everyone asked me , how fit is that Rachel Riley off of count down ? How attractive is she when you meet her ? And it wasn t like a rhetorical question . They wanted me to answer . And I thought well , I should be able to say how attractive a work colleague and a friend is without sounding misogynistic without being sexist , should I ? Let me , you be the judge . Rachel Riley , let me put it this way . I would crawl over broken glass to suck the cock of the last man that f ed her . I don t think that s over state you get . I like to f your brains out , I take ages . Now , I should warn you that we ll be some audience participation this evening , apologies . And the only reason I mention it explicitly is because sometimes when I ask someone a direct question , they get a bit flustered . I think it s because they used to see me on TV , so then when I ask them a direct question , they get a bit , the f is going on . I didn t press the red button , it s gone all f ing interactive . I got a guy wonderfully flustered the other day , front and centre where you re sitting there , and I ve nowhere , I went , you married or single ? You went single ? And the guy next to him went , he isn t . How could you f that up ? There was a lovely little pause , you went , I think I might be single now . I will not , who s seen me lie before , give us a shout ? Well , you ll know every year my friend Chris does illustrations for me . But jokes that I write that I think are a bit ecstatic , that require a visual element to be fully enjoyed . Would you like to see them ? Well , good otherwise , he d be f ing gutted . And we d be happy some quiet time . Which would be sh . Well , I ll show you some . Obviously , we ll kick off with some thoughts and ideas that I ve had recently . Right , so , if you like looking at flowers , but you can t be asked with gardening , simply run down a kid outside your house . Oh ! Can t believe you didn t mean to give it ! On bonfire night , I hope our neighbours keep their pets locked up because there s something about fireworks that makes me really horny . You don t get many homeless gay men , which is a shame because they d be f ing bums . I was outside a nightclub recently , and I discovered that women can be bouncers if you re travelling past enough when you mount the pavement . The thing I worry about when I hear kids in the third world are working 18 hours a day to make my trainers is , why don t they get a chance to finish my f ing laptop ? </s> <s> I was in a hotel having breakfast , and the waiter said to me , he said , you want white or brown toast ? I said , all toast is brown , you re thinking of bread . At any one time , a bowl of nuts on a bar will have 17 different types of urine on them . And that s why they re called peanuts . LAUGHTER Wayne Rooney wears the number 10 shirt , or as he calls it , the stican the circle . All the celebrities get plastic surgery these days . Colleen Rooney s just had some work done on a rar sol . He s at Air Transplant . LAUGHTER My friend , Rickens , football violence and aggressive behaviour are triggered by primitive tribal rivalries , which are projected onto opposing teams and then expressed through exaggerated displays of loyalty . But he s a lying guna twat so we can suck my f ing cock . All that groaning and grunting in women s tennis , it reminds me of sex , in that I m watching a happen on screen whilst masturbating . LAUGHTER To explain spot fixing in cricket , it s what happens when something I don t understand is done by someone I ve never heard of . In the middle of something I couldn t give a f about . Spiders used to give me nightmares , anyone else ? Yes , so why have done this ? I ve stopped eating them just before bedtime . Of course , the worst thing about being bitten by a poisoner spider is that you re probably Australian . Are there any Australians in ? Yes ! Welcome back . I don t like zoos , I prefer to see lions , tigers , elephants and bears in their natural environment . They re circus . Is anyone here afraid of clowns ? You re afraid of clowns , sir ? There s actually a special name for people that are afraid of clowns . Mummy s little benders . This may interest you though , clowns have to register their facial design to make sure the other sex offenders don t use it . Dwarves ! Often get overlooked . I can say that , they look up to me . Can you treat ourselves to another dwarf joke ? Tell you what I know about dwarves . Very little . Come on . Here s a random fact . It s random , but it s true . One in ten British kids is now conceived in an IKEA bed . True , how it works is their parents insert flap into sloppy and then screw until the nuts tighten . In 2009 , Nadia Suleiman of California gave birth to Octoplets , two daughters and six aunts , only her the nickname Octo Mum , although she s also known as Gigantos Snatch . Those babies were walking before she was . I think the men in the room will be able to relate to this . My girlfriend always wants to stay in and watch down to an Abbey . But I want to go out and get a new girlfriend . I thought it d be okay for me to have sex with other women because my girlfriend and I were on a break . But apparently I ruined that weekend at Centre Park . I was going to tell you a story about the poshest place I have ever been . </s> <s> I got invited last year to Clarence House , where Charles and Camilla live in Central London . I ve gotten invited to that . I m involved in this hospice charity , because I m such a fucking terrific guy . Not because I was press ganged into it . No , no , no . Maybe a little . Anyway , I m involved in this thing . So Camilla is the patron of this great charity . So she organised drinks and a concert and dinner in her home to thank the corporate sponsors and to get more people to donate money , raise a bit of money , raise awareness , that sort of thing . In her home , though , she put on this event . So we re all in her front room , literally Charles and Camilla s front room . It s the most all naked , like , high beautiful sort of ceilings and they ve got a telly in the corner , like normal people might have . But every square inch of mantelpiece and shelf and sideboard has got a beautiful object on it , that they ve been given by visiting dignitaries or they ve picked up on their extensive travels of the world . It s a very intimidating space to be in . So we re all standing there having a drink and she s coming around saying hello to everyone and she gets to me and because I m a dick , as I feel , we ve established . She gets to me and goes , oh , how are you involved ? And I went , never mind about that . Have you seen cash in the attic ? Because we re sitting on a gold mine here . And to her credit , it s absolutely true , she went , yes , winked and fucked off . I did another weird royal thing last year . I did the Jubilee . Do you see the Jubilee ? I did a little thing where I had to introduce Grace Jones in a hula hoop . Nice work if you can get it . In order to do that , I had to get past security at Buckingham Palace . Here s what it consisted of . So I met an armed police officer . He s only job is to guard our queen , to make sure that no one steals our queen and uses her head to photocopy it and make their own money and stamps . So I walked up to this armed police officer outside Buckingham Palace . I said , security , he went , yeah . Here s his question . He said , are you in Al Qaeda ? I went , no . As you were . I thought this guy seems fun . So I asked him , I said , does anything funny ever happen when you re rolling with the queen ? He said , yeah , I ll tell you this story . Has to be in confidence though . </s> <s> I said , you can trust me . He is not a good judge a character . I m also in Al Qaeda . No , no . Or am I ? No . So he told me this story . He said , the queen , I thought , how entourage ? She travels with about 15 people . They went up to Glasgow last year . She was opening a drop insent to Fahomla South Colics , of course in Glasgow . Where else would you fucking put it ? It s very much ground zero for homeless alcoholics . It s their biggest export . So the queen s there and she s cutting through the ribbon like a fucking ninja and all the usual stuff out there . There s the mayor , there s the local dignitaries , there s the chairman of the charity the people that work in the local office . And they ve got a couple of the homeless guys , the alcoholic homeless guys , from Glasgow , that the charity has helped in other locations , suited and booted , washed and brushed there to meet the queen so that she could see the people that benefited from her kind works . Lovely . So the queen , as we all know , has only got one bit of schtick , which is the question , what do you do ? That s her only question . She doesn t point like that , that would be mental . But that s her only question , what do you do ? That s all she asks . She said to a Scottish alcoholic homeless man , what do you do ? And he came back rather epically only feel with . . . Same as you , nothing ! Apparently she was fucking terrified . I friend of mine quite recently , a couple of months ago , got proper old school flashed . Guy in a Mac at Darsk in a park , one of those . Sorry , I ve added that . I don t . . . I don t know if you did that . You would though , wouldn t you give it back to Coxlap ? You d probably treat it to the windmill , wouldn t you ? Who you own ? Anyway , she got proper old school flashed and she shouted , rape ! I thought , don t give it my ideas . Don t workshop with your fucking lunatic . Has anyone in here been flashed ? Go on , what happened , Madam Tate ? Is there a funny story or is it distressing ? In a club , someone flashed you in the club . Are you sure you didn t go off with a man in a club ? I was kissing him , I don t . . . I undid his hip and then he flashed me . Tell me the story . Middle of the dance floor and he was throwing some shapes . And one of his was . . . No , I told him that we were lesbians . So to get rid of the guy , your friend told him you were lesbians . </s> <s> That s how these two started , but then . . . They liked it , so they stuck with it . And did that work ? She said we don t like Cox . So sorry , so someone flashed , someone got his cock at . In the middle of the dance floor in a club and you went , oh no , sorry , we re lesbians . You could have just told him to fuck off , you re incredibly polite . I ll make up an excuse so he doesn t feel bad . I don t want the flasher to feel rejected . How nice of you ! Has anyone else been flashed ? You got arrested for flashing . Or don t take it on me . What do you mean you got arrested for flashing ? You re going for a piss ? This sounds like bullshit to me . You re going for a piss . Where were you going for a piss ? Get set the scene for us . I ve never met anyone that s flashed . It s going for a piss in a primary school . Got in a car park , okay . In a car park outside , you re going for a piss . Court short , late at night , fine , okay . I need a piss , so I went up against a tree . You went up against a tree ? Turned out wasn t a tree , was a fat guy ? So you walked up to a tree to take a pee in a car park . This doesn t sound terrible , so far I m on this guy side . Go on . So there was a woman in the trees . There was a woman in the trees . It s something that you ve broken doggy etiquette by kissing on someone . So you went up to take a piss on a tree and there was a woman in the tree . She was walking , okay . And it was outside a police station . Kind of a fucking idiot , are you ? You went for a piss in the police station car park . Why don t you just turn yourself in ? That s a cry for help if ever I heard one . Lock me up before I heard someone . And what did she scream ? Did she come down ? What happened ? She went into the police station and they came out and arrested me for indecent exposure . They came out and arrested you for indecent ? Is it because you re a bit ginger ? Do you think they would have let you off if you hadn t been quiet as . . . I m sorry about these lights as well , we couldn t well be giving you skin cancer . I think I m on your side there . If you re taking a piss , that s not in Disney s exposure , is it ? What do you think ? Can we go on this side ? There s one more . . . no . Stop pissing outside , you crazy fool . But because there was a woman in the other night with a story , she said , oh , I got flashed . </s> <s> And then she told me the story and I wasn t sure . I said , is anyone been flashed ? She went , yeah , I got flashed in Disneyland . I said , I m all ears . She said I was in Disneyland Florida , I was walking in past the hotels in Disneyland and into the park . And I looked up at one of the hotels and the guy was opening his bedroom curtains , flashed me . I said , no , he didn t . You are a peeping Tom . My girlfriend wants a diamond ring and the only reason I know that is , it s pretty much all she fucking talks about . Let s face facts . Anywhere my girlfriend s getting a diamond ring is if the vajazzler slips . I don t really understand the vajazzle . I mean , I know what a vajazzle is . I know , I know what it is . They whip away all the hair from you . Foo foo , and then they de mon ta it . I say , they , I imagine you get some pretty sick and glitter and ever crack yourself . Have a sparkly crack yourself . You re welcome . I just don t know who that s for . I ve never met a man who said to me , oh , I love a joiner . But we should have been more juggie . A few more sparkles wouldn t go amiss . I want a glamour plus a showbiz entrance . Has anyone heard of a jazzle ? She heard . What motif did you go for , Madam ? It s a little bit embarrassed to ask for one . You had a heart because you were embarrassed to ask for . . . Like something spectacular . You were embarrassed to ask for something spectacular . You were on with someone putting glitter on your family , but you weren t . . . I don t know how to ask for anything embarrassing . How adorable . And was it for a special occasion or was it just . . . No , I just thought , why not ? You thought , why not ? Or , apparently , a fucking reason , basic hygiene . Your boyfriend could chip a tooth . And it was definitely a problem of the jazzle , or not a Liverpool of the jazzle , which is just a euphemism for herpes . LAUGHTER Is anyone else coming across the jazzle ? He has ! He has ! Not hers , I hope . What did they have ? I can t remember . It was my stag do . You can t remember . It was your stag do . Oh ! You can t remember anything . Sounds like a Liverpool of the jazzle to me . No , no , I don t know what happened . It s just really itchy . Fucking hell . Obviously , I could never get out of the jazzle because I don t have a VJJ . But I would consider glitter balls . You know , for a special occasion . Oh , speaking of special occasions , there was a couple in a couple of weeks ago , one of my gigs , 35 years married . </s> <s> I got challenged at them , so I thought , well , quite an incredible thing in this day and age . I got a challenge at them . I said , what do you get her for the anniversary ? And he said , do you fat friar ? I said , well , what did she get you ? And he went , chips . LAUGHTER And they seemed thrilled with that arrangement . They got me chatting to people about , why is the worst gift you ve ever got ? Birthday anniversary Christmas Valentine s . Why is the worst piece of shit you ve ever got ? LAUGHTER Oh , we ve had a haircut . Got what ? What was that , so a little bit louder ? Take it to the shop . No , that s fine . So , what s your name ? What , what s your name ? Toby . Toby , do you mind me sharing with the group ? Thank you very much indeed , Toby . That makes it much easier . Because there s a haircut . It s quite a good haircut . It s quite funny , heckle . But we have to do a haircut , now . God . LAUGHTER I would love it if I could just let it go , but I can t . There are rules . But you don t mind me sharing with the group , so it makes it much easier . We can go old school . What , sorry ? Stop stalling . Stop stalling . Don t panic , sir . I ve got this . I ll have to put you on our whole waiting . LAUGHTER No . Toby s mum . . . . . is so fat . She s a fucking disgrace , Toby . Your mum is such a chunky monkey wobble slob . Fatty boom battery , blah ba naught . She s so fucking fat , when she fell down the stairs , I thought he s stenders had finished . Boom , boom , boom , boom , boom , boom , boom , boom , boom , boom , boom . True story . Ahem . You , sir . What did you say ? What was it ? Stop stalling . What , what s your name ? Gary . Are you trying to say Gary ? LAUGHTER Watch me . Gary . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . What the fuck is that ? Well , Gary , if you want my comeback , you ll have to scrape it off your mum s teeth . LAUGHTER APPLAUSE Uh huh . Uh huh . Worst gifts . Worst , what s the worst gift ? What s the rain ? You got a bread maker . Are your husband bought you a bread maker ? What a fucking asshole . No , I just hate the whole concept . Because bread makers , and I mean , I spent like 200 quid on a bread maker . That s convenient , isn t it ? Because you don t live near shops , and bread isn t fucking cheap . Oh , I ll just make my own . That s fine . Because the ingredients cost more than a loaf of bread , but don t worry about it . So what did you get him ? Instead of an engagement ring , you . . . </s> <s> LAUGHTER You ve got a bread maker instead of an engagement ring . LAUGHTER You broke up with him , right ? You ve just divorced him . LAUGHTER Yay ! APPLAUSE Why did you go through with Mary here ? I mean , that must have been fucking awkward in the office . LAUGHTER Look at this . Well , it s a nice one , sparkly . You poor thing . Any other band gifts ? You go and pour water ? A dog , booperscupa . Do you have a dog ? At the time , yes . At the time , yes . What the fuck have you done with your dog , dude ? Why haven t you done ? You don t have him anymore . Oh , Toby s mum , et him . LAUGHTER What the fuck , bitch ? LAUGHTER Sorry , dude . Any other band gifts ? Nothing ! What would you get ? Nothing ! LAUGHTER Jesus , listen to the bitterness there . I think there are worse gifts than nothing . It s a lie like this , like women get bought hoovers by their other half . And it s not just a shit gift , it s a bit of a dig . At least something in the house has got some fucking suction . Oh , you said you wanted a bag and a belt , that s got both . You re welcome . There was a girl in the other day for a 21st birthday from her Nana . Now Nana s a mental anyway . But her Nana bought her gift wrapped , beautifully gift wrapped , an Argos catalog . LAUGHTER With two pound coins other taped to the front . Oh , Pikes . LAUGHTER What , the worst one I think a lot of people don t have secret Santa . Did you do secret Santa at your work ? It s a nightmare , isn t it ? To get something good for under a five or under a tenor , I went out and bought a brawn and a star streamer . She was livid . No , please , in some people . Not like you didn t need it . The best gift is obviously anal sex . Not for a secret Santa thing , that s a fucking disaster . But no , it is , is it better to give them to receive ? And anal sex is the gift that keeps on giving , unless it stops giving in which house it tears . LAUGHTER Not too much . Oh , the worst one I think a lot of people bought gift vouchers . Who hears bought gift vouchers ? What , what are you thinking ? You walked into a shop , when it s , excuse me , I wonder , could you help me ? I ve got some money here , this is accepted everywhere . Could you fix it for me so it just works in this one shop ? For a limited time period , I should explain it to gift and I m a fucking idiot . It s a great feeling when you get a woman you ve been chasing for miles . I ve known thousands of women in the biblical sense and by biblical sense I mean made up women that don t really exist . </s> <s> A lot of people just drift into relationships without really thinking about it . We call those people men . A lot of men say when they first get together with a woman , they can t initially tell if it s the real thing . But I can , because I ve got a special elindicator that sticks up . Come on in , sit down , what s your name , madam ? Alexa . Alexa , and what is it , some sort of stitus , what s the matter ? What d you do for living , Alexa ? Um , lots of things . You do lots of things . Yes , I think I ve seen a part advertising your services . Are you new in town ? Don t let me guess . I m going to spire in presenter . You re an aspiring presenter . Well , I ll say to you , when I say to all aspiring presenters , that s I meet . I ll have an Americano , please . Oh , I fucking love my job . And , Jason , do you remember what you were doing the first time you told a woman that you loved her ? I do , I was lying . Don t give me that look , it worked , I fucked her . We went out for a drink the other night , me and my girlfriend , and we were chatting about what people actually think about when they re having sex . Not a conversation I would recommend . She said to me , she said , what kind of a man fantasises about his partner s friends , whilst he s actually having sex with his partner ? And I said , promise you won t get mad . What do you think is the most important thing in a relationship ? Give us a shout . Sex . Sex . How long have you been together with your one ? Four years . Four years , and sex is still the most important thing . Well , you , sir , are a liar . After two years , I would give you . After two years is fine , but sex is the most important thing . You re ripping each other s clothes off , it s fantastic . After two years , whilst I m coming up on the inside , coming up pretty fast , sky plus . And any other thoughts , most important thing in a relationship ? Trust , not a lady saying trust , any other ? Cricket . Cooking . Cooking s the most important thing . Are you the guy from Quantum Leapers ? You just got here from 1970 . Cooking s the most important thing in a relationship . Have you ever become engaged by awarding someone a breadmaker by the chance ? I don t know the weirdest answer . The weirdest answer I had recently . I said , well , it s the most important thing in a relationship , but I ve never went consent . </s> <s> There was a guy up in Edinburgh . I said , most important thing in a relationship , but he went , me . A terrified looking woman next to him going . Any other thoughts ? Lubricant . Well , if you run out , any other ? Outlaw racket . What s hurry ? Punch your racket . A puncture repair kit . Funny , I like that . I think you deserve more . Come on . Any other ? What s hurry ? Love . Grow up . Who were you in a relationship with ? You re my little pony . Ha ha ha . Any other thoughts , most important thing ? Laughter . Laughter . Well , I don t know about that . I do think a sense of humour is what I look for in a woman . If a woman can see the funny side of life , she s much less likely to press charges . I think trust is the most important thing in a relationship , because if you re with a woman and you don t 100 trust her , how do you know she s not going to tell your wife ? I do love it when a woman says those magic words that mean she s definitely up for sex that night . This drink tastes funny . I m joking , you can t taste it . I m not a prude . You d agree with that , wouldn t you ? I m not prude ish . Here s the thing . I don t like swearing during sex . Who wants to hear that kind of language , especially from a child ? Oh , the look you gave me there . You prefer a sweary kid , fair enough . I had a thing happen to me recently , a little bit embarrassing . I got caught . I didn t think this could happen when you were a grown up . I got caught masturbating . Bolly my girlfriend . What do you say ? Sorry , I woke you . You ve got sleep in your eye . I don t know about you , but I don t like celebrities that are only famous because of who their parents are , like Callum Best and Peaches Geldoff and Jesus . I heard a reporter on Sky News say at least one person killed in suicide bomb attack . Yeah , obviously . That is the bare minimum you need to qualify . It was something about burning a copy of the Quran in Afghanistan . I was watching it thinking I would never burn a copy of the Quran because I ve got a Kindle . Just deleted , don t fuck about . I m not worried about Islamic suicide bombers . They can only do it once . A Hindu suicide bomber , that is more of a threat . Because of the reincarnation . Oh , no , it was going on . I was going to talk to you about terrorist threat levels in this country because our government picked the weirdest words for our terrorist threat levels . </s> <s> You know , sometimes they announce them at the end of the news , the weather , the pollen count , and then the terrorist threat level for no reason at all . And it s words that I don t understand . So at the moment , the terrorist threat level in this country is substantial . Ask the police officer , what am I meant to do with substantial ? He said , watch yourself . I said , well , I m not involved . Do you want the highest terrorist threat level is ? How s this for a creepy word ? Imminent . The fuck am I meant to do with imminent ? I imagine , clench . I mean , I ve never been near a bomb when it s gone off by a imagine . Now , take the edge off , wouldn t it ? And we all know that isn t the highest terrorist threat level . The highest terrorist threat level , as we all know is , I don t care if this does , that racist , I m getting off the bus . That is a massive rucksack , and he doesn t need to be saying his prayers out loud . I m fucking doing one . Where middle class guilt is overtaken by fear , you know you re in trouble . Of course , with these jokes , I can face the wrath of Islam , which I ve always thought sounds like a shit pub . Where we going , wrath of Islam , off a fuck site . There s no booze , there s no fruit machine , there s no pork scratchings . Yeah , but women can get stoned . Sometimes doing this job , you feel very exposed . Not when I m doing jokes , but when I m doing an observational bit of comedy , you feel like if no one can relate to this , I m going to feel a fool . So , being a share with me if you ve had a similar experience , it s always embarrassing when you get an erection during a prostate exam . And they realise , hang on , you re not a real doctor . Jokes on her , she hasn t even got a prostate . Have we got any teenage girls in ? Give us a shout out to your teenage girls ? I m sorry , I realise that is a creepy question . The reason I ask , I read a thing recently , it said that 90 of teenage girls are sexually active . Bullshit . A lot of them just lie there . I m a flui , and you re not my real dad ? I have to get asked by young guys , young men after the show often ask me , can you laugh a woman into bed ? The short answer , yes . Obviously , she s too young for you if you haven t to say pick a boo , but yeah . You can laugh a woman into bed . The tough bit comes 20 minutes later when you re trying to laugh her into a taxi home . I don t want to make a big deal of this , but I recently adopted a new born African child . It was just 7 , plus postage and packing . That s how they get you . If only they put holes in that box . And that is the joke interestingly that Richard Curtis said was a bit much for the comic relief gig . </s> <s> Have you all been on that first foreign holiday abroad ? Like the first foreign holiday you went on without your parents ? Everyone been on that holiday ? Has anyone not been on that holiday yet ? Oh , quite a few of you . You ve got a lot to look forward to . It s an amazing trip . It tends to be all the guys go away together , all the girls go away together , somewhere hot in Europe that s cheap that year . We went away five of us , the went all the way through school together . We just got a rid of results . One away for two weeks in Falleraki . It was awesome . Sun , sea , sex and sand , that s what we re looking for . That s what we found . It was an amazing life affirming wonderful holiday . In those two weeks , I had sex with 12 different people . I m not bragging . I was gang raped . Still , I didn t let it s former trip . If there s a fight , I let my fist do the talking . Please don t hurt me . I went to a fairly posh single sex school , but I never really fitted in . I think it s partly because I m male . Partly because it was 35 when they caught me . My granddad , I was used to insist on standing up whenever a woman entered the room , which is ultimately what led to him to be . Ultimately , what led to him losing his disability living allowance . I was up in North London , I saw a guy in the high street with a guy dog and a white stick . I went up to him , I went , you must be blind . He said , tell me something I don t know . I said , there s a tree over there . I m gonna be a dick about it . You never forget your first , especially if they ve got an unusual name . Ar kayla . There s something I don t understand about a woman s jeep spot . I can t quite put my finger on it . I can drive a woman . . . Well done . That s it , home there , has it ? Touched a nerve , so to speak . No very apt . I can drive a woman wild with my tongue . Would you like me to demonstrate ? Pay attention to all the actions happening here , young man . Drive a woman wild with your tongue . Have you palm weight ? A and all sex is overrated , it s fucking shit . Can I have it like buggery ? I tried it with my girlfriend , she was bored to tears . Everyone was gonna get it , got it ? Let s move along . We ve been together now for 12 years , my girlfriend . So to keep things fresh in the bedroom , we do a little bit of role play . She pretends to be a nurse , and I pretend I m still attracted to her . </s> <s> I must have invited the rumours , isn t it ? There s people who thought I was funny , and then there are unattractive women . Some girls like to have the lights off for sex to happen . They re like , all the lights to be out before they have sex . And they ve got a name , they re called fuckily monitors . I ve never had a complaint about that joke . I ve never had a woman come up to me after the show , gone , excuse me . I m a fuckily monitor . How do you think I feel ? Hungry ? Are their couples in give a show ? I ve got a theory about sex in long term relationships . So the received wisdom is , it s men that instigate sex within a long term relationship . It s the man that says , should we go upstairs , for a bit of slap and tickle , better house your father , a bit of sticky belly . Whatever you call it in your houses . But it s the man that asks . I think that is misogynistic bullshit . That s like saying the man s got the sex drive , and the woman is just passive . I reckon it s about 50 50 in most relationships . The reason you don t notice when women ask for sex is because when women ask for sex , it happens . We ve got the expression getting lucky because we re rolling the dice , ladies . If your woman says to you , join up , says , and fuck . Yep . It doesn t matter what else is going on . You could be full of flu . You could have just received devastating news . You could have just been shot in the leg by her . Join up , says , and fuck . Yes , I do . But sometimes , gentlemen , you ll know this . Sometimes , in a long term relationship , you ll suggest becoming amorous with your partner . You ll suggest having sex , and you ll say no . And then she will give you some kind of curial , strange reason as to why sex could not occur at that moment in time . And you would like to respond . You d like to argue back , but you can t think of anything , because you can t think at all , because all the blood is somewhere else . So I thought , well , why don t we take advantage of the situation we find ourselves in ? Why don t we workshop it ? What reasons have you heard , gentlemen , not to have sex and will come up with a response ? What have you heard ? Headache . Tired . Okay , let s deal with those in order . Headache . Easy . The former says , look , I ve got a headache . Just say , I m going to be right at the other end . I could not be further away from that problem . Also , I m going to fuck you . We re not doing seducu . </s> <s> You re not going to need your wits about me . Tired . Tired is like the modern equivalent of headache . And I think genuinely , for women , since you re like , I can t have sex and tired . What you ve got to do , you ve got to listen , obviously . You ve got to acknowledge . It s not enough just to listen . She s got to know that you ve heard . And then , make a suggestion . That s my advice anyway . Don t demand anything for a woman . Make a suggestion . So , so if a woman said , I can t have sex and tired . I d say , of course you re tired . I hear you . You ve got the kids . You ve got the house . You ve got work . You must be exhausted . So why don t you ? And it s just a suggestion . But why don t you ? You normally do and just fucking lie there . You lazy fucking cow . Any other excuses for not having . . . . . . preglent . He s too young . It s a long term relationship you re in , right ? She s like , I really can t have sex with you . I m too young . Yeah . And what was that one ? Preglent . Are you trying to nudge it towards a freeway ? Is that bad , clearly , yes ? It s bad . I don t know how long anyone but we ve got a pirate in the house . Heist the main sail . He s dead . He s dead . And yet you re still hearing a voice saying no . That isn t her . That s your conscience , you monster . Do any other excuses for not having sex ? Your cock s too big . Try fucking a grown up . Any other ? Could you just repeat what you said there ? She s on the blob . How nicely put , sir , I think . . . . . . I think a lesser man might have said menstruation . Or her time of the month or maybe . . . . . . period . Even Arsenal are playing at home . She has the red devil in her belly . A Honda Ricks . But you won t be with a much more gen teal . What the blob ? So the blob and she . I think in all seriousness , if a woman says like I can t have sex , I ve got my period . I would say , well , your arse isn t bleeding , is it ? Yet . Give me a moment to work my match , you . The best one I heard recently , someone said a very nice gig in Cambridge . </s> <s> I said , any reasons for not having sex with an long term relationship that you ve heard from woman ? A one on one morning fanny . She said , morning fanny . I heard you . I don t know what that is . It s morning fanny . She said , you know morning breath . It s that downstairs . Oh , my God . Morning fanny , you know . I m telling you these rather baudi jokes , but I m actually quite a sensitive kind of guy . I m quite a mentor , sexual . I remember the first time I got together with my girlfriend 12 years ago now . At first , we had sex . First , we hooked up . I cried . I don t know whether it was the physical act or the emotion of it or the pepper spray , but I teared up . People do weird shit , sexually . Shall we talk about some of the weird shit people do ? Joronto files , if you re not familiar with the term , Joronto files are people that find the very elderly sexually attractive . I don t know , bit of a mouth , or , isn t it , Joronto file ? I prefer to call them OAP dos . I like a bit of granny fanny . Where s the harm ? 50 shades of grey , very different thing for them . Years ago , this woman introduced handcuffs into our sexual relationship when she called the police . I said , I ll come quietly . If you strangle yourself during sex , it s called auto erotic expixiation . If you do it to someone else , it s called a serious sexual assault . My bad . I fluff , do you know what a fluffie is ? A fluffie is when you re having sex with a woman , and , sorry , scratch that , not when you re having sex with a woman , when you re making love to a lady . And as you make love to that beautiful lady , a fluffie is when she faults on your balls . Couple of things , couple of quick things . Firstly , really , that s happening enough that we need a special term for that . And secondly , how do you ask for that ? Not that I would want that to happen , but when you find out that s your thing , how do you ask for a tap ? Because presumably , no one asked for that at the first time it happened . That was a happy accident . He was working away and one slipped down . And he thought , that s not an unpleasant sensation . But then it s very difficult to ask for that to happen again . How do you think it would have come across as Mr . Darcy , the King of Romance , when saying to the woman in your life , would you mind later on , when we make love , farting on my balls ? It s much easier to take a route for Indian food and hope for the best . Has anyone in here ever walked in on people having sex ? What did you walk in on , sir ? Your parents ? What kind of special hug was Mummy doing with daddy ? What did you actually see when you walked in ? </s> <s> What was your dad up to ? I mean , his balls , presumably , but . . . Did you get an eye fault ? Sorry , obviously not like that . That d be awful . You d have to think that was pre meditated . If you walked in , he was , oh , this is going to be brilliant . You saw your parents , because I presume you followed the classic etiquette of walking in on people having sex , which you walk in , I see , off . And you re okay , straight to therapy . Has anyone else walked in on people having sex ? Yeah . Go on , what you re walking on , sir ? I don t know why that s bad . I get it so much worse . Because if it was your son , I think we would all go , yeah , go on , son . Go on , my son . But with your daughter , you can t walk in a go on love . Or you ll like your fucking love in that . Here s my little girl . I mean , hopefully it was a guy you were approved of . Was it a guy you were approved of ? He s saying next to you . I hope you obeyed the etiquette . You walk in , you walk out straight away . There s certain things that people do sexually , though , that could not be a response . Are we all familiar with the rusty trombone ? This is sexual practice whereby a lady is kissing a guy s ass . I don t mean that metaphorically . I mean that in a far more literal and rimmie type sense . And as that s going on , she s also administering a handjob . So there s this movement and the per slips . When you can see how they got to rusty trombone , I ve got no problem with the name per sell . My question is if you re walking on people doing that , what would your response be ? Like , you sure ? Got a question for the ladies . All women I know have got a very clear line . On one side of the line , things they re happy , confident , comfortable , and enjoy doing sexually with a loving partner on the other side of the line . Things that you can t do , they re not going to be a problem . They re not going to be a problem . They re not going to be a problem . They re not going to be a problem . They re not going to be a problem . These are the things that men that are expenditure is all they re affbeh .

Oh I m having a shit . I ve had loads of shit . It s pretty boring What about This whole area is free At what point in the relationship did he ask for that the ends Not a bad way to end a relationship things aren t going well you re not getting on I ll see if she ll suck me off while I m having a shit Is this he if she says yes , I think she loves you And yet any other any other weirdness the reason I ve asked that question a few times now is because it s my favorite bit of the show because I know That there are women out there who are currently having pressure applying to their legs By the men in their lives They re a man out there going . I just wanted to fucking try it shut up Oh The weirdest one I heard about recently from an audience member was a Simba have you heard of a Simba ? You know a Simba a Simba is from the Lion King I believe It s when you re with a beautiful lady you re making sweet love to her and you finish on her chest Fine a little bit disrespectful some might think but fine and you take Simba Bringing a little Disney magic to the bedroom I m not sure my girlfriend would appreciate a Simba but I think I think I could just do it on my own . I think the next time I think the next time I m at home and I ve got broadband and a bit of time to myself . I think I might try and finish there Simba I Got a tip for the ladies or if you like I could put the whole thing in Does it sure one Do you want to know the secret to the perfect hand job use your mouth ? </s> <s> I left my last girlfriend because she got really fat .

I don t have kids , but if I had kids , I think I would have them adopted People criticize Madonna , but the kids she adopted fair trade Are we going to do that and give a shout all the dads ? Did you cry at the birth of your first child ? Oh very few of you are knitting it . A lot of guys are embarrassed by the fact they cry to the birth of their first child I think it s because they don t quite know why they cry . There s different theories Some people think it s the biological bond with the child that you meet for the first time But that can t be it you re only mean it for the first time It s not like the mother that s been carrying inside of that s more of a biological thing with the guy . No Some people think men cry at the birth of their first child because the gift that s been bestowed on them by the woman in their life That would make them tear up I Think the real reason most men cry at the birth of their first child is because they see with a lot of shit . </s> <s> It s done to the misses Oh , no Now she s got a vaginus If my grandmother knew how much I spent on her funeral she would be spinning in her ditch When I was a kid I didn t want to imagine my parents having sex I d watch them from the wardrobe Can closet gay agro phobics ever come out ? How can you possibly explain the concept of death to a young child ? Well , you need a hammer and a hamster He s not gone to live on a farm as he s all over the fucking job You know we feel so much better when you have a wink with a dead arm , but apparently I ruin that funeral I Remember in the playground my dad s harder than your dad . It s not really the issue the issue is both our dads have erections in a playground I Researchers have created a contraceptive pill that deactivates sperm before it reaches the womb my girlfriend s got something similar called stomach acid 10 of women have cried in a shop changing room . I guess they won t expect to nissimi there Is an interesting fact the reason Morris dancers wear bells is so blind people know their cunts too They say a problem shared is a problem halved didn t really work with AIDS did it ? You know you can get AIDS from a toilet seat But only if you sit down before the last guys got up My girlfriend asked me recently she said what s happened to your sex drive ? I said I burnt it and smashed it with a hammer I was worried the police were gonna get older Humans and dolphins are the only mammals that have sex for pleasure that dog will do it for a biscuit Oh If you suffocate in a bag for life You be fucking living wouldn t you ? Yeah , I only had kill you and I recently read great expectations and it wasn t as good as I thought was gonna be I can do a brilliant Michael Jackson impersonation would you would you like to see it ? I just need a young volunteer that can keep a secret You know those human statues you get in the middle of town You know the ones painted silver gold stand stock still and then to give them like 50 people in your walk past they move their hand like a fraction Actually works out cheaper if you re gonna go past them every day just to buy a taser I had a thing happen in the high street the other day you know the charity muggers You know the ones with the clipboard and the optimism in the in the high street I dodged two of the cunts and the third one got me with why considered to be an unfair tactic the backwards walkin talk So I hadn t stopped I hadn t made eye contact and she told me her sad story as she tried it along Backwards and the wording was just perfect for me She said you know how often people die from AIDS . I said I m not an expert , but I m guessing just the ones I So an extraordinary anti AIDS thing recently I was in Johannesburg last year doing some gigs and I saw in Johannesburg This charity had printed a leaflet with everything you need to know about HIV and AIDS because there s a lot of myths about AIDS in South Africa So it print up this leaflet and because they raised more money than they needed they decided to attach a condom to every leaflet Good idea . </s> <s> So they stapled a condom Generally true the Everest of fuck withery It s with an either East South Africans in Well , that s quite a few why it s weird the linguistic differences you notice when you travel like like in this country When you say I m not racist what you tend to mean is I m not a racist in South Africa When someone says I am not a racist They mean they re about to say something fucking racist Is this racist to Chinese people have guess who ? I tried that joke for the first time in a tiny little 50 seater theater above a pub and there was a Chinese lady front and center And she laughed enough that she s not bent forward and it looked like I d gone no Can you really with it ? I like to think I m I like to think of myself as an equal opportunities offender I like to think I offend everyone and therefore no one because it s kind of a blanket bombing approach to offense It s like I m not picking on any group and also I m not really making any points I m I m just trying to make you laugh for a couple of hours . That s my only job in this world I m not trying to make any points or change anyone s mind about anything and the best defense of a joke is always just a joke There s only joking relax just trying to make you giggle When you try and say something that s true earnestly from the heart That s when it can fuck up much more spectacularly in your face I ve got a story about this . Do you want to hear it ? It s a story about PC blowing up in a friend s face So this mate and mine it s quite a long story which is unusual for me But it s a doozy you ll enjoy this mate in mind runs a comedy club . Okay at a university He s in his mid 60s now . It s been running it since the early 80s . It s a legendary club Anyway runs this thing . He s quite a right on kind of guy if there s a petition to sign He s signing it and forwarding the email to me if there s a march to go on . He s on the march very right on political Involved kind of guy anyway , he runs this comedy club . This incident happened about 12 years ago He decided to put on a night of American stand up comedy that happened to be three American stand ups in London the same weekend Okay , so he decided well instead of just booking one of them our book all three of them will make it like a theme Evening like the fourth of July will get hot dogs and Budweiser and what have you be fun ? So everyone comes to the evening . There s like 300 people in the club and he s all excited about it The first act goes up on stage . He s a black American stand up out of New York City And he does what I would refer to as an uncle Tom routine And if you re not familiar with the terminology that means he did a racist routine all his jokes were based on negative racist stereotypes He got away with it . </s> <s> He was a very charismatic performer . He was very handsome , but the material was It was terrible . I mean it was like at best . It was a white guys drive like this and black guys drive like this nonsense Il observed nonsense at worst it was stuff that would make your skin crawl Okay He totally got away with it that night He got a big round of applause at the end of about half an hour set and he walked back to the green room at the club and My mate went in after him and he went up to him and he said I want a word You ll get paid for tonight s gig . There s no problem with that But you would not be welcome back at my club telling those kind of jokes I think it s racist . I think it s wrong . I don t think it s okay for you to tell racist jokes just because you re a black guy I think if anything you should know better I think it denigrates the struggle of the African American people and you can never say that no one s told you so because I m telling you so right now It s racist and it s wrong and the comedian went I Agree When you re right You re right , but I m the other black comic . I haven t been on yet Don t you mean nothing ? I Couple of quick things sometimes if I buy a girl a drink after the show she gets the wrong idea She thinks I m just a nice guy behind her a drink No , no , no Who s going out after this who s going out tonight ? No , it s a few well , I ve got nothing but aberration . I mean well done , but I can t wait to get home to bed I ve had a lovely night . I ve really enjoyed talking to you , but I want to get to sleep now I ve got to an age where I talk about sleep like I used to talk about sex You should have seen me last night I was active at eight hours I did down sheets blackout blinds the fucking lot The small in the snooze button did not know what fucking hit it Well , let s break out some rough stuff . It s that time of the evening Tell you a couple of jokes that channel four told me were not acceptable Okay , it was the week of the tsunami remember the tsunami All I wanted to say was the tsunami was terrible Tokyo was covered in raw fish and seaweed a situation the mayor described as delicious Could have been more so good said delicious I didn t because that would have been raised elacism I had a similar thing with hurricane Sandy remember hurricane Sandy that devastated the eastern seaboard of America All I wanted to say was it was the worst thing to hit New York since those two planes Possibly they got it right on that one I tend to get into trouble with the papers for a joke once a year obviously last year I went rogue By tend to get trouble for a joke with a journalist once a year last year the joke that got me into trouble with the journalist Was was this one you probably remember it from the last show ? </s> <s> Why are they called sunshine variety coaches when all the kids on board look the same ? Now the world variety is doing a lot of the heavy lifting in that joke , right ? There s not that bad the journalist in question said you can t say that about retarded children Time out Because variety the children s charity they do great work They do a last up with mentally disadvantaged children But they also do a lot of stuff with physically disadvantaged children and socially disadvantaged children You can t lump all those kids together and go bunch of retarded kids You can t call anyone retarded kids You re a journalist you should know better and also being offended on behalf of someone else in my mind Is it three fuck all that s just you taking the high moral ground for you to be offended I think minimum you have to be the one that s offended so if you genuinely offended by that last joke you re retarded While we re talking about charitable stuff as you leave this evening There s going to be a bucket collection there s people with buckets and tins and I ll just briefly tell you what it s about We re collecting money this evening for abused children and if we raise between us just five hundred pounds we can buy Their silence That s clearly a joke right The reason I say that s clearly a joke is because I did a gig in Croid in a couple of months ago and a woman genuinely came up to me after the show and went Where are those collection tints ? Just on pick that for a second so no need to she not realize that was a joke she wanted to help Is anyone totally unafended by anything I ve said You re totally unafended by anything what was your name sir ? Hamdi it s unusual name you don t hear that every day . I imagine you do it . She fucking name Have you got you do handy your student what are you studying ? Economics whereabouts Royal Holloway will maybe if you d worked a little bit harder for your A levels Just say Royal Holloway is not I mean come on there are universities that have always been universities There are universities it used to be politics that then became universities and then there s Royal Holloway which I think used to be a 24 hour garage And they got delivery books and they fucking went with it got love yet Right let me try an Avenger All right when I was at school mate of mine got called wanking in the showers Nothing Well it ruined the school trip to Auschwitz It s not gonna get you more offenses than that dude to joke about the worst thing that has ever happened I can t tell you a more offensive joke than that but I can t tell you a story about me There will change your mind about me and then change it right back Do you want to hear it ? Okay , well it concerns it s it s basically telling you about what it s like being famous What it s like is people ask you to do things and it s nice to say yes because normally it s fun stuff Do you want to be on top here ? Yes , I do do you want to do a Jubilee ? </s> <s> Yes , I do do you want to come and visit a hospice It s palliative care for teenagers . Yes , I do I got that call about six years ago . I said yeah , I ll go I didn t know what some of those words meant I thought sounds all right teenagers . I imagine that would be fun now it transpires palliative translates to dying and I found myself in a situation where I went well , I ve got to go I said I ll go and thinking this is gonna be shit And I m hard . I thought this is gonna be fucking shit But I said I go so I go so I went there with very low expectations I thought I m gonna I ll be lucky to get through this without tearing up I went there was genuinely I can t believe what a fucking asshole I am Because it was genuinely inspirational it was brilliant to go if you get a chance to visit a hospice go to a hospice They re amazing because I don t know what inspires you But I like that idea of carpe diem living in the moment now being where happiness is and if you meet life limited teenagers They re having that because they re aware of how precious time is and I think we often forget in our day to day lives It s so it was amazing to go and to be around I ll be back many times since and I d recommend it as a thing to do It s really fun . They don t want to be shut away They want to be part of society the thing that blew me away when I went there was an incident So if I go out to get coffee before the show if I got a Starbucks obviously my coffee shop of choice Similar views But if I go out to get coffee before the show right there s a group of 15 year old girls in the coffee shop They ll be really flirty with me not because I m some super attractive dude But because I m a celebrity and there s a cash a to celebrity in our society for better for worse There just is it s a fact so I m used to that kind of flirting in that context I wasn t expecting it within the context of palliative care for teenagers in a hospice There s a girl in there she just turned 15 pretty little thing and she s a massive comedy fan And she had all the DVDs it s seen everything on YouTube like really into it and she was really flirty and really tactile And I thought what all she wanted was a kiss and I thought well , where s the harm ? She s gonna be dead before she can test to find I Can see you think that s bad I can make that worse We re just too words true story It is a true story just happens to be about a different Jimmy Thank you so much for coming out and I m just gonna say it by drinking all my shit Right final thought if only Africa had more mosquito nets than every year we could save millions of mosquitoes from dying needlessly of AIDS You </s>"

        "transcript": "<s> Thank you , thank you , thank you for coming to my show , alcoholics , it s a big theatre , man . I appreciate coming out people watching this at home , I know this is a fucking Monday night so I appreciate how many people have come and I realised that in this economy tickets for things such as comedy shows aren t that cheap for men , for women , same price they ve always fucking been , are they ? Women don t pay for things like this , there s women in this room have no fucking idea how much the ticket for this show costs , no fucking idea , your husband came home said remember we re seeing Jim Jeffries you said who and now you re fucking here , women don t pay , basically women are a bunch of cunts to sell my eyes , women are cunts , see I don t have women in another drinks cost money , you know , ugly chicks though if you know that drinks cost money you re a fucking ugly bitch but otherwise you re a good looking girl , good luck dear , say my , my birthday s on Valentine s Day so even on my fucking birthday I m buying some bitch dinner , if I meet a nice girl and I m in a restaurant and the check comes and I put the credit card down and she s a nice girl she ll do the purse grab and if I go no no no it s okay she s very quick to give up on that argument , other arguments she can keep going for fucking years , but that one she s ever so gracious about , this is what I think I like to be gay , I think gay would be a good move for me , I wouldn t enjoy the sex I d have to get through the sex , I would have a cock in my mouth with tears streaming down my face and as the jizz hit the back of my throat I d be thinking of my happy place but it d be worthwhile just so I could split the occasional bill , that s why gay guys are happy and that s why lesbians are fucking miserable , lesbians are fucking miserable people because they have to hang out with women all day , it must be fucking horrible , they must just be sitting there at dinner going I m not going to pay for this bitch , I ve just worn my best plaid shirt and shaved my head she d better treat me like a princess , now if there s any lesbians in the room and I assure you , I m not going to assume there s not because laughter s not your thing , but if there is I d like to apologise for that last joke , but if you hate men so much , stop trying to look like them , you never see a Jew dressed as a Nazi , I did a joke in America , I said lesbians have no sense of humour and they re not fun or whatever and these two lesbians stood up and stormed out of the room as if to prove my point , they re just not fun people , gay guys are fun , I don t care how homophobic you are , if you re holding a dinner party and a gay guy shows up you get a little bit excited , you re like oh fucking a gay guy , I ll strap yourself in love , hey , I ve got a live one , right , but if you re holding a dinner party and lesbians shows up you re just like ah fuck me , all I wanted to do was relax and play picture and then you re like oh my god , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , I m so sorry , he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he Kant fucking love being gay , the way gay comes from happy , they like fucking men in the air so much , they ve called it happy , I ve been a heterosexual my whole life , I would not call the experience happy , I would call it a struggle at best , I ll tell you another reason I must be awesome to be a gay guy , it must be wonderful to be in a relationship where if your partner s being a dickhead you can punch him in the head , hasn t that got to give your relationship a whole new dimension , I can t tell you the amount of arguments I ve had with women that could have been sorted out quicker with a punch , and why were the subject of domestic violence , it s a horrible thing of course it is , and now , you ever met a woman who s like been married like four times , she s like I guess I just choose the wrong type of men , I ve been married four times and all my husbands beat me , and you re like all of them , all four , one , two , three , fucking four , they all beat you , someone doesn t know when to shut the fuck up , now do it , because I m a tolerant man , I ll give anyone three but four , you re a fucking button pusher , you re a nice cheery way to start the show , I do a lot of gigs , I want a lot of do some gigs out in Iraq and Afghanistan and stuff like that , which if I was in an American crowd right now they re like oh yeah , but I m not so I can be honest with you , I do it for money , and the first time , over there it s like I m king of it , the first time I go do a gig in Iraq , they find me and my manager in a passenger plane into Kuwait , now it turns out that Kuwait is a regular country that anyone can visit , then a military truck gets me and my manager and drives us over the border into Iraq and drops us off , and we re staying in the middle of the desert of a war torn country , we can t see anything on the horizon , and I turn to my manager and go good booking fuckface , and then there s helicopter comes in over the horizon and lands in front of us and the blades are still going and this soldier runs off and goes excuse me , are you Jim Jeffries ? </s> <s> And I went what other white cunt were you looking for in the desert , at this exact location , then he hands me my bulletproof face to my helmet , he s obviously wearing his bulletproof face in his helmet , his a camouflage mine , fucking blue , and I said why do I have a blue face to helmet , he said that s so the enemy know you re a civilian , I m like does the enemy give a shit , that s why I m making some , because I ve never been a sniper , but every time I got off the helicopter I surrounded my soldiers protecting me , if I was a sniper I d be like the cut and blue looks important , right so , we got this helicopter , and we re sitting in this chopper , that s what we call them in the chopper , and I m sitting here , I got two soldiers sitting next to me there , my manager Brett sitting there , he s got two soldiers sitting next to him , there s two soldiers in the cockpit , there s a great big door open next to me there , and there s another door open there , and at that door there s a soldier with a great big gun on a hinge with bullets coming out of it like that thing that s you back away , and we take off and off we go to Baghdad , and as we hit the border of the city I hear a great big bang , and these two small flares shoot out from the small wings of the helicopter , fired by a trailer smoke , and then the helicopter goes , now the reason they do this is when they get over the danger if there s a heat seeking missile it ll be distracted by the flares , and then the helicopter will fly out of range , very clever , now they never told me this was happening as far as I m concerned the wings have just exploded , and we re now plummeting to our death , it is it s nice to know how you react under pressure , because I reacted thusly by vomiting over my lovely blue vest , ironically making it more camouflage than it was before , and yelling out we re going down the two pilots , the soldiers , the gunner , they all start pissing themselves laughing , they re reaching through , they re high five at each other , it turns out they ve been waiting for this joke for months , I m cleaning vomit off myself going , ah here you go , it s a goo , I thank you for defending my freedom , right ? So I sit back down covered in vomit in the helicopter , and so I m trying to look out the door to try to unquease myself , I m looking out over the ground over Baghdad , by the way , Baghdad , beautiful city untouched , and I look out on the ground , and I see a little aromfellow with a handgun shooting up at the helicopter just once again a freak out , we ll be in fire , the gunner now is laughing so fucking hard , he s laughing even harder than he s before , he s laughing so hard , he s killed over the guns just dangling out in the hands , and I m like what s your fucking problem man , and he s like Jim , you got to have to calm down mate , we re in a military helicopter with a bullproof bottom , that s a handgun , we re so high up the bullets can t even reach us , they just sort of go and then I jokingly said , I bet our bullets can reach him and he went , oh yeah , and the little cunt died , and I was like , I was just saying mate , I was just saying , and he wouldn t have ruined anyone s day , and that a fun story about a man dying , it s funny though my limited time in a war zone , I didn t see what all the bad stuff was , they were very nice to me , but this war was going to crazy to me because I don t know historically how we re going to talk about it , so like my grandfather , he fought during the Second World War for the Japs weirdly enough , no no for the Australians , he killed a lot of Japanese , hated until he died , love the food , hate the people he used to say , what a complex man , I used to love listening , when I was a kid listening to him tell stories about killing Nazis , there was always something exciting about it , I just don t know what I will tell my grandson about what s happened in history now , I imagine I ll be 80 years old , I ll be sitting in my chair , and my grandson will be on the floor looking up at me adoringly , and I ll go , now there used to be these people called Arabs , and they lived in the Middle East , or as you call it the radiation zone , in 2020 , President Maccoly Colcan got really upset with the Arabs and he nuked them all , but what Maccoly Colcan and the rest of the Americans hadn t realized was that China had slowly but surely become the superpower of the world , so why the Americans were nuking the Arabs , the Chinese , nuked the Americans , and that s where we have no Americans and no Arabs , and then my grandson will look up at me and go , mash it by , oh , I , you know what I like about that joke , it has the feel of racism but you can t pick the exact moment , well you know it is , it s definitely racist , so let s change subject quickly , how to blind people wipe their asses , I know you re thinking the same as us , but you re not thinking outside the box , because wiping your ass is a very visual activity , no one s ever just lent up , wiped , then dropped into the bowl , you wipe , you check , there s a lot of poo there , I m going to wipe again , there s still a lot of poo , it feels dry but there s still poo , I think I left one up there , I bet that s where the dog comes in handy , no , no , no , I m not saying the dog licks the blind person s ass , I m saying these are very intelligent dogs , they would have worked out some form of barking system , so the blind guy would have the dog like sitting front of him , well , well , well , well , well , they d probably work out some special more scoty bark for when there s blood in the poo , no , no , because they ve already been through a rough time , they re blowing no need for ass cancer , no , no , that blood always means ass cancer , I suffer from hemorrhoids , I ve done since I was 22 , years old , and it s very young age to get hemorrhoids , but there s a lot of blood involved , if you ve never had one , there s a lot of blood involved in a bad hemorrhoid , I ve had toilet balls that look like abortions , no , it s not good , and the first time when you re 22 when you get one , your brain goes to ask cancer , you re like , oh , I got to ask cancer , because no one ever tells you about hemorrhoids when you re young , you don t ever sit you down and goes , when you get a bit older , you ll be pushing a poo a little bit hard and a small portion of your asshole will fall out , now it s nothing to be alarmed about , it s just part of becoming a man , so the first time I got a hemorrhoid , I didn t tell anyone , because I thought I was dying obviously , and I go to his same doctor , the same doctor , I ve had my whole life , and he makes me , I go , I got to ask cancer , and he makes me , he makes me bend over a chair , and then he gets a rubber glove on , he sort of prods around my ass a little bit , and he goes , oh , you ve just got hemorrhoids there , and I said , I thought that only happens to old people and pregnant women , and he went , and you ! </s> <s> So , I live in America now , and I , people get so entertained by that , but where else am I going to put them ? We ll put that away for congenuity in case they cut the jokes up differently . There we go , that s a bit of a , because I know there s people who are seeing home going , that beer went like that , then it went like that , then it went like that , fucking nerds . So , I live in America , it s like a plasma mine , I live in America now , I come from Australia and everything , I never thought I d sort of go this far with my career or anything , and I find myself now I m out there auditioning for major movies and shit , and I still feel retarded every time I go in there . Now , the first time I went for an audition , I d been in LA for like a couple days , and my agency sent me into this audition , and I went along , and I met this girl in the corridor called Carla , and I was really nervous , and she could tell I was nervous , and she sort of calmed me down , and we had a little bit of a chat , and she was really cute , and we flirted together and stuff , and then I d red red the little bit , and then I went home , and then I got a call , the later on that afternoon , they loved you , you re going to come back for a callback , so I m like , excellent , that s good , so I go back for a callback , and when you do callbacks , often they have you reading with another person , so I m in the room reading with his girl , and it s the same girl with a corridor , it s Carla , right , and we re sort of flirting , and then the thing is before you re , and so we re reading , we have great on screen chemistry , and all type of stuff , and then after the audition I said , I said , Carla , do you have any taxi cab numbers ? I got to get to me next audition , she said , where are you trying to get to , and I went Santa Monica , and she said , that s where I m going , I ll give you a lift . Now , please note at this stage of the story , I didn t ask for the lift , where you go down to the car , she gets in , she unwinds me window , she looks out and goes , Jim , what s your full name ? And I went , Jim Jeffries , and she went , wait there , and she called a mum up and said , hi mum , it s Carla , I just met a very nice boy at the audition today , and I m going to give him a lift , but in case I get raped or murdered , his name s Jim Jeffries , so if you don t hear from me an hour , assume something bad has happened , and call the cops . </s> <s> Get in Jim , so I go in , we go like a 15 mile drive , I say fucking nothing for the first five miles , I just look forward , and eventually I turn to her and go , you ve just made this rape really awkward , she fucking freaks out , she slams her full on the brakes , she skids off the highway , she starts slapping at me , I m grabbing a wrist now , I feel kind of rapier , I didn t want to , and it s like you offered the lift , I didn t ask for the fucking lift , you seem more concerned in solving this crime than preventing it , so I raped her to teach her a lesson , how else would she learn ? Now let s get a little bit deeper , I suffer from depression , I have done my whole life , I ve been suicidal on and off for the last sort of 10 years , it s something that I sort of deal with on a day to day basis , and I m on antidepressives , but on the box it says they don t work if you drink , so I m not on antidepressives , but whatever I get depressed or down , I always feel like a selfish arsehole for doing it , because it s really a childish act to be depressed , do you realise that we hear in the first world countries , Canada , America , Australia , Britain , not Scotland , where , you know these major countries , they re all the good ones , do you know we have a high rate of suicide than the people of Africa ? Let s just think about that for a second , right ? The people in Africa , one in four of them are dying from AIDS , they re sitting in a grass , fucking hut in their own shit , they walk five miles to get water with a fucking jug on their head , yet they re happier than you . You re sitting at home with a fucking pantry full of food watching fucking X factor or a 700 channels go , I m not happy ! And you want no way you re not happy ? Because we were brought up on dreams , and even when I said that you re all silent , because all of you were going , you ve been in my fucking mind dreams . You think dreams are wonderful don t you ? You think dreams are the great thing on earth , you gotta have dreams , you know what happens with dreams that don t happen , you fucking , you know what dreams are like in Africa ? Don t die today , don t die today , don t die today , that s a real fucking dream . And I m as guilty as you man , when I was a young comic , all I wanted to do was go on stage for five minutes to make people laugh , and then I thought , fuck that man , they better pay me . And then they started paying me , and I went , I bet at least , I better be a headline act , became a headline act , then I went to the Edinburgh Festival , did fucking that , and then I went , all right I better go over to America , whenever America , I recorded my DVD in America , and then I was like , yeah , that s too fucking right , now I want to be a movie star , and you know what , I m not a movie star , and I want to kill myself . </s> <s> That s retarded , I have gone further than a man of my looks or intellect should ever fucking go . And at this fucking moment , I m in a sold out theatre in fucking London , in the West End , this would be a dream of mine as a child , and you know what I m gonna do tonight ? Cry myself to sleep ! Because I was taught to dream , because you never complete your dreams , you do complete them , but then what you do , you put another one on , and then another one on , and then when you die , you ll be on the death of your going , my dream is to see my grandkids again , then they don t come and you die fucking miserable . You re never gonna complete all of them , no one s ever gone , I got no more dreams left , I m fucking done . So I m not gonna dream anymore , fuck that , I m gonna make little tiny achievable dreams that I can achieve , like for instance , I was drunk last night , so my dream for this evening is not to shit myself on stage . Now it might happen , it might not happen , but if it does happen , I ll wash myself off and start again , because I m a dreamer . But it s not our fault , this is bread into us , this is in our psyche , you can t fix things that have been said to you as a child , like when we re at school , we had schoolteachers standing in front of every single one of us and go , if you work hard and you put your mind to it , you can achieve anything . You know what that was ? That was a fucking lie . You can t achieve anything , nobody can , don t put that pressure on yourself . Everybody in the world has limitations , no matter how hard I think about it , no matter how hard I practice , never being the NBA , because I m a fat white guy , not a tall black guy . Like , do you remember that fat fucking dumb ugly kid who couldn t fucking catch a ball ? You know those kids are like , if he was like , why don t I kiss more , you get benefits ? But he s just on the border of retardation , right ? That kid was told he could achieve anything . Right ? You know what they should have done with that kid ? They could have gone , oh he keven your fat prick . Dig a fucking hole your dumb can t . All right , you fucked that up as well , but no one else wants to do it , so you got the gig big boy . And while I m at it , if you re a dumb ugly can t and you wife or your husband s a dumb ugly can t , guess what your fucking kids are ? Your kids are dumb ugly cans just like fucking you , except they re fucking super concentrate , dumb ugly cans , because they come from both of you into a bottleneck of fucking retardation . But you still think they re the greatest things all right ? You go to their soccer games , kick the ball , John , you re doing a good job , he s getting better . </s> <s> You should fucking lock that thing up . It doesn t matter if you re an idiot and you re stupid and you can t fucking catch a ball and everything in your life is retarded because you know you ll always be welcome with God . God loves the stupid and the fucking . . . This is the thing about people who believe in God . They re idiots . There s no dancing around it . You re a borderline fucking mentalist , you re an idiot . You re like a 13 year old kid who still believes in Santa . I m still gonna get . . . Oh fuck you . You know , I don t hate people who believe in God . I don t hate them , right ? But I just don t want to talk to them . I don t want to be around them . It s like how I don t hate the mentally insane , right ? But the mentally insane and religious people are the same fucking bag . If I m staying at a bar chatting to either of them , eventually I ll walk away going , okay . See , do you know , I live in America . I have to deal with this all fucking day . Okay , 85 of Americans believe in God . That s mental . Here in Britain it s like 36 in Australia . It s 27 in , I think in Canada it s like in the 60s . And in Russia , no one . Do you want no why ? Because it s fucking cold . No one believes in God . So all the Russians they don t get to go to heaven because they were born in the wrong country . Born in the wrong country , you don t get to go to heaven . Americans born in the right country . Hey , you get to go to heaven . You re born in the right place because God s very particular about where you re born . Right , so half of you fucking can t get to go to heaven because you re British . Few Australians get to go and then the Americans all get to go and most of the Canadians get to fucking go and then there s those dumb cunts in those musy countries . Hey , they don t even believe in the right God . They re fucking dead . They re not going . And what about those dumb Asian fucks ? Hey , with that fuck come putter , they don t get to go to heaven because they re made up of God that doesn t exist . And then there s the Indians with the fucking monkey elephant guy . What is wrong with them ? They must be retarded . They re believing in the wrong God . Not us though . We were born in the right country . There s God selects countries . That s why they always say God bless America because the world s billions of years old and America s 250 years old and that s when God decided to choose a team . Do you know there s a web page called Ask God where children can write questions to God and then through the power of the internet . </s> <s> God will answer them . I m a bit dubious but I . So the most asked question and ask God is were there kangaroos in the ark ? So children could ask any question in the world but a child s mind works like this . They go I like kangaroos . I think the ark stories bullshit so shazam . And the answer to that question is although there are no mention of kangaroos in the Bible , it does state that there was two of each animal so you can be assured that there were kangaroos in the ark . Now why is there no mention of kangaroos in the Bible ? Could it be that when the Bible was written Australia hadn t been found therefore no mention of kangaroos ? But didn t God create kangaroos ? Isn t the Bible written through the hand of man through the voice of God ? Why wouldn t he mention the kangaroos ? They re such an exciting animal . It seems to me that they only seem to mention things in the Bible that are within a five mile radius of the guy writing it . Like if I was God at the end of the Bible I would have lent in and gone , oh tell him it s round . There s uh , didn t know the world was round . Fucking build it didn t know it was round . Now , I just like , uh , religious people I didn t say , don t just , we ll go back . Now , the thing is what I hate about Christians is they start sentences like this as a Christian . You can t start a sentence like that and explain to me that your rest of your sentence has any more meaning than the beginning of the sentence . It means bullshit . That s a little fucking get out of jail free card shit you do . Right ? Because I can t get in court and start a sentence like this . As an atheist , I didn t rape him . Didn t rape him . He was , he was , he was giving me a lift . And now , when I started this show , my first routine was about how lesbians were fat , ugly , useless with no sense of humour . And you couldn t applaud more . Then I killed an Arab man from a fucking helicopter , just shot him dead . Then I said that there s no Christian , there Christians are bullshit and there is no God . And that s the moment when half the audience chose to be offended . Was that the fucking moment that got you ? How very Christian of you towards the Muslims and the lesbians . Next time , start your sentences with , well , as a hypocrite . Now , I ll tell you this last thing about you . </s> <s> You think you re a good person because you have Christian values . Do you want to know what Christian values are ? Christian values are a load of shit . What are Christian values ? The Ten Commandments . One of the Ten Commandments is very sensible rules to live your life by . But you know what s a load of shit about them ? The fact that you had to have them written down . The fact you couldn t figure out internally not to kill people . Don t steal . Really ? You should just know these . You should be internal in you . The Bible is too wordy . All the stories are too wordy . The Ten Commandments are a load of shit . You don t need all these things . The Bible should be one sheet of paper . And on that sheet of paper , it should say , try not to be a cunt . And if you do that every day , you ll be a good person . We try to sell this show to the Americans . I don t like our chances . So let s do something we can all enjoy . Sometimes when I m fucking a chick , I go to fucking again in the morning and they ll say something like this . No . When we fucked last night , it was a little bit dry . And now I m sore . Now , to any woman who said something similar to this , my eyes say , your problem . My job was to get an erection . Your job was to get your whole wet . Didn t you get your whole wet ? We both had things to do . See , if I don t get an erection during sex , I m called impudent . But a dry hole is the same as a flasopena . A dry hole is an impudent hole and you re not a complete woman and you should be ashamed of yourself . But women don t take responsibility for the dry hole . If I go to fuck a chick tonight and I get too drunk , which I will , and I go to fuck a chick and I don t get an erection . She ll go back to friends ago . Oh , I went to fuck that Jim Jeffries . He couldn t get an erection . But if I go to fuck a chick and she doesn t get wet , she ll go back to a friend and go , I fucked Jim Jeffries . He didn t even get me wet . Do you see the problem there ? I m in charge of everything . It s like , I used to fuck this chick for a while . I stopped fucking her . She sent me a text , well , yeah , I just stopped calling her , you know , just ignored her . She sent me a text message a month later that went , oh , by the way , you never made me come . And I was like , really ? You think you re the one who makes me come ? </s> <s> Do you want to know who makes me come ? I make me come . All the horrible thoughts I have in my fucking head makes me come . You have very little to do with it . You re the honest to container I shoot it into . But let s go back to the dry cunt . There are women in the room who are thinking , maybe I wouldn t be dry if there was a bit of foreplay . Let s explain foreplay . Foreplay is what we do to each other , get each other ready for sex . If I have an erection , that means I m ready for sex . And I m all foreplayed out . Now , the foreplay that s necessary for a woman goes like this . You gotta start by kissing them . Women love kissing . Men don t give a shit about kissing . We kiss her because we like her . And let s be honest , we spoil you . Men don t give a fuck about kissing . You used to like kissing when we were in our early teens . Then someone sucked our dick . And then , what s this kissing thing ? Why am I kissing this person ? Why would I ride on the swings ? I ve already been to Disneyland . Carry on over . Baha ! We kiss her because we like her and we re a charitable bunch . Then you start kissing down the neck . Now , the whole time you re doing this , you re working downwards towards the cunt . Now , you know you go into the cunt . She knows you go into the cunt . Everybody knows you go into the cunt . But for some unknown reason , you have to act like you re not going to the code . And that you re enjoying the journey of this creature . Women , you gotta give them a journey . Men don t give a shit about a journey . If a man s driving from point A to point B , we fill the tank , we get on the motorway , we make good time . Right ? Women , you gotta give them a fucking journey . You gotta take them by the water and teaking or some shit . So you think his women reach so many magazines about how to send your man wild and how to titlate your man in all these 25 steps to do all these . So I d a fucking bullshit . Oh , you get a feather involved food in the relationship . This is all bullshit . Play with these nipples . These things are fucking dead . Dead to me . These mean nothing . You could cut these off and donate them to some poor African child without nipples . I wouldn t give a fuck . This is what we want you to do . Fucking suck out cock and cup our balls . And when you suck in our cock , look like you re in a bit of pain because we enjoy it if you look uncomfortable . </s> <s> Anyway , but back to the lady . You keep kissing down . Now you re at the tits . Now tits are a mixed bag . Some tits you gotta be firm with , some tits you gotta be soft with , some tits you can bite the nipple , some tits don t go in the nipple . Tits are like golf . You play the course you re on . You keep kissing down . Now you re at the cunt . But even when you get to the cunt , you have to act like you re not at the cunt . You have to act like you ve stumbled upon the cunt by accident . So you ll be kissing like a dimpley bit of thigh here . And the cunt s there . And you have to sort of almost , oh , hello . I was visiting dimpley thigh . I forgot you lived down here . Now always a pleasure , never a joy . Do you mind if I pop in ? Then you lick the whole general con area . Then there s a bit at the top of the cunt . If you lick that , they seem to enjoy it . This all takes between 10 and 40 minutes . And she might be wet . And that s the four play that s necessary for a woman . Now the four play that s necessary for a man . We just need to see you naked . Maybe you need kisses , caresses , compliments and licks . When all we need is you . Maybe we take our relationship seriously . I m just . . . Wasn t that a romantic joke ? And all the word cunt 15 days . All right , we have to keep moving the shogs . We need to have a piss now . Because I ve been drinking too much . I always get nervous before things like this . And so I got hampered in the dressing room . This is the shogs called alcoholic . That means the death of alcohol . Because I m planning to stop drinking after this Edinburgh festival . I m not promising . But I d like to . . . This might be the last DVD I record where I m drunk . So the next DVD is going to suck balls . The living in the college of alcoholic . And now , because I live in America , some Jewish people have gotten offended . And I m like , no , it s not like I m at the holocaust getting people drunk . Just the funny word . I tell you what though , I did a gig in Poland . And when I was out there , because I did a corporate gig in Poland . I went out to Auschwitz . See , a lot of you uneducated people thought I was in Germany . You know , Auschwitz is in Poland . And I went out there . And apart from the concentration campy bit in the corner , the rest of it s delightful . It s a beautiful little village . It s . . . I reckon that tourism board needs to get together and go , okay . We have a bit of a bad rap . </s> <s> Does anyone got any ideas ? Hans , give it to me . Yep , that s true . We do have the biggest tower of second hand shoes in the world . I don t know . . . I don t know if that s a keeper . But write it down . Yo Han , even though that s a Scandinavian name . Uh huh . And how pizza festival you say . As we can cook 400 pizzas at once . These bit wired being the DVD . It s funny , Jenga . I . . . I like living in Britain because my , um , my obvious alcohol problem . Um , isn t it a problem here ? Before I came on stage here , my manager , the last thing he said to me was , did he know the drink ? That would never happen in America . When I recorded my special in America , they employed someone to stand by the bar to make sure I didn t get wasted . Because Americans don t really drink like you people drink . Like they think they do . But they re very into , like , drinking games . Which you people , they have drinking games , right ? Whenever I m out drinking in America , it s like college boy who comes and we go , he did . Ever played beer pong ? And I wear , like , what s beer pong ? When you ve got to get a ping pong ball , you ve got to throw it in the cup . If you don t get it in the cup , then you ve got to chuck your beer . And I m like , well , let me just get this straight . I m trying to get drunk . And you re putting an activity in front of me that may impede me from getting to my beverage . I said , they have a drinking game in England . Do you want to know what it s called ? Drinking ! How many of these hours play ? What you do is you have a drink , then you get another drink . You have a drink , have a drink , have a drink , have a drink , have a drink , have a drink , have a drink , have a drink . You do this as fast as you can . And if you get so drunk that your friend has to drive you home , then you fucking win . How many more do you reckon there s behind you ? There s a dwarf behind there mixing me a cocktail . I am fucking drunk now . All right . I m going to tell you a story . This story is very long . The first three minutes of this story are very depressing . Just hitching up the pants . Firstly minutes of this story very depressing . There is a moment where this story takes flight . And you have to hang in there with me until this moment and trust me that the story is going to get good . I grew up at number three , Tara Maristreet . And number five was my two best childhood friends , Andrew and Daniel Conner . Daniel was born with a disease called muscular dystrophy . If you don t know what muscular dystrophy is , the horrible disease that wastes away your muscles . </s> <s> It s the same as lugex disease . I m not a neurone disease except you re born with it . You get diagnosed when you re about six years old when you re not walking right . They put you on crutches . By the time you re 10 , you re in a wheelchair . By the time you re 20 , you re in a completely vegetated state . Most people die before their 25th birthday . Dan s lived to be 33 years old . Still alive and kicking . Let me replace that . Still alive . He s actually died seven times in his life and been resuscitated . Seven . And I once asked him , I said , Dan , what happens after you die ? And he said , nothing . So good luck with your religion and your faith . I ll take an actual statistic . I ll take a statistic . Now his family had since moved to Melbourne . I had moved to the Great Britain . I went to do the Melbourne Comedy Festival . It was about a year ago . I hadn t seen him in all that time . His brother , Andrew , came to see my show . And then Andrew took me to see Dan . And I went in to see him . And I never seen him . I lived this long with his disease . And he s laying on a bed . His eyelids are a muscle that he can t keep open anymore . He has a breathing mask on him to keep his lungs working because the lungs are a muscle that he can t keep pumping . He has a heart monitoring machine in case he flatlines in the middle of the night and someone has to resuscitate him . And as soon as I walked in and saw this guy , they used to run around with as a child . I burst into tears . There s nothing worse . You can give anyone in this world than pity . You know ? I went in the corridor . I felt like a right prick . I was in my eyes off . I went back in . And I sat with Dan . His brother , Andrew , went off to work . I mean , Dan chatted for a while . 20 minutes into the conversation , Dan says to me , Jim , I m 32 years old . I ve never been with a woman . Will you take me to a prostitute ? And that s where the story picks up , right ? Because I went fucking ! And he said , I m not going to tell my brother . He wouldn t understand . I said , that s where you re wrong . I have known your brother my entire life . Trust me , he will understand . And against Dan s will , when Andrew came home from work , I pulled Andrew s sides and said , Andrew , look , here s the deal . Dan s asked me to take him to a prostitute . I m going to do whether you like it or not . I think as his brother , you should come along and help out . And Andrew went , we re not doing it . He s going to die soon anyway . </s> <s> This is a good way for him to go . Like , sure , we ll have to answer a few questions . And he said , we re not doing it . And I said , why ? And he goes , Mum doesn t like you already . And I went , your mum s never likes me . That s why I m the right guy to kill your brother . And he said , all right , we ll do it . But he can t have full sex . Full sex will kill him . He can only have a blowjob . And I thought that was fairly reasonable . So we went back in and saw Dan . He was where we left him . And he said , Dan , here s the deal . I know you re not told me not to tell you brother , but I told you brother . Me and him are both going to take you to the knock shop tomorrow , mate . But you can t have full sex . You can only have a blowjob . And Dan went , oh , I m full sex . And he s brother , Andrew , and Dan , you re in no position to argue with anyone ever . Then Dan reluctantly agreed . Now , prostitution and Australia is legal . So I spent the rest of the afternoon going through the phone book , trying to find a brothel with wheelchair access . Best afternoon ever . So , I know . Eventually I found one of the biggest brothel in the southern hemisphere , the daily planet , or is the Australians called four floors of halls . It s a 24 hour brothel because Australia is a go ahead country . So we decided we were going to go early in the morning , like really , like 6am . We wanted to go and went into the places quiet , and we weren t going to cause a scene . So we wake him up at 6 o clock in the morning . It s hard to tell if he s awake . And we get him in his chair . Now , he hasn t got your bog standard fucking wheelchair . He s got one of those big silver looking things with the track tyres on it . I think the model s called a Hawking . And . . . Even though his muscles don t work , they get sourced . So this thing can move him from side to side , and back to front , and even into a full bed . So we get him in the chair , then we order a taxi . And then it s not like you have black cabs out there . It s like a normal car , but they ve modified the back to go higher . And they drive him up through the boot , and they strap him in there , and he sits up high with windows all around him , like a big retarded pope . Or as the Catholics would say , the pope . And we drive off to the brothel . Now , when we get to the brothel , it takes 10 minutes to get him off the taxi . I see this is my window of opportunity . So why they re getting him off the taxi ? </s> <s> I run into the brothel . Now , there s two ways the brothels work . Either the prostitutes will stand a row in their laundry , and you just pick the one that you want . Or they ll stand around in a bar , and evening gowns , and high heels , and you walk up to the one that you like to look of , chat to her for a bit , act like you ve got some type of connection with an Eastern European woman , then take her upstairs and fuck her if you need your life to be this delusional . This is one of these situations . So why are they getting down out of the cab ? I run into the brothel and go , everyone , quickly , gather around . I haven t got much time . And these 14 bemused hookers shuffle over , and I went , look , here s the deal . I have a severely disabled friend with me . If you re not up for it , speak now , or forever hold your peace . And one of them went , how bad is he ? And I went , hmmm , pretty fucking bad . And 10 of them said they wouldn t do it . And I said , well , I respect that . But can you please go and hide , because I don t want him to be rejected by hookers ? And these 10 girls shuffle away , and they re evening gowns and they re high heels , we ve got a rear falling out of them . I am now left with four girls , the best looking one by my master s . Dan Wilson , looking like Jabba the Hot Breathing , like Darth Vader . Two of the girls run away , and I m like , you fucking kidding you sluts ! I just asked you nicely . So I am now left with two girls . The best looking ones there , the other ones are fucking troll . Now I ll respect for the ugly one . I go to Dan , I go Dan . So only two girls work in the day , mate . Which one do you want ? And he said the one in the green dress . Now , neither of them had a green dress . I stand up and look at Andrew , and went , what the fuck is all this about ? And Andrew went , oh yeah , his eyes are fucked as well . Now it turns out that Dan s colour blind . It s not part of the condition , it s just unfortunate . So , I sat with the hooker . Now I m going to pay for everything . Now the reason I m going to pay for everything is simple . I told Dan and Andrew that I would pay for everything , as long as I got to tell this story , to hundreds of thousands of people in the future . And they said , of course you can , Jim , but be respectful and change our names . Which sounds like the right thing to do now , doesn t it ? </s> <s> Now I haven t changed their names . Their names are Andrew and Daniel Conner from St . Kildor , Melbourne , Australia . I would have liked to have changed their names . It is the right thing to do . But I look at it this way , even if I change their names , and their parents started watching my comedy , they d be like , my word doesn t Randy and Steve sound like our kids . Didn t Jim grow up with a lot of people with muscular dystrophy ? So I sat there with a hooker and said , how much for a half hour ? And she said , 180 and I said , I ll give you 250 . Because I realized this is a specialty thing you re doing . And she goes , I got one question for you and I said , shoot . And she went , is he mentally retarded ? And I went , oh yeah , that s what I do . I find mentally retarded people and take them to prostitutes . I ll be masturbating in the corner . He doesn t even know he s here . And she went , okay then , but if there s two of you , we ll go , no , he s not mentally retarded . It s his choice to come here . There s a good chance he ll die . And she went , what I m meant to do with him , and I went , I don t know , I ve never been a hooker . But I m thinking , give him a bit of a show , dance around a bit , rub your tits in his face , then suck him off . But don t sit on him or fuck him . It ll kill him . So we go after the room , we think God was on the first floor . And me and Andrew look at Dan , like two proud parents , watching our child go to school for the first time . And then we leave , and as we proceed to leave a pat Andrew in the back , and I said , Andrew , you ve been a good brother today . And he said , thanks mate , and then we had a hug . And then we had that moment after a hug that Australian men have where we go , I get it , what s wrong with you ? And then I said , hey Andrew , how does Dan get his clothes off ? And Andrew went , fuck ! And we went back in . Andrew looks him up and down , and he turns me and goes , look , he s very fragile . I know how he likes to be picked up . I ll lift him up , you take his pants off . Andrew gets behind , lifts him up by his armpits , like I couldn t have figured out their magical hold . Oh my knees , taking Dan s tracksuit pants off . He always wore tracksuit pants , never got into fashion . And as I m taking his tracksuit pants off , what many of you are wondering is , can Dan get an erection ? And the answer is yes . Even though I know the muscles in his body work , the cock is not a muscle , the cock is a bit of skin that fills with blood . </s> <s> If he gets aroused up here , blood rushes there . Now , what nobody knew about this 32 year old virgin is that Dan s packing heat . I m talking nine and a half inches of disabled misery . This cock so fucking big , I think that s why the rest of his muscles didn t work . I take the pants off , this thing springs up and hits me in the mouth . Then the hooker goes , let s do the light . Let s explain the light . When they legalise prostitution in Australia , they didn t legalise it in all forms . For instance , you cannot get a streetwalking hooker , you cannot get a prostitute to your hotel room . You can only go to a brothel in a safe environment where they have security for the girls in case a man shows up being drunk and dickheader . Also , it s safer for the people who go to brothels because the girls get tested for STDs every month . Arguably , you re better off in Australia , fucking a prostitute , than picking up a girl in a bar . But I m not going to have that conversation again . Oh my , you choice explaining that to a girlfriend . It s a fucking minefield . But also , they make it safer for the girls . If you re a guy who goes to a prostitute , you have to undergo the light . Let s explain the light . It s very simple . It sounds like what it is . You put your cock and a very bright light , and they look around the shaft to see if there s anything untoward . Then they get a magnifying glass out . They go through your pubes to make sure nothing s running around . It s not a big deal . I ve been rejected heaps of time . Now , the chair s here . There s a bed here . There s a hot tub there . The light s over there . Now , we try to get the chair past the bed and the hot tub , but we can t get it through . So me and Andrew walk over the hooker and we re whispering because we don t want Dan to hear . We re like , we can t do the light thing . And she goes , if you don t do the light , I m not doing it . And me and Andrew went , aww , come on . He s a virgin . What s the worst that can happen ? And she whispered , actually , a more concerned about its cleanliness . And then his brother , Andrew , said loudly and proudly . I washed it before we came out . Now , you may think you re a good brother , good sister , good mother , good daughter , whatever the fuck you think you are in this world . But you re nothing until you ve washed your disabled brother s cock to take him to a prostitute . That is love , ladies and gentlemen . Terrible fucking love . So we looked at Dan . Everyone agreed . It was time to go . We looked at Dan . I mean , Andrew looked at him and went , we re going now , mate . If you ve got anything you want to say to us , say it now because we re going to leave , mate . </s> <s> And this is what Dan did . I m not going to say it now . I m not going to say it now . Yeah . Leave . So , me and Andrew went back down to the bar and we hanged out with the hookers . We re like ten of them sort of mulling around here . We re standing there . I don t know what Dan s up to , but we re standing around the bar with all the hookers . And then five guys from London walk into the bar who are obviously out of their fucking skulls on Coke . Now , if you ve never taken a lot of Coke , then I ve been , aww . If anyone s got news , you want to be . . . No , if you ve never taken a Coke , you know , when like five or six guys get together and take Coke on like a Tuesday , there comes a point at about six in the morning when we go , we better call up some chicks . Maybe you call up ex girlfriends , like bring some friends , bring some friends . I don t know what you re expecting . So , basically , I think it was a Wednesday we did this . I think these guys have been on Coke all night and they ve obviously gone , let s go down the brothel , go down the brothel , be final girl , go down the brothel . And I was saying the bar chatting with the hookers and these five guys from London walk in and one of them recognises me and goes , Jim , fucking Jeffries . Jim , fucking Jeffries . Oh , no , you make . . . I know you , the committee , the spas approved guys , but you re the committee . And I went , hey , how do you do them ? And he goes , hey , Jim , Jim , Jim , Jim , Jim , Jim . You want to want to Coke ? And I went , yes . And I went off to the toilet and did a loan of Coke . And I come back out and obviously I ve left Andrew alone for too long and he was sort of panicking all by himself and I sort of walk in . What s wrong ? And he goes , what if we ve done the wrong thing here ? What if he s in there dying right now ? What if he stopped fucking breathing or what the fuck , he s heart stopped ? What the fuck are we meant to do ? I said , not a problem , not a problem . I ll resuscitate him . And he said , do you know how to do that ? I said , no , I don t , but how high can it be ? Push , push , blow , blow . I haven t embellished that in the slightest . That s the exact thing I said to him . Push , push , blow , blow . Then the prostitute walks back in the room , who was with Dan . So I m staying with the five Coke fiends , ten prostitutes . She walks in the room , it s like that moment in a movie with a needle on the record just sort of goes , eh ! And everything stopped . </s> <s> And she walked in and she said , well , it s over . And me and Andrew and Unison went , is he dead ? And her exact words were , I didn t check that . So me , Andrew , the five Coke fiends , the ten hookers , we all run to the room . Now he s not dead , he s jazzed back in the upright position , his cock is still sitting up majestically , covered in jizz and spit . But for a man who had an hour ago couldn t lift his eyelids , he was sitting there like this . Now he might be wondering why his eyelids are up like that . Let me explain something , it wasn t through happiness . Tell you something about yourself , I m 33 years old . I ve been masturbating since I was 10 years old . And in that time , I have not missed the day . Every single day I masturbate , haven t missed a fucking day . Every day I m in a hotel room with a laptop way high up in my chest here . So I don t have to look at the filth I m doing to myself . So I m watching porn here . And nine times out of ten I hit the apple sign . Right ? And I do this every single fucking day . Yet I would be mortified if any one of you was to ever see me doing this . I would want to fucking kill myself . And I do this every single fucking day . Now imagine if you ve never ejaculated through the power of yourself . You ve never had another person do it . You re 32 years old . And for the first time you ve shot a lot out of fucking stale jizzle over the fucking room . And you re sitting there with your cock out and 15 strangers walks in . And you do not possess the power to put your cock away . Can you see how that might be a bit unhinge ? So we had to get him dressed quickly . But there s come everywhere . And this time I look him up and down . I turned to Andrew . I said , Andrew , I don t give a fuck how fragile he is . I m taking the top half this time . And we lifted him up . And we put his pants on him . And we proceeded to leave the brothel . Now as we left the brothel , I turned to Dan . I said , Dan , a pay for a story . Please tell me what happened . And he said , well , she danced around a bit , rubbed a titsamie face , and sucked me off . Which is what I asked her to do . It s so nice to be a disabled sex puppeteer . But even nicer than that , I used to have a preconceived notion on what I thought about people , such as prostitutes . But I was wrong . That woman treated him with dignity and respect , and made him feel like a sexual being for the only time in his life . And he can t put a price on that . All right ? Well , 180 , isn t it ? </s> <s> The exact figure . Then we go up front , and we go to call taxi . And the taxi driver who drove us there is still sitting out the front in his car . And he winds his window down and looks out and goes , I ll drive your home for free . I just need to know what happened . Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen . </s>"

        "transcript": "<s> New York is baffling and it s a city that prides itself on being an absolute shittiness . There s nothing good here and people are proud of that . Happy . Oh , it s overpriced and it s overpopulated and it stinks like piss and comics . Comics and film specials here and they all open with a joke about , yeah , they spend 8 , 000 a month for nine square feet and they go , why don t you fucking leave here ? Why do people stay here ? But unfortunately , this is where comedy works , where people are the most miserable . I d rather be filming a special on a beach in Costa Rica at a teaky bar right now , but they don t need comedians . They re already smiling . They re already happy , naturally . So that s why I m doing a special here because it s the last fucking place I want to be . What are these smoking through this whole set ? Because that s one of the loopholes in the law . They keep in the smoking bags . They keep , if it s part of a theatrical production , a loophole in the law because they don t want to fuck up some fatty Tennessee Williams production and ruin the integrity of the show . So they leave this fucking loophole open for me . If the cigarette bothers you because you re envious , vote next time . How about that ? Vote . Yeah . Every now and then . What s going on in your community ? No , you don t vote . You got shit to do . Leave it to old people with breathing problems who will never come here . This old fucking generation is so unbelievably sad . If you re just getting a party and age , you re fucked . There s nothing going on in this country anymore . It s done . Last call . It s just a suck generation . It s the most boring fucking generation in the history of people . I ll dumb down and want to know . When s the last time you heard stories about rock and roll bands , chucking TVs out of hotel windows or any of that ? Shit that it used to be fun . Like there was fun in the world . Some of this is going to make me sound like a grumpy old fucking I am . But I have just caused . There s nothing . As people get older , the older you get , the more bitch you get . Because that s just natural . The more you ve done shit , the more jaded you get . But I think we re going to be the first generation of old people . As soon as someone gets old , they complain about the new kids . Oh , these kids today . Look , they re crazy . </s> <s> It s always that the new , it used to be always that the new generation was too deviant . These kids are out of control . They re crazy . They re a mora . Look at what they re doing . In our day , if we wanted fun , we just went to a barn dance . We didn t even finger fuck to it . We were like 35 years older . But these kids today , it was always that the new generation was over the top . And we re going to be the first generation of elderly people complaining , but in the opposite fashion , where we re going , look at these kids today . These have faggots . We used to do cranks off of titty dances and shit . It was going to hurt . We had a lot of fun . We ve got some good stories and herpes out of the deal . It was a fucking good time . The blisters bring me back . These pussy s , they drink a red bowl for some pep . And they prefer if you went on the patio for a cigarette . The closest they come to a fist fight is on a message board somewhere . You looking at my girl , I m going to delete you from my my space friend . You ve got some block user in your future , faggots . Where about to start piss testing for adrenaline in the workplace ? That s how sad this country s getting . You re shaking your urine in front of you . Is that yours , Donnie ? It looks a little cloudy . Have you been having fun on the weekend ? Are we not enough fun for you here at the Verizon Wireless Family ? You need to seek it elsewhere ? I don t think you re a team player . That s why I love hearing no people go , oh , that town . It was like 20 years behind the times that looking place , booked me there . I had fun 20 years ago . I could still smoke indoors . I could , ecstasy , still pure , uncut and readily available . Oh , shit . What cavemen they must be . You only drugs that are even popular anymore . All the dummy drugs , all the drugs that make you more boring , all the moods , stable , eyes are antidepressant . Everyone s got some mental disorder they ve been diagnosed with and they take a pill . They push them on me all the time . I got ruined so many relationships because I think all the time . Sorry . Oh , geez . It s ADD . No , it s not ADD . I m thinking . I m thinking about a lot of stuff . It s not ADD . Yeah , I started online . I fucked . Stop up . But I m always thinking , well , you re not listening to me because I m thinking about something that s more interesting than you . I m trying to build a perfect utopian society in my head . </s> <s> What are you talking to me about ? Bowling or what ? I don t know . And I do . I have a head that just won t shut the fuck up . So what do you ideas come from ? Do you have a head like that ? Do you have the brain that just won t shut the fuck up all the time ? You learn to work with it . Do you ever try to do this ? I try this in July in Tucson , Arizona and failed miserably . Do you ever try to sleep sober ? I m trying to do that . That s completely impossible . I try . I ve got a meeting at 6 . 30 in the morning . I ve got a flight to LA for a meeting . So I m trying to be responsible . And I m just laying there to hotel . No people or conversation . No distractions . Sober . No television . Just your head on a pillow . One air . Two air . You bought them . Because that s when the carnival kicks in the high here . Bap , ba , ba , ba , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da . You re almost 40 years old . You fucking loser . How long are you going to do this ? How long are you just going to get drunk ? And I m used to sit ins for a living . Well , there must be something that rhymes with orange . Orange . Orange . Orange . Orange . As fucking music is playing in there . And it always sucked it . We didn t start to fire . Yeah . Shut the fuck up . I m going to go to bed . We were hours . You re going to sleep in my ex wife is in there . You never took me to the botanical garden . It was always about you . You fucking megalomaniac . You never get out of his diet of loneliness . It was always been a good time world . My turn . Shut the fuck up . You re going to sleep . Why am I not taking fucking medication for it ? That s also where the ideas come from . I ll just pour some alcohol on that one . It happens . Try to even it out . You work with your promise . Fucking everyone s taking pills . Because you re afraid of standing out . I was terrified when my doctor told me that I had a unique and interesting personality trait . But then he told me about New Zola , the Brozac . And I just take three pills a day . And I blend into this fucking horrible inbred corporate landscape . And I don t care . Oh , no ! No ! It s a . . . They ll legalize any drug so long as that drug keeps you producing . </s> <s> That s all I give a shit about is production . You re kicking out enough boxes at the plant ? Well , go . And whatever keeps you doing that keeps you vaguely content sitting in a cubicle . Go ahead and FDA approved . I have a job where I alphabetize insurance forms 45 hours a week . And I noticed I couldn t concentrate so well on my job . So my doctor put me on Adderall . And now I can just breeze through my work day . I don t even notice that my empty life is being pissed away underneath fluorescent tubes . I have no highs or lows . I have no good stories . But I m getting a lot of stuff done . I m probably the most boring person I know . But look at me . Produce , I just go ABCD , EFG , H I J K , I m gonna be . La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la . You re never gonna take a pill for that ? You re not concentrating because that s fucking boring . And that s a natural reaction to boring . Don t concentrate . Find another way . You re gonna make a living , you re bills to pay , buy less shit and find some sucka dick . You re gonna pay bills sucka dick . I m talking to you in particular . It s your close . Whatever . Spin around the brass pole a few times . Whatever . Say you saw the Virgin Mary in a grilled cheese sandwich and sell that shit on eBay . There s a grift in the system . There s always a scam . You don t have to do it just because your guidance counselor told you you d excel at it . Fuck them over . This country is so bereft of imagination anymore . So fucking those pills probably have a lot to do with . I was a real slut when I was a younger girl . I slept with a lot of guys . And it s not something that I m proud of . But I m in therapy now . And my therapist put me on well buterin and a fixer . And she explained to me through our sessions . The reason I was so promiscuous , I come from a military family . So I didn t have a stable male role model in my life . I have a low self esteem because I m a little bit chunky . And I try to compensate for that by having sex with a lot of different men . Maybe you just like the cock . Is that possible ? Is that possible ? That s why you slept the rack . You like that fucking purple meat hammer . There s a whaling in and out of your untrimmed , winter ready New York sludge pot . And that s fantastic . Take some cock . There s nothing wrong with it . Free fun . That s what it s there for . She don t take a pill . Take the cock . It s there for that . Maybe your clitoris is there for a reason . </s> <s> Huh , huh . Clips there to attract pork sausage . It s one equal right . You ll never get . You ll have every equal right in the world . And you ll women , not you specifically . Don t get over yourself . I m talking women will never have the same equal right as men do to just , you can t sling pussy without shame attached . You ll be Hillary Clinton s and you ll get equal pay . But you want to go fuck like this guy fucks on a weekend . He gets high fives . You get , whore . They have to keep some shame involved . I won t pick on you just because you re in the front . That doesn t matter . But I m making a point . And I know it sounds base or coarse . But the reason that you can t do that as women , pussy really is the main motivating factor in all of humankind . It really is . It s what gets shit built . I m not a good for pussy . I m not a , this is a flaw in the system . No clad for it . Say , that s the , they know that as a catalyst . And that s why religion and government have to control , supply , and demand of pussy . And they do that by heaping shame upon you . Should you want to give away more than the federally allocated recommended daily allowance outbussing ? Oh , she wants to suck more than one thing . Oh , shun your natural instinct . Or , or nothing will get built . Right up in the , you know that . It comes down to production . It really does . You know , they have to keep that pussy like a dangling carrot , something that s hard to get . So he keeps running on the treadmill , building up more shit , sending out more boxes to the dollar store , pointless shit , and no one needs . That s why cocaine is illegal . It makes pussy too easy to get . They can t have it . They re not having it . The pussy was suddenly easy to get . It d be worth simple for human beings to just relate to a regular level . If you could just lay down a big fat rail on the first date , and you gacking up 10 minutes later , your sucking is taking a 30 year old . You re loving every second of it . Yeah , no inhibition . If it were that easy , then you wouldn t have to spend 60 hours working in a factory and saving up your overtime check . So one day you can afford a spoiler for your Honda . It s going to attract a girl s attention , and then after a lengthy courting process , and you meet the parents inside the contract , maybe then one year on your birthday , she ll suck your dick in a broomcloth . </s> <s> Yeah . That feeling you got horn . Should have done the bump . That s not going to awful . It s just going to make sure you re produced . Bots , you don t need to come on diamonds , and fucking flowers . At least black people do when they wear slaves . You remain clueless . You re ashamed of it . Fucking get a lot of work done . Hard work is fine if it s a work of passion , but just a work hard to buy shit to impress people . You re fucking losing an empty vessel . Hard work , if it s hard work that you do for free , hard work if it s a work of passion , you re working to learn how to play the acoustic guitar . You re trying to find my prostate when we re on ecstasy or something . That s a work of passion . Sure , go . Dig in , root around . It s a work hard . All of them . You worked hard to get where you are . No , I didn t . I drank smoked and did drugs to get where I m at . I m really not glorifying shit . I ain t trying to build it up , but it really is responsible for where I am . I haven t ever tried very hard . I m here because I , you know , drugs expanded my imagination and made me think outside and your reality and cigarettes gave me the patience to sit and write those thoughts down in a comedy friendly format that you could understand . And the alcohol gives me the courage to stand up here in front of you judgmental bricks and build a quarter million dollars with the cameras in your face . Woo ! I didn t fucking work hard for this show . I am ill prepared . There are people here from the first show . And , you know , wow , that s a lot of different material . Yeah . Just membered . LAUGHTER Right ? I don t , I didn t want to try hard for this show because I didn t want to send the wrong message to the kids who might be watching at home . Oh , fuck it , work hard . Don t me you die at the end of anyone , tell you . Sorry . That s the alcohol . But it makes me funnier . That s why I m drinking . Ironically , I m drinking to be more professional because I m funnier when I m drunk . I really am . 17 years . I have AA friends that I ve had for lifelong friends that all of them have had to eventually cave in and admit that I m funnier when I m drunk . I m fucking killed . It s like they have to deny their own religion to admit it . They re like , all right , all right , you fucking . That was a good show . </s> <s> I know you re fucking ripped . Doug , you have a serious problem and you make jokes about it . That s how you deal with it . But I ve been in the program for a long time . If you ever want someone to talk to , but don t quit tonight , though . We have tickets for the late show . But , so . We ve seen you sober . It s a stuttering awkward wreck with no self confidence . But tomorrow , we d like to talk to me . I m up at 6 a . m . Fuck you . Fuck you . It s fucking a horrifying . Have a AA guy tell you to your face . He s supposed to be the know it all . And he tells you that your career is dependent on your disease . Kind of a scary proposition . It s like having your psychiatrist tell you that not only are the voices in your head real , but they re accurate as well . So I shouldn t kill the babysitter . I m afraid so . Yeah . I m more and more funny down my head . Pipe down . LAUGHTER Jesus died for your sins . I m doing it for your mere entertainment dollar . CHEERING That s far more admirable . Jesus never made you laugh . Never was . Never worked all week . Stacked and pants at the banana republic and whatever you do and rushed home on Friday night and dressed up to rummage through to Bible to see what crazy antics your slapstick savior was up to this week . We never made you laugh . He was a mythical , boring , unfunny fucking . I love you more . Now , watch me jack off . That s not even a regular tagline . Kind of detracts from the whole purpose of this joke . But why would you . . . I don t even understand the connection . Would die for your sins . What is . . . He died for your sins . Well , why doesn t one affect the other ? I fucking . . . I hit myself in a foot with a shovel for your mortgage . What ? No . I don t understand the . . . And if there is a correlation , why would you do that ? Why would you die for someone s sins ? Your sins are the only interesting thing about you dreary bleak mother fuckers . Your sins are one to make you fantastic . That s what keeps us great and exciting and fun . That s what makes you alive . Man , you should wear your sins on your sleeve . You should be trying to top your sins on a daily basis . When you go to work in the morning , the first thing out of your mouth tomorrow morning at work should be the dirtiest shit you did tonight , because that s what people want to hear . It makes you . . . Right ? You tell me a story , hypothetically . You tell me a story about what a good Christian kid you are and how that good book is filled you with some effervescent , loving light of Jesus that shines out of every pore in your squash . </s> <s> You re walking on sunshine because of the Lord . At the same time , you keep the story going real loud . At the same time , you tell me a story about that . One time , you kick fuck the girl with cerebral palsy . And we ll see who draws a crowd . Even if you re on a make believe , slapstick Jesus on a stick and have to walk away from you right now . Oh , that s very nice . I pray for you , too , but I really want to hear this . Start over . You did once . Was he into it ? Oh , my God . What kind of industrial lubricant do you . . . I can t believe I died for these stories . These stories are fascinating . LAUGHTER So , fucking silly . If you re Christian , you get cheesed off of the Jesus . I got too hating stuff to follow it . So , I mean , you are a shithead , but I can make you feel like you re not the only shithead . Fucking big blistering chunk of Jew hating coming right your way right now . LAUGHTER I wrote this budget Jew hating stuff . I didn t intend to . I was over in Scotland . Every year in August in Edinburgh , Scotland , they have the Fringe Festival . It s the biggest arts festival in the world . It s a whole month long , and I m there in August . And some jackass writer for the London Times , he s writing a story about anti Semitism at the Fringe . And they had found a review of mine from earlier in the festival , this anti Semitic guy , and where I had been quoted out of context . Like , oh , just a string of blurps . He says shocking things like blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . And one of the things I had said that he quoted was , I hate the Jews . LAUGHTER Which sounds anti Semitic . So all of a sudden , I get thrown into his little piece of literature . And I had said it . I had said it without question . But I had said it in a happy , fun loving , Jew hating way . There s no animosity . It wasn t even a bit of mine . It was just some aside when I was rambling about fucking Mel Gibson was in the news at that time . And I m rambling about him being called anti Semitic going , why is he getting so much press ? He s an actor who gives a fuck what he thinks . I need press . I hate the Jews . Give me press . And ironically , bang , bang , bang , bang . Bang on the door . It s a fucking funny story . If you ve known me , if you guys have known me for a while , I ve been doing this 17 years . </s> <s> And I could feel three CDs worth of just the Christian bashing alone I ve done over my career . I ve done Mormon bashing and Muslim bashing . I ll do more Scientology bashing . Once I have a stronger legal team . But it wasn t until this phone call that I realized I ve never done any Jew bashing in my whole career . All the religion bashing I ve done . I never fuck with the Jews . I m like , why ? How did they ever escape ? And they do . You don t win in religion bashing . And Jews never get fucked with because they don t have the aggressive recruiting policies that other religions do . They don t have billboards every 30 feet . And be a Jew or burning hell . Jew God is watching you . They re not banging on your fucking door with pamphlets . You wouldn t talk to you about Judaism . So they don t get shit for that . They don t get shit because they have that Holocaust sympathy . They can surf on for another 15 years until the last survivor dies or until history channel goes out of business . And the Jews , too , their credit . They don t have the history of atrocities that other religions have . They don t , because they fucking lost all the time . Sorry . But they re not like the Muslims in Catholics . I ve heard so many comics do it bits about this new Pope . Oh , isn t it scary ? This new Pope used to be a Nazi ? And he go , not when you look at that track record side by side . The Nazis versus the Catholic Church . The Nazis only lasted a dozen years and they got their ass handed to them . And I m high at . The Catholic Church has a far more prosperous and prestigious record of murder and torture and oppression and nonsense . Not to mention the kid fucking and they re still around and more popular than ever . I d be far more afraid to hear someone go , you know that new Nazi ? He used to be a Pope . No shit . I m fucking out of here . That guy s dangerous . Yeah . So fuck the Jews . That s what I m saying . I guess fuck the Jews . I m sorry . I never said it over the course of my career . But fuck the Jews . Just for being a religion at all , you re as complicit as the rest in the retardation of human intellectual progress . I fuck into . Fuck you . My brother s a Jew . My brother s a Jew and I fucking fucking fuck him too . I hate his guts for it . I m like , I m like , hey , hey , level , but fuck what do you think ? He converted because the only humorless cut in his life that would ever fuck him twice . He had to cave in and marry her . Because he s afraid to die alone , but he doesn t mind settling for less and now they re together in a passionless swamp of a relationship . </s> <s> And they teach their kids that shit . See , the parents wouldn t have him if he wasn t converted to Judaism because they re racist . And there s another reason to fuck the Jews . I don t like racist . Fuck you too . You re not good enough . You re not a Jew . Fuck you . Mostly I hate the Jews because they re wicked annoying . Can we agree on that ? Who wicked annoying ? Listen , of all the religions I ve been around , the Jews have a tendency to throw their Judaism into whatever conversation you re having , any topic , whatever , there s something . Well , that s funny because I m a Jew . Oh , I m a typical Jewish mother . And I think grew up Jewish . Well , my Jew family . Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew , Jew . That s all I got to say , Jew , Jew . What do you keep saying , Jew ? I m at an airport bar with you . I have to talk to you . What can you stop reminding me that you re a rational in every third sentence ? It s like people who are really into their astrological sign and they have to pitch that in a whatever conversation you re having to define them . That s funny . I m a Virgo . Here s my Virgo coming out again . You re going to have to excuse me . I m a bit of a perfectionist because I m a Virgo . No , it s because you re a douchebag and you ve been busting my balls all day . There s nothing to do with your astrological sign or some alignment of the stars . It s because you re a shithead and it s time for you to take individual responsibility for who you are . Don t act like if your parents had fucked a month earlier , you d be feeding me chili dogs and letting shit slide . You re an asshole . Be who you are . I m a Jew . We naturally carry a lot of guilt . It s a Jewish thing . No , it s a you thing . You that fucking in that chair . That s nothing to do with Judy . If you have guilt , maybe your weak of character , maybe you re fucking guilty of something . I don t know . Maybe you just stole that bottle of yagor out of my freezer and you re generally good . But it has nothing to do with some ancient tribe of blah , blah , blah . That s not attached to your DNA . Right ? By the same logic , we all come from apes . But I don t throw ape in every conversation . Use ape to define myself . Use ape as an excuse to defecate in my thumbless myth . I m sorry . Did I just splatter you with wet feces ? </s> <s> I m sorry . I am a very rich ape upbringing . Strong ape heritage . I m an ape . I m really worthless as an individual . Anybody who defines themselves solely on their race or religion or nationality , if that s the first thing out of your mouth , what are you all about ? If that s the first thing on your MySpace page , I raise an American book . I m like , is that ? You got nothing else . Community college and something else . But you use that fucking trivia because you got nothing to say . You useless . You kind of out of shit . Not in this set . I mean , I have some stuff I put on paper . But in the long term , I think I m out of shit . Fucking cannibalizing my own 17 years . What else do you have to say ? If I die soon , don t ever say I died too young . Every time an artist dies young , I only got nine more days before I m 40 . If I still have that three in front of my number , maybe they ll say I died young . If I had the four died early perhaps . Die not as late as he could have . But every time an artist dies young , Kurt Cobain or whatever , there s always the people . He s so sad . He had so much more to give . I don t even know . Maybe he was out of shit . How do you know ? He s gone . He got all the money . He did all the drugs . He fucked all your holes . And that s the American dream . And when you re done with that , you go , oh , that s why they call it a dream . It s bullshit . I m still empty . And he catched up . Maybe . How do you know what any artist had left ? How do you know if Jimmy Hendrix had not died ? He wouldn t have wound up doing Super Bowl halftime duets with Elk and John right now . You rock it , man . What ? What ? What ? You go , this is tragic . Why didn t that guy die ? He was right here . I don t want to see this . I m stuck in pathetic . I didn t know if Lenny Bruce hadn t had died . He wouldn t have wound up taking over Andy Rooney s spot at the end of 60 minutes . Just some crusty old con with Waiere Ibraz , bitching about ATM fees and a cluttered death . Maybe he s out of shit . We re back to nationalism . Nationalism does nothing but teach you how to hate people that you never met . All of a sudden you take pride in accomplishments .

I know we went through to Wendy s drive through . We re going to get one of them fresh sandwiches . It looks so alluring on the commercial , but then we ordered it and realized we had no money . We had to ditch out before the second window . We had to face bags in line behind us with the bass music . Probably got our order . We laughed about that , but I don t remember saving the French . I went through the last ten calls on my cell phone and there s nothing incoming or outgoing to the French looking for muscle on a project . I checked my pants .

And if that guy is as qualified for your job as you are , you re a fucking loser of such ethnic humiliating proportions . I would be ashamed to have anyone find out that guy took my job . He doesn t speak English . Did they do your job training in pantomime ? Shit , Ed . Oh , see , come on . Point , point . I see , point , point . Great , great , great , great . Oh , you re out of here , mullet head , hey guys , look what I m talking about . Fucking asshole , you should have tried harder . Nobody bitches about immigrants taking their job if that person has skills of any level . No , here fucking brain surgeon sitting around the Beverly Hills Hotel lounge . You know it really chaps my ass , Barry . Scandinavian fellows are coming over , taking all our good neurosurgery positions . The Norwegian specifically , and I say we down ourselves a bottle of Jack Daniels and go stop us and wegey ass , the first wegey we see . Jump out of that explorer , pound him . Fucking immigrants . All started with that Einstein . Once they brought him over from Germany and we didn t have any good genius jobs . It was a trickle down effect . Steel engine job . Hey , hey , hey . Fear , fear , fear , hey , hey . Fear , come on , they re taking your jobs and terrorists are trying to blow up your Ford Focus specifically . Yeah , you need to fucking , always my pure rel , I touch the door knob . There s a new fever or flu , there s a big , bang it sober , responsible , boring dull , hands anitizing generation and I can t get the germs up , I m afraid . I fucking think . I try to qualify , I use fangit too liberally , but I use it as a word of weakness . I attach no sexuality to the word and if you re gay and you re in here and you re offended , I ll be at the door in a way out and I ll suck your dick just to show . No offense , I m not gonna get wicked into it and you ain t got your balls , like your coat up and that s the only way you can come . </s> <s> I ll just pinch you with two fingers and . . . But just to show that I mean no disrespect , because it s too strong of a word to let go . Faggot is a good word . So you know , I got a little sore on my lip right there to match the one that broke out on my dick from this dress . Yeah , well you know what ? I was a player , not a fucking spectator in this life , honey . You look at a herpes , like a skateboarder looks at a skimmy when you play a lot of , ain t that big a fucking deal and I ain t that any anymore . I m an old man and I don t give a shit . Anyway , let s move on . I was trying to segue in the kid fucking , but segue is gone . Let s just jump right in , shall we ? Internet predators . Yeah , they re very popular all over the television . Like a catcher predator in my space , you know , fuck yeah . Like I don t know , because I was a kid at one point . I don t remember , but it is pictures . But I remember we didn t have the internet , but to avoid predators , our parents would go , hey , son , don t talk to strangers . Some of them might try to fuck you . And you go , oh thanks . Thanks for that heads up . And then you just went about your day . Does that not work for the internet now ? You don t have to parent anymore . Oh , the internet , like that was a crazy way of getting around that don t talk to strangers . The fuck , if you re a parent and you re in here , I know you don t want to hear this . You ll argue with me and you ll say that I m twisting the fag . I m wrong , but this is the truth . That probably , a huge probability . When I say probably astronomical odds , the biggest odd statistical probability , probably nobody wants to fuck your kid . I know you don t want to hear it . You want to think that child is so ultra fuckable that all the pedophiles there , they re jockeying for position right now down at the sea sauce . Waiting for him to come out of first period . Wait for it . Not that junky kid , the only old kid . That s why we re all here . If you wanted your kid to get fucked , just to prove to your neighbors and your dated community that your kids hotter than their kid , and you sent your kid out as bait , and you put him in a Catholic schoolgirl skirt with no underpants , and you made him hop on a pogo stick to school . </s> <s> So his little pink , fleshy hind quarters , shown so temptingly towards traffic . He would still probably graduate school having never been poomed , and then what an asshole you d look like trying to brag around a gated community at the next cocktail mixture . It s just by the grace of God that no one ever fucked him . It s only because of my hyper vigilance and the work of my congressman getting more laws passed on the internet that he never got fucked . If I were a parent , I would prefer that pedophiles be on the internet . There s no more pedophiles in the world than they ever have been . The act like the internet is creating pedophiles where there were none . If I were a parent , if you exist anyway , stay on the internet . Stay jacking off in your basement in South Carolina as opposed to the old fashioned way where they actually went down to your school yard . They did laps around a playground . Smarties on a fishing line trying to fly fish a little junior into the oldsmobile . Keep being on the internet . Just don t fuck the kid . That s what it s about , right ? Just don t fuck the kid . That s all you should be worrying about . But that s not what the attorney general says . His number one focus is to stop the kid fucking . He wants to go after the internet . He s not going to have to the guy with the kid in the camera . He s not going to use that fear mongering to get more government control in your life . More legislation . Oh no , I don t want to have to be responsible for my own kid . You take care of it , Mr . Government . And if I get tired of it , I ll just vote for the other party . And that ll make a difference . It s all about child pornography rampant on the internet . Have you seen it ? Attorney General , we need to stop the child pornography rampant on the internet . We need more government involvement . I ve never seen child pornography on the internet . But I ve seen every other type of thean grotesque , sometimes stimulating , always clever . Every other type of pornography that two eyeballs can absorb . You get into one good fruitless coquianque where you re all gacked up on blow and you re just beating off till the band plays . Because hookers won t answer their phone at this hour . You know , it s not going to work . You re not going to finish it . This is a cold dead eraser in your hand right now . You wake up , you re punching a face . You fucking wake up . Top to me . Wake when we bought this shit . You re waking up now . And you just start clicking on random porn links . You got pop ups everywhere . And that chick looks hot . Click on that and you go everywhere . Just keep seeing shit . </s> <s> It s never when it s advertised . 18 year old amateur hot co ed action . And then you click on it . And it s some fucking bondage enema porn . It s a fucking . . . The amputee porn . I see what Prego , Popper , fucking lactating , mom , all the flat top fucker . I mean , they all sound like funny shit . I mean , shit . I mean , shit . I make fun of midget porn . It s funny to say , but it s out there . It s like the comic relief porn . I look at after I just jacked off to something hugely uncomfortable . And I go , all right , well , let s go look at midget porn and laugh . Someone s into this . You gay , Tard . Look at that . But it s all out there . All this shit never saw someone fucking kid . I ve seen three old queers . Go to my website . On the forum on my website . Seriously . They have a thread called the tsunami of prune where all these guys just post the most disturbing picture to fuck with everyone out . Three old queers . Three old guys in their 70s . They look like any kind of , you know , feds wearing like insuriners , but now they re all naked . One second , the other one s dick and the other two are making out very passionately , which is more disturbing than even the blowjob as the other two silver haired , uh , it s like , uh , see that ? Never seen the child , but I ve seen cock fingering on the internet . I ve seen it several times randomly surfing porn , digit in the mail urethra , objects in the mail urethra . Seeing cock finger , I ve seen it several times , yet I ve still never managed to see someone fuck a child randomly . So if child pornography is rampant on the internet , cock fingering is probably occurring in this room as we speak . I have no children . If I had children , once people have kids , they get all fucking weak and they have that genetic defect that makes them want to protect but make other people like the government do it for them . I don t have a child . Maybe I d feel differently if I did . Well , would you have kids ? I don t know . I know I ve had an abortion with my wife and it s been five years probably now . I just want to say still a great decision . Every road be weighed anti abortion rally that comes out . Now find some fucking crying come from a trailer park and put her behind a podium and pat her back so she gets attention . Did you go any regretted to stay ? I had an abortion because I was in a lot of children and I wish I had that baby back and I would have been a child . </s> <s> We don t agree on much my wife and I but we agree that was the best decision we ever made . Still five year anniversary . Glad we fucking killed the baby . Five years later , still glad . Still happy . No guilt , no regret . Have a lot of regrets about how handled the relationships and the baby never brought up . Just say it . Casey , you ever come to that point where all regret it then ? We haven t . You don t hear that side of the story . I got this anti abortion flyer that was sticking them under . Everyone s a windshield wiper in the parking lot of this place in Texas . It had a picture of a dead fetus on the front . You know how the pro life folk are so fond of the dead fetus photo . They get a picture of an aborted fetus and they run home and they blow it up large on a record and they bring it down to their protest rally and they shove it and you have face at 9 . 30 in the morning . Don t you turn away . I m just going to the ATM . I m not going in this place . I m going to clean the sidewalk . The ATM hung over . You know where the bar is ? I think they do that . The idea is that that picture is supposed to be so disturbing and so disgusting that it will single handedly change your whole view of the abortion issue as though live child birth were really pretty to look at . When that living monster is actually ripping out of you . It s all covered in blood and mucus and sputum . You re screaming . Everybody screaming . Your husband s vomiting through a surgical mask while trying to maintain a comforting eye contact . Now you re snatched and asshole of Auburn torn into one big . Open septic manhole . Don t you turn away . You put a picture of that under my windshield . We re all frame it and put it over the piano . It s adorable . It s a little sweetheart . But this little peaceful freeze dried a borned fellow laying all night time on a comfy pillow next to a ruler . He s disgusting . Shame be that . Like I said , I ve had an abortion . I ve been party two in abortion . So , and we don t know what became of it . When we had an abortion , we just shuffled out the front door . We didn t tag its ear or keep in touch . Tracking on a GPS . The little pen pals know . If I can left . So if I see a picture of an aborted fetus , there s that party that s got a wonder a little bit . </s> <s> Steve , anything ? It s like the dog . Oh , there s a little bit . I think he s got my scowl . You ve had an abortion . It really makes the whole idea , the whole concept of heaven a lot more disconcerting if you ve had an abortion . As irrational or illogical as that idea is , it s still depressing to think about if there were a heaven . And you fought through the white light and got up to the pearly gates . That d be the first dead relative waiting for you there . All angry and pinch faced . Oh , no kushie . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , take your time , didn t you ? It s like you were having a lot of fun down there . You know , they took pictures of me . They took pictures of me . They d be next to a ruler for Christ s sake . Would you know my name ? So I get the flyer . It s got the dead fetus on the front . On the back of the thing , it s got the whole pro life propaganda screed . At the bottom , the guy who prints these things for a living , for fun or profit , or whatever his motivation is , he puts his name and phone number at the bottom in case you want to order more . And I m drunk with a phone . And the guy answers his phone . It s not even a business . There s no , it s a dude in rural Wisconsin . It s in his phone in the bedroom . And I want to fuck with him , but I want to be original . You don t want to just be drunk and trying to throw logic at this problem . We re just going to waste cell phone minutes . That s like trying to kick water uphill . So what I did is I came at him and I attacked him from the more conservative angle where I accused him of being the worst type of child pornography on this planet . This is sick . I can t believe what I m looking at . Sir , this is a child in this photograph . That s not a choice . That s a child . And for you to distribute photographs of naked children around my neighborhood , you re attracting the most deviant type of child predator on this planet . Right now , preach your necrophiliac child molesters are masturbating like frenzied apes and cages to your happy work . Sir , don t you do , do , do , do , do me . You knew what you were doing . You could have photoshopped a bikini onto that little baby . You could have airbrushed a tasteful one piece , but you chose not to . Because this is how you get your rocks off . And I hope you burn it out . Blank . I don t get here very often . I m glad I had the opportunity again . So I can close strong and say , fuck the Yankees . I want to close them . Fuck the Yankees . I love that . Fuck the Yankees . Fuck you and your Yankees . Fuck the Yankees . Yes . Fuck the Yankees for several reasons . You want to go through all of them . Fuck the Yankees . A , they bought their team . </s> <s> Yes , they bought their team . They spent the most money . They re supposed to win . If you have money on the Yankees , different story . If you have money on any team , okay , go ahead and cheer for that team . It s kind of like having stock in a company . You have an investment . You re cheering for that . But if you re just going to be some fucking blow headed alcoholic , drinking an over priced beer in the stands , paying too much money for parking , and they re going to yell for a team , have some character , and pick it underdog . If you re just yelling yell , pick it underdog . What on ? The Yankees is supposed to win . So for you to be a dildo arrogant fan on top of that , that s like going to a casino and cheering for the house . And being an asshole about it . We re here ! We re gonna sit up for the fucking Indian casino . Just set up shop right behind a blackjack table and go , oh , deal a bus , did you ask bitch , huh ? That s my fucking dealer . I chose that dealer . I got my dealer at all . I spent food money for this hat . I m hungry . The fuck is that ? Fuck the Yankees most . Because they re the reason that you have to go outside to smoke cigarettes . And the reason that they just banned trans fat and food , they re telling you how to eat in the city , how to live your life , what you can do on your own property . They re just banned , fuck it , they re trying to ban iPods and cross state supreme court in this state . Ten days ago , upheld a ban on dancing in nightclubs . Anybody know this ? Nightclubs . Not fucking Utah , not footloos . New York City ! Tough guys , aren t you ? The fuck is standing on like fucking bitches smoking outside . They tell you what , you can put in your food , what you can eat , where to dance , where to walk , you can t fucking use my cell phone , be either wheel of my car , but tough motherfucker . Before you advertise how tough you are , you might want to go into the bathroom and do some of Bloomberg s cock smell out of your assholes because it seems to me that you are just little bitches to City Hall . And that s what I say , fuck the Yankees too , because the Yankees , what you are all rallying around and getting pumped up and bad ass about when you should have been down at City Hall 60 , 000 you re getting fucking an amped up . Next time someone even mentions a smoking ban , it should have been 60 , 000 you prick , fucking booing and throwing batteries at the guy who suggested it . You ve been stack of motherfuckers . I m gonna go . See outside smoking . I m not chillin applause . This is where credits roll . It s got a part of the thing . I m rather than that there . </s> <s> Go and sit down and open up this . It s not real . They re lying . I like the one . Fuck the Yankees . Just sit quietly . It d be better credits than the audience would . That would be credits . That would be real for like 60 of my show . All right . Can I go around ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . </s>"

        "transcript": "<s> yo said please welcome Christopher Titus Hello , everyone . Hello . Hello . Hello . Thank you . Thank you . What s up , bitches ? Thank you . Very nice . Very nice . Very nice . Well , August 25 , 2001 , my wife gave birth to our first child . Thank you . Then September 11 , 2001 , I realized how bad my timing sucks . And the five years my kids have been alive all hell has broken loose on the planet Earth . And I m not blaming my daughter for all of it . I m hoping it s a coincidence . Terrorism , war , diseases we can t cure hurricanes , tsunami , spin it , fucking France . It s the end of the world , people . It s an Armageddon checklist . Pope John Paul didn t die . He pre bording . And if you have kids , you re scared . I have kids , man . Every night , the news tell me little kids are getting stoned out the street like carsteroes out of convertibles . And I got two . I don t know what to do . I bought a rot wiler , stapling them both to until they re 18 . There you go . Shut up . Daddy says ride the dog . We got new diseases every week . Do you even remember diseases before 9 11 ? Since 9 11 , SARS , monkey pots , which both my kids think are a sugary breakfast cereal . Mad cow disease . I got to be afraid of fucking cows now . And Canadian cows , I feel like such a pus . Yeah . When did it become Lions , Entigers , and cows ? Oh my . Did we get the bird flu , the hunt of virus , the mosquito virus ? Did the animal kingdom have a meeting ? All right , who s tired of being food and clothing ? Anybody else ? Cow s , get on it . Woo ! Cow was mad . And our priorities are all screwed up . Five years , we still can t go catch some of Ben Laden . But in those five years , we nailed Martha Stewart and Barry Bond s ass to the wall . The world s worst terrorist is still dragging his dialysis machines for a Pakistani strip mall right now . But the Dolly Bition , the slugger prick won t bother us again . Prince Charles married Mick Jagger . What s going on ? And things are so screwed up , we re accepting stuff that we shouldn t accept . Do you guys hear this ? The anti depressant Paxle causes suicide in a lot of people . Let me say that shit again . The anti depressant Paxle causes suicide . So if you re depressed , you take a Paxle , you re going to feel a lot better and then blow your brains out . But the suicide note will be inspiring . All little eyes , dotted with little hearts , you know . </s> <s> Goodbye . Happy faces and the oes . Spinach is deadly . Poppies are lying prick . It s the end of the world . I wish people are getting shot . Nobody who turns their own butter should have a bullet in them . How you doing there , Zikio ? Pretty good , Jebediah . Smells like a drive by . And now it s been 400 billion on a war to help Iraq and Iraq . I mean , so appreciative , don t they ? How do you explain that to your kids ? Well , honey , some cultures won t get into some people with a Pinto mean thanks for the freedom . 400 billion . We call one guy . Could we just sense a gama , mad cow burger and a Paxle have been done with it ? Like oes , three . Oh , no ! 400 billion . We didn t spend that money here , except you can t trust anybody here either . Two weeks ago , in Los Angeles at a stop sign , I was asked for a dollar by a homeless 22 year old Vietnam veteran . It s like , yeah , man , here s the buck . I know . Denang was wack . And then he skateboarded off . It s the end of the world . You guys realize that when you have kids , that you re going to teach your kids stuff we never had to learn ? Don t over the mail . It could have anthrax . Don t talk to the mail man because he needs Xannex . And don t go any building with four stories high because I m eating him . Oh , my crash is 747 and doing it . My daughter s five . Now , she s asking me questions . I don t know what to tell her , honey . I don t know . I don t know why two poppin did 10 years still put out better rounds in Justin Timberlake . I don t know . What ? What ? Why is there a war ? You know , you re a go you re eating your own poop . What are you talking about ? Okay , this one right here . This one s because we proved that there was weapons , a master s job . Okay , this war s cut we proved that the Saddam was directly connected to 9 11 . Well , at least it only lasted six months . I m here . Gasping to get cheap pretty effing fast . You guys get that , right ? Our president is a Texas oil man and we re paying 3 a gallon . We re fucking retarded . I m sorry . And my daughter s too smart . She gets it watching . She gets it . She gets it . I have a smart kid . I don t want a smart kid . She keeps just a bring her down . I knew she was smart when she was one though because she would not watch reality television . She s leave , just leave . She s smarter than me . I watch reality television . Oh my god . The human drama unfolding live in front of me that some producers set up . She just sees people eating bugs for money and something she got her ass beat for two days earlier . </s> <s> Reality television is the end of the world people . Fear factors in syndication . We re rewatching people eat the same damn bug . People wonder why our kids are getting fat . Well , maybe it s because we re all sitting on our asses on the couch at home watching other people play cards on television . We can t even play cards ourselves anymore . Yes , I ve cut the deck but I don t want to reach my target heart rate . I ve got a heart that s a convicted felon and they gave her another television job . What s next ? Is Scott Peterson fishing our ? Oh ! Oh ! And of the world , the husbands and wives killing each other . My god , it s happening all the time . A guy a couple months ago shot his wife at a domestic violence center . I think they need to clarify the sign . Ministers wife shot him in the back with a shotgun . I guess he does work in mysterious way . Guy in Utah killed his wife . Guy named Mark Hacking stabbed his wife . By the way , ladies little tip , don t marry a guy named Hacking . Or stab her mixed shoot . He also a bad name . And it s happening all the time . We thought OJ was a fluke . Turns out OJ was a trend sitter . I ll come over here . Peterson , Robert Blake , who got off on the I couldn t have shot her . I left my gun in the restaurant defense . Was the jury in the jury box with just big helmet on ? Innocent . I believe in it . Oh ! In my final submission , I was taking OJ . And I get it . We ve all been in long term relationships . And we ve all thought about killing the other person . Just for a second , he was on the stairs in front of you . And you were like , aww . Aw ! Aw ! No , I m good . Go ahead . I know me . My wife s thought about killing me a lot . But she always turns the car around and takes the shovels and plastic sheeting back to home deep up . Who amongst us can say they have not bought the concrete to weigh down the body ? Who ? But you didn t use it . You went home , you come down , you fixed the driveway . And it s bad enough these guys killed their spouses . Isn t it worse the lawyers ? These lawyers are amazing . Peterson s lawyer was brilliant . This guy , Scott , was not trying to escape into Mexico . Oh ! Really , counselor ? Then why d he look like the Hispanic M N ? Well , he was in a pool too long . Who s he hanging out with ? Aqua , man ? Because I ve been in the pool 10 weeks straight . </s> <s> My hair never went clear . Wasn t going to Mexico , sure they caught him on the border . Ten grand on this pocket , English Pandace dictionary , and this pocket wearing a sorope and holding a leaf blower . And here s why I bring it up . Because the media , the viper media , just grab onto anything and just stoop it and beat us to death with it . And the thing is that you re just watching TV but your kids are sitting out with you . And Nese is a nephew . And at the end of the Peterson s from my daughter , she turns to me and she goes , Are you going to kill mommy ? Honey , that s up to mommy , isn t it ? Funny to me . Our media s out of control . And everyones always something stupid . The Terry Shiloh thing was nuts and it was on TV for 14 years or whatever the hell that one . My daughter turned to me in the middle of it and she goes , Daddy , rich woman with this woman of wild honey , she s brain dead . Her brain doesn t work anymore . You mean like Uncle Rudy ? No honey , Uncle Rudy s on Thorizine and Paxle and Marijuana and Merlot . I am so glad our government is finally decided to get directly involved in our family business . And the Terry Shiloh thing pissed me off because it was predicated on one thing . There wasn t enough witnesses to what Terry wanted . So as my 300 witnesses tonight , let s be very clear . If I am ever brain dead , kill Titus . If I cannot be told a fluids spewing out of my own or offices , please kill Titus . If I m not aware that s Pickwick Divers , I would like to be changed into , For God s sake , kill Titus . Unless , I m really funny . You know what I m saying ? Honestly . If I m lying there , And you guys enjoy that , God bless you . Film a movie , dress me as a Viking , I don t care . And you know why I don t care ? Because I m brain dead . And then when you re done laughing at me , kill Titus . And don t let me die slow and horrible by pulling my feeding tube . I want you guys to duct tape my ass to a motorcycle and let s break evil conoevo s jump record . That s right . I want to go out big . I want to be brain dead over the snake river canyon . Ring ring . And please film it . So my family can make some money off the DVD . Which I would like to be called Kill Titus . With 30 minutes of bonus footage . Made you giggle like a girl there . Our government has lost some money . You and our government went back to work on Easter Sunday to deal with the Terry Shiver debacle . </s> <s> And what happened to our government , man ? And our president , by the way , like him or hate him , you have to make president bush as at the toughest presidency since Lincoln . This man has got to open the paper every day and just go , fuck ! There was a hurricane . Cancel my spinach salad . And my trip to Amish country . And throughout history , great hardship has created great leadership . In this man s case , it s created a special Olympics honorable mention . I m sorry . No . You know your president s in bad shape when the only way to take attention off of him in five years is to have the vice president shoot a buddy in the face . Hey , Paul , you re gonna have to take him for the team . And he keeps talking about the moon . Here s a freaking mat light . He keeps talking about the moon . Just bringing up the moon every once in a while . And he s trying to lie behind the moon program . What the hell was he talking about ? And he keeps bringing it . And I keep , my first thought was , oh my god , he forgot we were hard to win to the moon . Like , things are just going so bad in Iraq . He looked at the window one day . I want to go there . I don t like it here no more . It s really hard here . Did you read the paper ? So it turns out we got to go to the moon because we got to go to Mars . We got to go to Mars . We spent 3 billion on this radio , Shaq , remote control car that we landed on Mars . And while it was scooting around it discovered , here , mud . Because I guess there s a mud shortage coming . We re just frankly not ready for . It s nice to know we ever need dirt and water mixed together . It s just a hop skipping a billion miles away . And he wants to put a colony on the moon . Cool idea , calling that a moon ? Of course , how are we gonna get there , dude ? Space shuttle . We ve blown up two out of ten now . The last one that worked , the gas gauge was broken . Yeah , how does it feel to be that astronaut ? You already know they ve blown up two . It s your big shot . You re on the launch pad . You re ready to go . You look down . Oh , Houston , we got a problem up here . Yeah , I flicked it . No , no , no , jiggle a while in my ass . Open a hatch right now . I will take a 71 vega to the moon for our get a damn space shuttle . You guys know , I found this myself . The space shuttle is actually designed in 1971 . You know what that means ? It s in the space shuttle . There s an avocado refrigerator and one duty brother s eight tracks . </s> <s> But that shag carpet looks bitching at zero G , doesn t it ? 1971 ? Isn t it time to crack the R D book on the shuttle ? You know why ? Because I have a shampoo in my house right now that fixes my hair on a molecular level . A razor with four blades . If I move too fast , we ll cut my head off . Can we please give the shuttle a little nip and tuck ? It goes 12 , 000 miles an hour . My bathroom and home goes zero miles an hour . Yet tiles fall off eight . There s anybody here want to be an astronaut if the emergency we parakeet on the shuttle is grout and a cocking gun ? I m having a problem with the stabilizer . I got it . I think it s like Google run NASA , man . If Google run NASA , we re just going to work . It s time for NASA to step up or step aside . Now I believe that . My dad just said all the time . Step up or step aside . You don t get the bitch unless you re willing to do something about it . Yeah , of course . My dad always said that while he was sitting on his ass on the couch drinking a beer . Y all in the me for not mowing the lawn . Wants you to step up and mow it . Ow ! That was a cigarette . Now I m a pirate . Arrrggg . But anyway , why are we going to space ? Anybody know what the hell are we doing in space ? We got pang , we got velcro , moving off . But didn t we already kick spaces ass in the 60s ? We landed a thing on the moon planet of flag on the moon , claim the moon for America . Not a shot fired . Hold up , hold up , not a shot fired . We re Americans . That confuses the bitches us all . Don t get me wrong , we ll take your land . But we need to kick somebody s ass first . See , that s why I think our space program screwed up . I say you want to fix a space program , we need to enemy on the moon . We invented one in Iraq , let s invent one on the moon . Oh ! Personally , I would like to send the French . And by the way , I m not just jumping on the I hate France bandwagon . I mean , I tried to jump on , but it was full . Who said bad the French are ? The European Union is trying to come together as one trading block . French is the only country that wouldn t sign the agreement . They were like , no , we will not sign a piece of pepper . We do not play with others well . Look at my asses , I walk away from you . All right , fine , fine , France . You don t want to play in our sandbox , you don t want to be on our team , fine , moons , all yours . </s> <s> They still hate us though , given the moon , they ll be living up there . Well , thank you for the moon , dumbass Americans . Look at the Americans , how they think they re so cool down there . With their hot dogs and their amber gills . Wearing their t shirt the other one . But we have the moon now . We could be on them from right here . You know , does that look like a laser to you ? Yep , ass a laser . And you better get some long sleeves on because it s going to hurt . Face it , we are a warring people . This country hasn t gotten better economically or technologically , unless we were kicking somebody s ass . And you know what ? It s made us the strongest damn country on the planet Earth . Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! But it s also caused some internal problems . Because some of those people we jacked up live here now . And because I got these two kids , I m trying to make the world better . I m trying to figure it out . Man , how do we make it better ? I can t figure it out . How come we re all the same biologically ? None of us can get along . I started out basic . I tried to figure out white people and black people don t get along . Sometimes . Turns out the problem is , who s the fucking white people , man ? I read some books , man . We can be dicks , man . Wow . Now , we need meetings like whitey and non or something , man . Because I read a thousand years of history and frankly , I m ashamed to call myself a pecker wood . I don t tell people I m white anymore . I m now binocampodian . And I hear this a lot , especially in California . Oh , there s no racism anymore . Really ? Okay , then let me ask you a question , white people and black people . If you re telling a joke and the group of people you re telling the joke to are the exact same colors you , you just set that joke fly no matter what it is , right ? But if one person in that group happens to be a photo negative of the rest of you . You got to run that joke to some filters , don t you ? Am I going to make the man feel there ? Am I going to get punched in the face , filter ? Is that the guy holding a Glock 9 , filter ? And your timing s off jokes not funny anymore . Are white people listening up ? I found this in my studies . There are white people jokes . I know . And ladies and gentlemen , these jokes are harsh . I know that because none of my black friends would tell me any of them . And I ll back . </s> <s> Come on , just give me one . Oh , man , you don t want to hear it really . I sign the waiver legally . I can t tell you the joke . You know , those jokes are so harsh and so funny , because they had 400 years to write those jokes . And here s the problem right now . The problem you might be in the lab bill right now , and it s on white people s side . Every white person in our country knows what our ancestors did . We know how wrong , horrible , vicious , and brutal it was . And the thing is what happened is just so outrageous . Frankly , none of us know what to say about it , man . How do you apologize for a 400 year faux pas like that ? Oops . My bad , just doesn t cover it . My black friends bring up slavery . I can t even talk , man . Oh , oh , oh , oh . Oh , oh , oh , oh . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Oh , I can t . Yeah . Oh , oh , oh . Oh , oh , oh . You guys know I wasn t there , right ? Come on , let s go shoot some hoop . Not that you re pretty supposed to shoot hoop . Oh , god , don t beat me up . Please don t beat me up . A lot of white people are afraid they re going to have to write a really big check . But I did some research . I found a lot of black leaders have said they didn t care about reparations as much as they wish somebody . Anybody ? Would you step up and make a formal apology ? That s fair , isn t it ? And I believe one man can make a difference . That if one man took 100 responsibility to healing could start . Go . Dude , there s some people right behind you , man . Come on . All right , whitey , I got it . Good evening , black people . First of all , may I say you re right , you do dance better than us . Put on the other hand , I also love chicken . Now that we have found some common ground . I said , I apologize , slavery was all my fault . Stupid , stupid , stupid . I thought it was going to be a fun trip . We re going to Africa . Woo hoo ! But all we brought was beer and no women . So when we got there , we were just hungover and pissed off and then all hell broke loose . I apologize . We should have just brought back plants . But we had this country to build . And we needed some help . We could have used Indians to help us . We could have used Indians to help us . But we killed them . To the Indian people . I also love whiskey . And hate trash on the freeway . And I apologize . But white people we get fired up , man , we re coming from England . We re free ! We re going to our religion . We re going to this new country . There s nobody there . We re the fuck standing on the beach with a feather in his hair . </s> <s> Who s that guy ? Hold up , hold up . He s wearing a loincloth smoke and a pipe . He s probably high . No , no , let him keep smoking . Because then he won t care if we take his whole country , idiot . Sorry . Indians . They re not going to be able to do that . They re not going to be able to do that . They re not going to be able to do that . They re not going to be able to do that . They re not going to be able to do that . Sorry . Indians , we didn t mean for it to go down the way it did for us . It was like going to a party in high school at someone s house and their parents ran out of town . We didn t mean to trash the place . But the football team was doing crystal meth . And Indians , I promise to make it up to you by at least once a year , losing 1 , 000 in your lovely casinos . Huh ? Yes . We could all do our part . And Indians , why do we take your whole country ? My God , we took everything , man . We could at least left it Texas . I mean , hell , we cleaned out all the Mexicans . I m in hell . We cleaned out all the Mexicans . I m in hell . I m in hell . Better Los Mexicans . I m in hell . Mooie . Apologiso . I didn t know what the hell we re fighting so hard for Texas for anyway . Anyone here who s been to Texas ? Texas is a hell , oh man . Dirt , cactus , lizards , dirt , cactus , the bush family , dirt , cactus , lizards . Come on . Hey . Hey . Hey . It s not like we were fighting for Colorado . Again , Indians . Really sorry about Colorado . Okay , I want to roll who else to the Japanese . You know about the A bomb and the internment camps ? The fuck that ? You guys started that , man . Hey . Hey . We were chilling in Hawaii in all hell , broclubs . I will admit , I overreacting . But look at you now , huh , with the plasma TV in a Toyota Prius , huh ? Huh ? Huh ? I think somebody deserves a thank you . You re welcome . So to every race of people in here tonight that Whitey has jacked up , I sincerely apologize for taking your land for the abuse for the same . I apologize for the land for the abuse for the torture for the smallpox blanket for the Jim Crow laws black people . I apologize for Kramer . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . </s> <s> Zach , you know what ? We re going to change the world tonight for our kids and their kids . On three , I want every white person this audience to say , I m whitey ! And I apologize . One , two , three . I m whitey ! And I apologize . I m going to cry . That was beautiful , man . That was great . Woo ! That was that was scene . We cracked the door a little bit . This is beautiful . And by the way , if you re not white , you should probably accept our apology because , did you see how fast we got organized ? There s a hell out of me , too , man . Because all we really need is two beers and an idea . I wrote that big because I have kids now . And by the way , I didn t give a flying rat s ass about this world before I had kids . I just wrote jokes , jokes like this . Hey , did you get your doctor , Adkins died , slipped on some ice , hit his head , died on life support . The man in the event of the All Meet Diet , died of vegetable . That s a damn good joke . That jokes like a mini man reliable , not inspiring . And then I had these kids , and I remember waking up one day and kind of coming to wear the fact that my daughter is learning her colors from the terrorist alert rainbow . Oh no , she thinks Winnie the Pooh is a medium threat . Comes in every morning for a briefing now . Daddy , what s today ? Well , it s an Alamo day , honey . Get your little pink bulletproof Barbie Kevlar vest on your Scooby Doo gas mask . What s up ? Where is your my pretty pony duct head ? Get it , dammit . This isn t a game . And by the way , I m not kidding . That color truck thing screwed my daughter up . She s a little kid . She s learning . Honey , what color is that ? Elevated . I shouldn t have had kids . I admit that freely . I m a retard . I shouldn t have had a man . I shouldn t have had a Because before I had kids , I was that guy in the airplane just hated him . You know , you know , you got your kid with screaming . Excuse me , sturdist . Those little pillows fit directly over a three year old fake . Oh , he s a little angel now . And you look at him . Same color blue as the sea . Really ? Were you who in that one ? Why don t you just go watch Lifetime ? And then I had someone . And I just , they love him and they re great , but man , it s just , you know , and your first kid for a guy is amazing . Your first kid is like your first car . You love it . You can t believe you have it , but you re going to put some dance in it . The child s service does like when they find that your baby has bondo covering a dang . </s> <s> Shut up , honey . If I keep standing ahead and get around again , just shut up . I did not drop her . I don t believe that sleeping with somebody qualifies you to be a parent . Because he balled into Walmart , right ? You know ? And you see those little bastards running around like you can think as I want to punch his father in the throat . Those are my kids . I m not good , man . I believe you want a child in this society right now . You should have to go to a parenting class before you have one . Or if I could have rented a midget for like two years . You know , just rent a midget , dress them up as a baby , had them walk me through everything , you know ? I pay some good midget money too . I ll be slipping up . Hey , midgets get screwed over in America every day . You ever seen them working at the mall , no ? Because all the counters are that high . What s the midget going to do ? There are no Starbucks midgets . You ever seen it ? Can I get you a latte ? I was doing a show for Comedy Central last year and then we had some actresses in a . . . I never care I m going to midget . So I m on the radio when they re talking about it . And I keep saying the word midget and this angry midget calls in because they all are . Well , they live at ass level , I think you would be too . So he calls in , he calls in , and he says , mad , and he goes , hey , well he said , hey ! Saying the word midget is like saying the N word . Is it really ? I don t know , because I don t remember time in our nation s history . We took a bunch of boats to Munchkin land . Fill them to the top with midgets . Brought them back and made a pic cotton for 400 years . Although cotton s only that high , so it s a much better idea , frankly . That s right , that s the right response , hell yeah . Yes , you guys win , and then you say , wait , we re being pussy s . Ha ha ! I m by the way , if there s any midgets in the audience tonight , I m whitey and I apologize . I m not good , man , I m not good . I knew I was good at kids very much from my wife gave birth . I was hanging on a buddy s chip , but his dad s house was building some hot rods . And we have his 10 month old son Brock with us . And Brock isn t that little walker thing they give him , but he doesn t have wheels on it , it s got balls on it . Is that the best way to teach a child how to walk ? Because by the way , Brock is seven now , it looks like he s hammered all the time . So we re working on the collar , checking on Brock . </s> <s> We re working on the collar , checking on Brock . We re working on the collar , checking on Brock . And we re checking on him every 8 10 minutes . How much trouble can it get into an 8 10 minutes ? I know now , alright ? And some people build their houses on hills , and it s not my fault . So we re working on the collar , checking on Brock . We re going to the collar , in the middle of working on the collar , we hear this noise . And on top of that noise , best I can describe is a terrified cooing . And we both look up , and Brock had found the garage door a moment before , and it s now going on this 100 foot driveway at about 35 miles an hour . Now , little walker thing is just spinning , man . And you can tell when the look on Brock takes every time he came around , that was not intentional . And some people put gravel at the end of their driveway , and it s not my fault . Those little balls hit the gravel , which stopped them really fast , man . Like against the laws of physics fast . And as they say at NASA , Brock was launched . And you can tell from the trajectory that reentry was going to be trouble . Because he had the gravel just balled up and when he stopped man , looked like someone rolled him in chocolate chips . I know ! And chip , when I turned to each other , I went , here s what happened . And I didn t learn anything from that incident . When I thought it was four months old , I started throwing them there in catchin her . Because by the way , ladies , every guy you meet will do this because we don t know what to do with something this small . Small than a bread box , not remote control . I must be able to throw it . So I throw in my catchin , she go , and I never thinkin she loves it . So I just start winging it . I m raising an ex games baby . Her nickname , Hang Time . And this goes on for like 10 11 months . Not sure getting language pretty good . And we had a dinner party at my house , all my friends , oh , and I want to show my friends how cool my kid is . Because well , she s a sur this a lay baby now . I pick her up , I go , I got it , I got it , I got it . And when I catch her , she looks right in my face and front of all my friends and goes , no , like that ! She s talking very well , isn t she ? I had been terrorizing her for like a year , man . </s> <s> A midget would have said something . Oh , I got two kids , I got two and a half of your boy , five of your girl . My little boy , you know , he s , I don t like him much yet . Well , I made him smile a couple times , but I m funnier than that . And if I m paying your rent and feeding you , I m the funniest son bitch in that house . This how you wake up . You killed him , dad . It s time when I can t take it . You re going to make me pee . Oh , wait , I m already pee . Sorry , it s okay , go ahead . Now , he s going , I think my daughter s five , and they re very cool , man , because at that age , two to five is magical . Where they can just say everything they hear , they suck it in , they say it exactly how you said it to them . It s amazing . And , kind of like living with the witness for the prosecution , man . We had a little incident . Our first incident happened when my daughter was 18 months old . I had to take her for the day , because it d been 18 months , and my wife needed a shower . She was getting kind of funky , lady . I ll admit that . So , you got the kid , I got the kid in the car , and I m by myself . I don t know what I m doing , I m just driving . And we had a little road rage incident , not my fault . Shut up , lady , you don t know me . Guy cut me off , man , I catch up . All right , man , it s on ! And from the backseat , it s on ! But no real damage done , right ? Except , I m a new dad , I m still my old punk yourself . I don t let the guy go . I start chasing him down the freeway . What a dick ! What a dick ! Now I gotta take her home to her mother , and there s no duck taping the car . So , I went to the wall greens and got some benedrill . Oh , no ! Oh , no ! No ! No ! The 7 babysitter ! Oh , man , I walked in the house a couple hours later . She was great , I don t want your bitching about all the time . She didn t make a noise . Why are you whispering ? She s not gonna wake up for a while . And when she does , she s gonna know some new words . But some good ones too , like adult and dosage . She is so precious when she sleeps with her eyes open like that . So I could have went with that one pretty clean . Three months later , my wife asked me to take her out again because she needs another shower . How many showers does this woman freak a need ? </s> <s> So I got the kid in the car and we re driving and we have another road rage incident , not my fault . But I see a pattern . Guy cuts me up . I slam on the brakes , you know , and I slam against my seatbelt . She jams against her 48 point harness . But I m a good daddy , I learn my lesson , I don t do anything . I just go , pshhh ! From the back seat . Son of a bitch ! We re gonna have a little talk with mommy and we get home . It s on , that s right , it s on . Hell yeah . Hell yes , it s on . It is out . She s cool , man . Both my kids fiercely independent . At 13 months , they both decided they could handle their own lives . Maybe because I m their dad , they re like , dad , I got it . My boy s like , I don t need you to feed me , give me this fork . Ding , ding , ding , ding , ding . Then child services comes over , I m like , he did it . I m like , dad , man , when she hit three , you couldn t get near my dad . I take off my all clothes , I take off my all clothes . Okay , huh , but taking up a long seat , turned like sweater to a three year old , is like space travel to us , big people . But here s what I learned , let them do it . So I just back up , let her do it , but I m time timer . 22 seconds in , sweaters wrapped around her head four times . She got one eye shown , but it s rolling back due to lack of oxygen . Now the sweaters over her face , she can t see , so she starts the panic and starts running down the hallway to her bedroom . But she can t see , so she s bouncing off the walls in furniture . And I really want to help her , but I m laughing so hard I can barely stand out . And she goes into her bedroom , where her grandmother happens to be sitting with the little one , and the rocking chair , she finally gives a sweater off , goes , Son of a bitch ! And grandma s looking at me like , it s all . He s so smart . She used it in context . That s an idiot , man . I m not good . You women , you guys are good with them . You re good with them .

The lawns look like Crapson s a midget left . Pick it up ! So from day one , man , day one got my computer home in the hospital . I d get it every morning and try teaching her , you know . Get in front of the TV and talk to her . Never baby talk to her . Parents talk to baby talk to her that kids crack me up . Because you re teaching your child a language ? Nobody knows . So when it s fine to go , aw , how come your kids retarded ? I taught him that . So we d give everyone a watch scene and hey , baby , look at CNN . Look at that 12 blitzer , uh huh , and that s a two pay . Oh , look , Lady Newscaster . She s Black , Asian , Latino , and the woman .

And he s got the top of his arm blown off . And both of his eyes got blown out in Iraq . And sending it to the wheelchair , and Sergeant Pepper s pregnant wife . Yeah . And one of the guys goes , Sergeant Pepper , comedian Christopher Titus standing right here . He seems to be hilarious . And Sergeant Pepper turns and goes , Titus ! Dude , your show rocked . And I want you to know me and my guys appreciate you coming all the way over here and performing for us . I cannot tell you what it means to us . Thank you . You re welcome . And I know what to say . And I m pretty good at finding funny and a dark place . I have no fear of that . But I had nothing , man . I m just a douche . I don t know what to do . And it just is weird silence . And then one of the guys saved me . He goes , Sergeant Pepper , who d you like a picture of ? You re in Mr . Titus ! And Sergeant Pepper turns his head and goes , who the hell s to picture for ? And dude , I m on the floor rolling on the grass laughing . And the dude was making fun of himself , and after all this stuff , and I am out . . . And my first thought was , my God , is that who we sent over there ? Is that the kind of heart and courage these kids have ? Because if that s the case , world s not coming to an end right now . And I had some hope . And I went home and let my wife give birth to our first child for the second time . And I started watching CNN with it again . Hey , look at CNN again , look at that . Yeah , yeah , look at that . It s a park . And there s a white guy and a black guy and an Asian guy and a Latino guy . And , okay , that guy , he s Canadian . Don t worry about him . They never affect the world much at all . But you see what they re doing , huh ? That s called praying . And they re doing it for each other . Your dad , he s never seen this in his lifetime . Maybe I was wrong . Maybe this is the best time to be born because that right there , that s what it means to be an American . </s> <s> And they re praying for peace . And we can have peace . And we destroy the people who screwed up the peace . So we can have some damn peace . I m going to teach you how to pray . We re going to go to church . Oh , wait , we can t . You might get fondled . Oh , no . Now , you re a girl . You re safe . What is going on ? End of the world . Guys , supposed to lead us to glory . Do it on their hands on little kids pants . One is up . One priest in Boston . One dude . Messed with over 100 kids . 100 kids , yo , father , growth beets . Not an Olympic event . How sick is that , dude ? He s up there on Sunday preaching . He s looking at , ooh , his vestments are tight . He s swinging that smokey thing , shaking it . I don t know what the smokey thing is called . Don t you think if your Jones and for a boy scout , you have an altar boy monkey on your back ? You should find a way to stop , man . Go to the home depot . Get a slight channel . F . Kill the urge . I feel bad for these priests . You know what I wish they had ? I wish they had , oh , I wish they had like a god to pray to for guidance . Or maybe like a book with some rules in it they could read . You re here . And don t misunderstand me . I believe in God . I look at my two kids and I know there s something . I was married 15 years . God exists . I survived three years on the Fox network . I was like , oh , yeah . But I don t trust the church anymore and that s sad . Because they ve done good work in the past . They fed the hungry . They ve helped the homeless when it comes to raping little kids . They ve dropped them all . How do we help the church get their respect back ? I have a plan . Pet afar crucifixions . Hey , hey . It s their idea . We re just going old school . BC dog . I ll tell you what , you walk in on Sunday one of those bad priests and nail up there . It s going to change your opinion about the church . Holy shit . God , wow . I m wearing a tie next week . Because it comes down to my father and says , step up or step aside . The one thing the church hasn t done is step up and deal with the problem or step aside and let the authorities do it . And if they did , if they just did it and got serious and all of us knew that the second someone laid a hand on a kid wrong neck I was gone . You know what would happen ? Church would be full of the raptors again . You know what else would happen ? Pious men of God would show up to be priests and get great men . They would like coming off them . So you went on on Sunday . There would be a great man of God in front of you . </s> <s> We re those old school guys . Good morning , everyone . Happy Sunday . How are you feeling today ? Well , first of all , I d like to thank the Terrelli brothers for taking down the life sized Jesus and nailing up Father Fieningan here . I know . I know . Shut up ! Quit your scream . It was good enough for Jesus . It s good enough for you . Now , today we re going to learn about retribution . Oh , and we re going to sing some songs . I want you to think of it as a crucifixion karaoke . Shut up ! Take it like a man ! Oh , I m sorry , Gregory . I know that s what he said to you . Don t cry . Oh , don t be on me and me on church . Okay . I m handling the darntie . And Gregory , why did you choose from your eyes ? Come on , do what Jesus would do . Cowboy up . Now , first of all , I d like all the little children this bastard mess with to please step forward . All of you , whole cheese and crackers . Okay ? Well , I hope Satan loves ripping the flesh from your bones and feeding it to the whorehounds of hell , you maggot ! And that reminds me . Don t forget about the big sale on Wednesday . Now , I d like all the children to please farm a single fire line because well , I ve only brought one nail gun . I wasn t expecting the overflow . And Gregory , you re first . Come here , let him through . Let him through . There you go , boy . Come here . The trigger s right here . What ? Of course , you can shoot him wherever you like . No , don t you be upset . This is just you nailing him . Come on . Now , if I have anger , or offended anybody with that piece of material , all you have to do is give me the pro raping little kid side of the argument . That s what I thought . And by the way , if you re in here tonight , thank you . Thank you . That was great . Did you guys like , you guys like , hold up , hold up . No lightning bolt . All right , we clap a little bit . Now , his ass is in a burning ember on stage . Clap a little bit , all right . And by the way , if you re in here tonight and you re really high up in the church , I m whitey . And we re still waiting for our apology . I got to tell you , you know what , in the last 20 years in this country , I believe we have pushed out of society . You guys remember your fathers and grandfathers ? They ve taken the crap we ve been taking last 10 years ? Hell no . If I d have got messed with the church and my father found out about it , papers would have read a lot different . </s> <s> It wouldn t have said priest deed counseling . It might have said massacre in church . Because my father had a lot of things to do with it . And he said , you know what ? You know what ? You know what ? You know , you need counseling . It might have said massacre in church . Because my father had a on off switch . That s all he had . Shhh . BOOM ! I m in . I m a light of candle for you before I go . Clap . Clap . Clap . Remember those guys ? We need to be those guys . My father was insane . My father invented road rage . Wasn t the first guy to get mad in the car . But he was the first guy to get mad enough to make the paper . Oh yeah . This happened when I was six years old . There was a time before car sheets . When if you were a little kid and you got in a car accident , you just bounced around the interior until you hooked a door handle . My father picked me up from school . My dad had six , four , three piece suits sales . We re driving home and this kidness and polish just mess when I m trying to run him off the road , flipping him off , screaming out of him . And my father handled it pretty well . I knew he started to get pissed though because he put down his beard . And he pulls over these railroad tracks and he stops . And the kid screeches up behind him , he s flipping him off yelling at him . And I m now standing on the passenger sheet looking out the back window because I know there s going to be a show . And my father didn t say word . Just get out of the car , walk back to the kid and the impala who is dumb enough to leave his window down . Not my father s fault . And he s still swearing at my dad who s six , four , looming over him . And I can see what the kid s saying because I could lip read swear words when I was a fetus because of my father . But the kid only gets half the word out . And he goes , mother ! And my dad goes , wham ! And I m six . Here s what I saw . Here s the kid s dashboard . All I saw was mother ! And he never came back up , man . It was just an abandoned vehicle . It s his toy . And my father didn t say word . He just kind of checked his work . Got back in the car when sit your ass down ! And we went and got ice cream . That s right . Remember those guys ? Here is the most sentimental of my father , guys . Because he s not a big on sentiment . My father had a bunch of heart attacks . I think he was going for the record . And that just for the heart attack , he sat me down and said , look . I ve had four heart attacks . My body can probably only take three more . </s> <s> So when I go , there s some things I want you to handle . Because I m a man now , right ? No . Because I don t tell you now . He ll screw it up when I m dead . I want to be buried in a cardboard box . What shut up ? Or I ll flick this in your other eye . Cardboard box . When I take the box , I want you to put it in front of the audience at the funeral . Hold up , dad . Did you just call it the audience ? Are you going to charge a cover ? What do you think we could get ? Hey , ladies get in free . Now , once you leave the litter of the box open , I want you to let everybody . Why , pissed off in my life , step up and take a piss ride on me . What kind of music do you want with that , dad ? Blue eyes crying in the rain by Willie Nelson . Okay , dad , let me get this straight so I don t screw it up . Well , we re at your funeral and it s ladies night . What , your friends , are you remaining on your corpse ? You want me to play a song with the word Rain actually in the title ? Now you re getting it , numb nuts . Now I have to do a funeral . I ll bury next to Grandpa Shut Up . I don t want to be buried next to a dead people , especially my father . I want to be cremated . Then I want you to take the ashes . I want you to put them in a douche bottle , find a hooker and run me through one more time . On my children , I did not write that . I am repeating it . And it s one of those things when you hear it , you go , oh ! Disgusting yet whimsical . We had New Year s dinner with him a couple years ago . And at this point , my dad s life , my dad , has had six heart attacks . At dinner , orders himself a 24 ounce prime rip . And I m a grown man , I couldn t even talk . I went , mother , are you , what the , what the , can t , you know what , you didn t , you didn t , ah , ah ! You fuck , ah , ah ! And he looks on wife and he goes , California public schools , can you translate ? And by the way , if he goes first , I m going to be all over you . Dad , what ? My doctorate s HMO said I could eat as much fat and crap as I want it , makes my heart work harder , makes it stronger . </s> <s> Oh , that logic , dad , let s put some cheese on it . And after dessert , I will punch you in the aorta . So the show is going to like , bought myself a gift . I bought myself a Dodge Viper . Cool car except we were going to the snow , yeah . So you can t take a Viper in a snow , only had to learn that one time . Ha , ha , ha , ha . So I said , dad , why don t you take the Viper for a couple weeks and enjoy it , send it back to LA when you re done . So I also make sure you put a 450 horsepower vehicle in the hands of a terminal heart patient . I m a retard . So we have to the camera , the camera for four days . I m morning and fourth day seven AM , I get a phone call and this is verbatim . How I hear my father pass , pick the phone guy goes , Mr . Titus , Newark Police Department , your dad s dead . Kind of harsh , isn t it ? And I know a lot of comedians and it sounded so weird the way he said it . I went , okay , fucker , who is it ? So it s Newark Police Department , your dad s dead , don t call me fucker . And although we ve been expecting it for a long time , you are never ready for something like this . And my brain kind of snapped and I went into denial and I said , poked him . And there s this really long pause . And the cops says , excuse me ? And I said , poked him , he could be dickin with you . And there s a much longer pause . Sir , we ve poked him , he s not dickin with us . And then I said something that sounded so wrong and I did not mean it in the way it sounded . And I said , is the viper okay ? Because I thought I d give him the death car , I thought he flew off a cliff or wrapped around a tree . I thought it was my fault , but the cop didn t hear that part of it . He goes , sir , your car is fine . Again , it s your dad , that s dad . Shall I poke the car , sir ? So I gathered everybody at my head down the mountain . I have to admit this , I had mixed emotions . Although my dad and I fought his whole life the last five years of his life , we were best friends . I was sad . I was also really pissed because he knew damn well I couldn t get the deposit back on the ski con or I rented for the week . </s> <s> It was like his final F you to me . Well , your dad s got a terminal heart problem when you re going to no skin . Not for long . So I show up at the house , a whole family s here and I m the oldest kid . I got to plan the funeral . So I go down to the funeral home , but I take my brother and my sister . My sister Shannon s here , my brother Dates here . And I m sitting in front of the funeral home and the eye guy s office and they have , they have so much money , man . The guy s , I m sitting in front of 8 , 000 in my hog and he deaths . The guy s got a 3 , 000 through 85 haircut . Perfect funeral guy and he goes , Mr . Tidin . We are so sorry for your loss . Did your father have any specific wishes on how he wanted to be there ? And I look at my sister and before I can say a word she goes , you tell him . And the man knows I have a TV show so I show him the most expensive caskets they make . He showed me I m not making this up a 17 , 000 platinum caskets with a DVD player in it . Yeah , it s in the viewing lid . There s one of those headrest screens you can slide a DVD and play a tribute video to the person actually in the caskets . And I like to think this is my god , man , my family s going to so fight over that DVD player . I said , no , that s nice . But my dad didn t want to be buried in something metal or wood . Did you have something corrugated ? Pardon me sir , cardboard ear . Excuse me , cardboard . My father said he wanted to be buried in a cardboard box . And the man had obviously never heard this sentence before , man , because his face went into like epileptic seizure . Frankly , it looked like he tasted butt , man , Xeo . And my brother Dave tried to help him . But then he goes , hey , hey , not like a refrigerator box , something nice . And my sister lose it . He loved cardboard . And he ever tell somebody something . You ever tell somebody something they didn t want to hear ? So they decide that you didn t say it . He just pushes the expensive caskets because I take out the Walmart cask and most of the time , I m going , no , no , no . He gets down to the cheapest caskets , which is basically a slack crate with Home Depot burned in the side of it . And I got pissed and said , rock ! My father said he wanted to be buried in a cardboard box . Then we ll talk about the cover charge . And he slams the fucking ego , fine . I can give you a rental casket . </s> <s> To which my brother Dave says , who brought it back ? Which is a genius question , by the way . But the guy gets the butt tasting look on his face again . And he goes , no , we have caskets for situations like these looking at me like cheapest bastard in the world . At the end of the casket opens up , we take your father , put him in a cardboard line or slide him in and close the end on him . So my dad s in this huge , pes dispenser . Great . And we had the funeral . And my dad s best friend Bob said to me , tightest , that was the best , oh , worst funeral I ve ever been to . Because number one , standing normally packed to the walls . We made about 2 , 000 on the door . And everyone got up and told an honest story about my dad . Not some BS , this was the greatest man ever . Here s one of the stories . He used to go houseboating every year . And the only way to do is drink all day with a bunch of firemen , but my dad hung out with firemen because he smoked in bed . Then we get hammered , sleep on top of the houseboat or night , and during nights of the ping in the boat , you know , that head they would just pee off the top into the lake . Well , one night my dad gets up eight times , hammered steps on everybody , pees off the boat like eight times . And they get the next morning looking when I have him peeing . All night my father had been peeing off the top of the houseboat into the driver s seat of his homeboat . That s a beautiful story and that s beautiful . And there was ten stories like that . And so here s the funeral , hysterical after weeping , hysterical after weeping . And it was beautiful and offensive and perfect . And I believe illegal . And then it was over and everybody went home and it was just me and my dad . So I peed on him . But now I m freaked out because I got to find a hooker , you know ? And if I m asking the normal stuff , it s already going to be weird , but now I m getting out of the car in an alley . So I got the whole family getting out behind me . Everybody s crying , I ve got an urn and a douche bottle . Lola is it ? Yeah , we want something a little freaky . And I couldn t go through it . I called my brother and said we had a no douche meeting . I said I m not doing this . So we came with a compromise because he s still on my father , right ? And that s what we did . We took half his ashes , spread him at various Victoria s Seeker dressing rooms around the country . The rest of his ashes went to Caesar s palace in Lake Tahoe , Nevada , because my dad was a huge gambler . </s> <s> He s one of those dads had a little quarter jug . He d fill him with quarters at the top . And we got to the top . He d take his little jug to the casino , you know ? And then he d take like 10 grand out of the bank . And casinos have a lot of rules . One of the rules is not to not spread your father s ashes amongst the casino patrons . So my brother , my sister and I walk in the Caesar s palace , 7 p . m . Saturday evening , pockets full of day . And I walk to the back of the casino where he goes all the way across . And I start walking down . I start flipping out my father s . Oh , amazing , great house . We do sound ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding , ding . And I get to the end of the aisle thinking nobody saw him cool . I look back . I m leaving a contrale of smoke behind me , like I m a jeep going across the Calahari Desert , man . And the whole casino is kind of looking at me . And I have a TV show on the air at the time . Was that Titus ? Is he on fire ? What distracts them is my sister Shannon , who s way crazier than me . He takes a handful of my father walks to a packed and blackjack table and goes , magic dust . And now , because this cloud kind of hanging and the pitfalls start walking over , I m just stuck to the carpet , man . I don t know what to do , man . I m frozen . I m freaking out . I m at , this is the weirdest thing I ve ever been involved in . And I ve been involved in some pretty weird shit , man . And I couldn t move . I thought I was having a stroke , my heart was pounding and all sound went away . And I swear to you , the only thing I could hear is my father hysterically laughing . And I knew he was there , because of the cloud settled , and parts of him dropped into people s drinks . He gave me a sign , because Adela was right in front of me , put a blackjack in a whole table lost . Oh my God , he s here right now . That s what happened to him every time . That s why I went to community college . Worst part of him had died in two weeks before he died . My wife told him she was pregnant with our daughter . Yeah . Nice timing , numb nuts . Dad , what did you say my whole life , huh ? You better not have a kid , you re a retard . You probably kill it . Moon and feed the dog when you were seven . That s gonna happen to your kid . You re gonna need grandpa around to raise that kid , turn that kid into an adult , isn t that right ? </s> <s> And what happened , huh ? What else you stuff up my ass my whole life ? Step up or step aside , right ? Step up or step aside , and what happened , huh ? World s coming apart , I got two little kids and you re not here . You stepped aside . That means I got a step up . Oh . Funny . Okay smart ass . Come here grandpa wants me to tell you something . Come here little one . Listen , look I m just your dad okay . I m not a superhero . I can t even climb Buckingham Palace . And I can t stop some idiot from crashing an airplane into a building of bone up a bus . I can only be your dad and give you a few pure truths . Number one , duct tape will save your life . Number two , two puck is a lot . But I need you to keep that on the DL because it s a shug . And number three , and this is the most important one , don t be afraid of anything , except for the television news because they re lying to you every night . And don t be afraid of failure . Be like your father . I don t fail , I succeeded finding what doesn t work . And middle one , don t be afraid the world s going to come to an end . It can t because you re here now . And I promise I m going to get up every day and on the fight to make sure you have as many birthdays as you re supposed to have . But I m going to need you to get up and fight with me okay ? Okay daddy , it s all . Thank you people , you guys were great . Thank you so much guys . Thank you my amma . Oh you guys are good . Thank you guys . Thanks for listening . We haven t heard a long time . Thank you guys . Thank you guys . Thank you . I ll see you again . Thanks . </s>"

        "transcript": "<s> Thank you . So the rule is everybody , the rule is if you screw up just one too many job interviews , you become a stand up comedian . That s how it happened to me anyway . I could never make it through a job interview . You know it s such a high pressure situation . You really need that job . You get all dressed up . You get in there a couple of minutes early . You re trying really hard not to make any stupid mistakes . First opportunity to make a stupid mistake . You make a stupid mistake . And they give you that application and you accidentally write your name in the wrong boss . You already didn t get the job . Alright , what are you going to do ? Scramble it out . Hand in your application with a huge scribble mark . And the very first blank at the top of the page . Here you go ! Say you like you have the job ? No . No , you didn t . Can t ask for another application either . Could I have another application please ? Why ? Because I can t believe the wrong boss . You re going to be like you don t need another application , sir . Because we re not hiring any idiots . You put your name in the wrong box of a job application . You have no other option . But to leave your name in the wrong box . And you re in the interview . You guys like to see your name is Ben Bailey . Yes , yes this . And you currently reside at 365 Ben Bailey for the moment . Yes . Why I ve lived there all month . But don t try to send me mail at that address . I put my mailing address in the comments box . And due to a bizarre zoning coincidence , my zip code is exactly the same as the first five digits of my phone number . But don t try to call me at that number . I put my calling phone number in the comments box . Just below my mailing address for your convenience . And yes , before you ask , my mother s maiden name is Caucasian . But despite all of those seemingly bizarre things still feel that I am quite clearly the right man for this job . So my name is Ben Bailey everyone and I am indeed the cash cab guy . Thank you very much . I am the cash cab guy . I ll tell you how I know that . Everyone that I saw today told me . Everyone over and over and over again all afternoon . They run right up and shout it in my face as though they are certain that I am wandering around wondering who the heck I am . I hit their like there he is . And I don t think he knows . Better get over there and tell him right away . Get up nice and close . Make it loud and clear . I m sure he hears you . Don t waste a man s time . They do they run right up and go , you re the cash cab guy . I am like I know . I would have not know that about me . Why are we shouting ? </s> <s> We are three inches away from each other . I can taste your gum . And it s delicious . You break off a small piece for me . And then I grab them and hold them until they begin to squirm . And then I set them free and they run off . As I figure that way , they have a good story . I met the cash cab guy yesterday . He took the gum right out of my mouth . And then he held me . It was awkward to say the very least . But I will never forget it . I guess that s what happens when you have a TV show . People that you don t know come up to you all day long and say the exact same thing over and over and over . I m not complaining . It s just an interesting thing to deal with . People say the same stuff a lot . I get this one a lot . Oh my God . You re a lot bigger than you look on TV . I always like , well , you know , I mean , how big is your television , lady ? All right . Let s see . Have a nine foot TV at your house . I m probably going to be a little bit larger here in reality . Isn t everything a little bit larger here in reality ? These buildings must be freaking you out right now . Look at them . Look at them . You know , at your house , they re only like this big , right ? Here in reality , you can go inside them . It s truly remarkable . People say that one a lot . You re a lot bigger than you look on TV . They say it s so often that I am considering hiring a dwarf whom I will dress up to look exactly like myself and make him walk a little bit ahead of me at all times . You will run up to him and go , you the gas can t die ! And he ll be like , I know ! And then they will be like , you are exactly the same soddens . That s what I m telling you . That s when I ll come out with . . . I ll throw the dwarfs . . . Why not ? I m paying him . I m kidding . I m not going to pay him . So people do say the same stuff a lot . They ask me the same questions a lot . They go , hey , did you have to get a real taxi license to host that show ? And I say yes because I did . And then they always make the same joke . They think it s brilliant . They go , well , at least you got something to fall back on ! And I am like , that is absolutely hilarious . I often sit and chuckle at the thought of losing my television show and becoming a regular cab driver . </s> <s> That is the funniest scenario that I can even come up with right now . When you imagine the disappointment I would feel if the show were to be cancelled and I were forced to drive a cab for real to make my living , my disappointment would be tremendous . But it would pale and compare to the disappointment felt by those individuals that got into my taxi . Because I would not tell them that the show had been cancelled . Until the very end of the game . I just make the questions up as we went along . They d be right no matter what they said . Way to cancer , this is amazing ! So few people know that Wisconsin is the capital of Texas . Right , it d be all fun and games till we got where they were going . We just went to 1 , 500 in the cash game ! No , you didn t . You know , it was cancelled two years ago . You won nothing at all . In fact , you owe me 14 and 86 . Disappointed ? What s going on ? I used to have a TV show . Because I would turn into a bitter douchebag if that ever happened to me . There are no two ways about it . So I m a little bit of a weird mood . I got some bad news the other day . I found out that I am allergic to people who are lactose intolerant . It s a bizarre condition . I m lactose intolerant . I just can t tolerate those people . Always farting and complaining . I can t have milk . Fine , then don t have milk . Why do I have to be a part of it ? Why can t you just eat and drink the things that you know you should leave me out of it entirely ? Why do I have to be involved in this ? And there was like , how can you be so mean ? And right when my restless leg syndrome is acting up . . . You heard about that one , restless leg syndrome . Come on , what kind of horse shit is that ? It s a syndrome , restless leg syndrome . I have no idea what constitutes a syndrome . It s a hell of a lot more serious than some freaking wiggly legs . I ll tell you that one . You re just freaking it out . Oh my god . You can see what just happened to me . Just pouring into emergency rooms . My legs are wiggling . Doctors like that s actually good . If the legs wiggle , they stop wiggling , that s a problem . Come and see me then . No , you ll need help . It s a leg syndrome . Pharmaceutical companies are just making up things to sell us cures for . Alright , don t let your legs wiggle , give them this blue pill . Well , what if they ask questions ? Well , I don t know . Show them a cartoon of a butterfly or something . Legs wiggle ? Eat this . Well , okay , but does it . . . Follow the butterfly . Take your medicine , stupid . So maybe they re real . They re just exaggerated , I think . </s> <s> You know , like , how many lactose and tolerant people do you think there are in Africa ? Not a single one . They will tolerate all the lactose that we can possibly get to them . We re just up to our necks and lactose here . Like , I can t tolerate all those lactose ! Can we send some of the shit to Africa , please ? They re in Africa like , we look back to the lactose . Yeah , they re Indians in Africa . There s a huge population of Indians in Africa right now . We ve gone there in search of lactose . I just rolled in , show us the milk . Don t bullshit me , I know it s you . The cash cab guy told us . Someone always gets offended at my lactose intolerance bit comes up after the shell . Hey ! I am lactose intolerant ! And I m always like , I know you re the one I was talking about . You re doing it again right now ! You know what else has been pissing me off lately ? Google ? You guys know Google ? A couple of people have heard of it . First you guys are like , Google ? What s Google ? Google it and find out . I m not the only one who learn anything anymore , it s the Google it . And that was fine at first because things were simple . It was like , Google was my friend , right ? I d be like , hey Google , what do you know about this ? And Google would be like , well Ben , here s what I ve got for you . Things were simple then . Google was my friend . But somewhere along the line things changed and Google turned into that annoying friend . We ll never let you finish a story because it keeps interrupting you trying to guess the ending before you can get to it . Right now I sit down and I type the letter P and Google is like , Pacific Ocean ? Is it Pacific Ocean ? Is it the passive fires , the packers , the peanuts , the piss bag ? What is it ? I didn t know what I did right now ! I can t wait anymore ! I m like , I m frozen that the keyboard is like . . . Can t we just slow this down a little bit , Google ? What are you in a hurry ? You re not even a real thing ! We have to be somewhere , Google ! You re everywhere ! Just give me a second and let me type this in right . It s not Pacific Ocean . Okay , now it is Pacific Ocean . Because I can t remember what it was when I started . So thanks a lot , Google . Now I have to learn about giant sea kelp for two hours . You can t keep your big Google mouth shut . And who the hell typed Pissbag into my Google anyway ? I m like , who is researching Pissbag at my house on my machine without my knowledge or consent ? And what information are they after ? </s> <s> Right , if you can spell Pissbag , you know everything about Pissbag ! It s a Pissbag , a bag for Piss , a Pissbag ! That s it ! There is no more ! Even all mighty Google can t give you extra information about Pissbag . Would you like information on where to purchase Pissbag ? No , Google , I wouldn t . . . I would like you to go back to just being my friend . Google , now I used to be friends . Now Google thinks it s better than me . It thinks it knows what I want better than I do . Right , I sit down , I type something in . Google is like , okay . But did you mean this ? Hey , screw you , Google ! Yes . Yes , I did mean that . But I think we both know that now . So why don t you just give me what you obviously know ? I m after . . . Instead of jerking me around , showing me half a million websites that made the same stupid typo I just made . Right , we both know at this point Google that I m not researching the city of Philadelphia . So why don t you just give me what you know I m after ? Quit jerking me around because I don t type that well . You re the one that rushed me to begin with . I ended up learning about stuff that I m not interested in because Google is so suggested . I typed in Take Flight . Three hours later I m an accidental ornithologist . I ve been inadvertently studied birds for the better part of an afternoon . Now I m googling binoculars . I m planning a family bird watching trip . I was trying to book a flight to Cleveland . Thanks a lot , Google . What am I supposed to do with all this bird knowledge ? Did you know there s a classification of birds called nearly flightless birds ? I think that is pretty damn funny all by itself . Right , nearly flightless birds . Think about it . These are birds that almost can t fly . Right , they can fly but just barely . They can fly around at all they want but the whole time they re up there . They re like , whoa ! Oh my god , oh my god , oh my god ! We should not be up here . We are like this closer now being able to do this . Nearly flightless birds who s making that stuff up ? We ll call these birds nearly flightless birds . Why ? Why not ? Good point . So that s what we get . Nearly flightless birds . What are the other ones ? Completely flightless birds ? They re just sitting on the beach . Like this is bullshit . Why are we even birds ? All we can do is waddle around and bitch about how we can t fly . The sucks . Make me a ronant . Call me what I am . I don t want to be a bird if I can t fly . </s> <s> Right , completely flightless . Nearly flightless . Nearly flightful has got to be the next one up . I think that s probably the worst one of all . Right , these are birds that almost can fly . Right , they cannot fly . But they re close . And they don t know how that they will never succeed . So they ll spend their whole life just running and jumping . This is gonna be the one ! Woo ! Some of a bitch ! Why must we be nearly flightful ? I d rather be completely flightless . It s the same thing . Without the false hope . Right , then of course there s completely flightful birds all the way at the top . Just a bunch of elitist bird assholes . I think they re better than everyone else flying around with that too . Like , woo ! Looking down at all the other birds . Like , oh , most nearly flightful . Almost , buddy . Why don t you carry that for me ? I always wonder if other animals are jealous of birds ? Not because birds can fly , but because we build houses for them . You know what I mean ? Like a squirrel must look at a bird house and just be thinking , you have got to be kidding me ! Really humans ? Really ? They can already fly . They have a huge advantage over everyone else in the animal kingdom . And yet you are going to provide them with free houses . Thanks a lot . I m a squirrel . I have all these nuts ! No where to keep them . You re going to build a 20 room hotel on a stick for the goddamn birds . Where do you think my nuts are going to be in the morning ? There s a question every man should ask himself . 40 leaves the house tonight . Give yourself a long hard looking mirror . What do you think my nuts are going to be in the morning ? Well , the whole goes well . They ll be right where they are now . And a little bit lighter . It looks like finally a sex joke . All these birds , birds , birds , birds . You guys have learned enough about birds . You re tired of being lectured about nature . I had a weird thing on the way in . You ever have one of those awkward little moments with someone that you don t know ? Those are some of my favorite things in the world . You ever do this one ? You ever end the conversation with a stranger a little bit too early ? And then realize that you re going to be walking the same direction . That they are . So now you re walking with them . But you ve already said goodbye . Neither one of you is certain of you re supposed to continue the conversation or not . It happened to me the other day . This guy asked me for directions . I said , yeah , go eat , blocks up , make a left . </s> <s> Go to over and make a right . And then go three more up and you ll be there . And he was like , all right , thanks buddy . And I was like , no problem , dude . And then we walked away right exactly next to each other . At the same speed , three blocks into it . I was like , it s someone going to say something else . Or do I have to kill this man ? Five blocks in . I just couldn t take it anymore . So I stopped and waved him ahead . Go ahead , you beat me . I can t take this shit anymore . Go on , walk . But as he started to pull away from me , I started to worry that he might get lost . So I yelled up to him . I said , hey , if you get confused , I ll be right here behind you . And I don t think that comforted him . So much as it frightened him . Because he started walking a little bit faster . And without even realizing it , I started walking a little bit faster . Now I m chasing this man . He breaks into a run . That pissed me off . So I went , go ahead , run , buddy . I know where you re going . I purchased a house recently , not a bird house , a human house . I lived in Manhattan for like 10 years in tiny little apartments because I was broke . And then I moved out and bought a house out in the middle of nowhere . I got all these extra rooms now that I m not used to . Fancy rooms like a laundry room . Pretty high for looping . A separate room just for the laundering of items . Right next to that , the guest bathroom . I can t even go in there . It s for guests . So after a while , I said , hell with this . I don t want to see what s going on in there . So I cut a big hole in the wall of the laundry room . It goes right into the medicine cabinet . And the guest bathroom . And when guests come over , I just put my face in the hole . And I wait for them . Now sometimes it s over quickly . Other times it seems to take hours . But it s always worth it in the end . Sooner or later , that little door creaks open . And I go , my dear old god damnit ! And the guests , they just shit right in their pants . I know because they tell me . They say , I just shit right in my pants . And then I usually say , you know what ? I actually have some pills for that . If I could just get around my ear and get them . . . Take two of these . Stay out of my cabinet ! You will shit yourself less . And then I slam the door . Yeah , I put a little handle on the inside . Just for that part . All right , that last part wasn t true . I don t have a house . I don t have a house . I live in a yellow mini bang . </s> <s> And there s life in this healing . We re the same song plays over and over and over again ! Bam ! I m gonna drive that thing right into the river one day . Wait , I only have some good contestants . Where are we going so fast , man ? It s a new part of the show ! It s called a Hudson River Challenge ! All right , here s how the Hudson River Challenge works . I m gonna drive the cab as fast as I can . The end of the house and street and smash through the barricade , through the river . You ll have approximately 12 seconds to escape . Or you will die . And your shoutouts are both gone . That would make the newspapers crash cab . How do they come up with those brilliant bylaws ? I would do that , and I could do it . Hello , discovered channel executives . Just kidding . Maybe . I did buy a house , bought a house out in the woods after 10 years of living in Manhattan . I didn t go into the woods for 10 years . Now , if you haven t been in the woods in a while either , I would like to warn you now . There are animals in there . Lots of them . Shit loads . All different kinds . Cute ones , frightening ones . Annoying ones . One night I couldn t get to sleep , because there was an owl outside my window . Yeah , an owl . And at first I thought it was kind of cool . I was like , hey , this is kind of cool . There s an owl outside my window . An hour later I was like , son of a bitch . There is still an owl outside my window . I can see 50 other trees from here . What is so damn special about this one ? And it wouldn t have been that bad , except that the owl seemed to somehow know when I was almost asleep . He d be quiet for eight whole minutes in a row . As soon as my eyes shut for a second , it was like , hmm . Somebody say who ? How does he know ? We went on for a long time , but we went on for so long that I started to wake up , even if he didn t do it . Right ? Because I d be like , why the hell did he do it ? Ow ! Are we still playing ? Okay . Finally , I got so irritated that I got up out of bed and closed the window . Which is funny , you know , because I could have done that right at the beginning , instead of waiting three and a half hours . But I couldn t , you know why ? Because my bed was perfect comfy . You know what I mean ? The perfect comfy bed . You can t tell where your ass ends and the sheets begin . </s> <s> Just a blob with a head sticking out like , aww ! Oh , I love you right now , Ben . You are so perfect . Don t ever change . You can hold a piss for 12 hours in a perfect comfy bed . Are you bladder is screaming ? Like , have I made it clear ? How urgent the situation is ! You re like , you do what you need to do in bladder . Well , I never watched a set of sheets before . That s how comfy the bed was . That s how annoying the owl was . He got me out of a perfect comfy bed . I slammed that window , I raced back and tried to get back to the bed before all the perfect comfy had escaped . I can never retain full perfect comfy . It s 20 to 25 percent at best . I must begin rebuilding from there . But you know that already . So there I was trying to rebuild my perfect comfy bed when I came to the horrifying realization that I could still hear that owl . Even with the window shut . I swear he moved a little closer . Put his little beak right to the glass . Who ? Who ? And I knew right in that moment that I must change my strategy in dealing with this bird . I knew I must wait until he fell asleep . So that I could mess with him in the same way that he had been messing with me . So I waited for a really long time . Turns out owls are nocturnal . Which is something you would think I of all people . You would probably have known . Alex Trebek knew that , didn t he ? But not me . Luckily for me the same thing is true for stand up comedians . We too live at night . So I waited that little bird bastard out . Sure enough , as soon as the sun started to come up over the mountain , this giant owl eyes began to shut . And I waited for just the right moment . And then I went , me ! Me knows he s freaking out . That s who , me ! Having trouble sleeping body ! And I think it pissed him off . I do , I think it got into his head . Which is really his whole body . Because he put down his lally pop . After just two legs . He came down out of the tree and closed the window . And then we both went to sleep . Now I thought about killing that owl . I m not gonna lie to you , I pondered bird murder . The wee hours of the morning . I wondered if I would have to pay a fine . Where that owl to turn up dead on his back on my patio . And with a steak knife in his chest . I had to chalk out line around his body . A lally pop in an evidence baggy . </s> <s> Seemingly untouched . The least questioning me . Is this your steak knife , Mr . Bailey ? I ve never seen it before in my life . Perhaps the bird was unhappy . I would have killed that owl , don t think I wouldn t have . I ve killed birds before . It wouldn t be the first time . I ve killed two birds in my life . And I did it with one stone . Now I know it sounds impressive . But please wait for the facts . There were two very small birds . Both trapped in one very small cage . I was standing over them with a huge stone . Conducting an investigation into the realism of expression . My friend holding the video camera . People have been bragging about this bullshit for hundreds of years . Today we find out just how difficult it actually is . Well there you have it folks . Hundreds of years of trash talk . And it s just that easy to kill two birds with one stone . We ll be back right after this with have your cake and eat it too . Every now and again and beaten half to death . Turns out it s pretty damn easy to kill two birds with one stone . Depending of course upon what kind of birds they are . Birds were say ostriches or emus . Both of which are nearly flightless by the way . If the birds were ostriches that would change the whole equation . Then the question would lie and how many times you re allowed to use the same stone over again . Hey are you the guy who killed two ostriches with one stone ? Yes I am . It took me seven hours . But I did it . The first one was easy . He just walked right over to me . I think he thought I was going to feed him or something . He just leaned his big stupid ostrich head in and bam ! Took him out with one shot . That spooked the other one . Took off into the jungle . Or wherever ostriches live . I ran in there after him . We were in there all day . Twice I thought I had lost that stone . In which case I d be completely screwed . I d have to start all over again . Where do you draw that one ? Hey are you the guy who killed eleven ostriches with nine stones ? I m just some bizarre crew knelt . It s killing a lot of rare birds in a pretty freaking violent manner . I had something to prove when it all started . Now I m just getting arrested and escorted out of the zoo . You thought I went to Africa ? Perfectly good ostriches in the Bronx . Or there used to be . Spreshing still make any sense . How about this one ? How d you sleep ? Like a baby . Would you shit in your shorts ? Would you wake up crying every half an hour ? </s> <s> That else ran with you . You re 45 years old . You re just hop sleeping and that crib . This ruining your social life . How about this one ? How often you ve been getting over there ? Oh every now and again . What ? How often is that ? How often is that ? Every now and again . Think about it every now . And again , every now , all the nows . Every single one now , now , now , now , now . And again , that s freaking impossible . You cannot go somewhere that often . You go somewhere every now and again you are trapped there for eternity . And again . Doesn t make any sense . How about this one ? We re never trying to get two good things going on in your life at the same time . One of them keeps faltering . There s always someone there to whisper these words of wisdom . Well , you know what they say . You can t have your cake and eat it too . Hey , fuck you . Come on . You try to mess with my head . Right , if I can t eat my cake , I don t even want it . What else am I going to do with it ? You just sit there looking at it , I have cake . Well , don t eat it . Then you won t have it anymore . Shit , that s the whole reason I got it to begin with . Would you like to have some cake ? No , thank you . I ll eat mine . You have yours . I might eat yours when I m done with mine and then you won t have yours either . You cannot have your cake and let Ben eat it too . Who the hell has cake and doesn t eat it ? Diners . You can t eat the cake in a diner , I ve tried . Did I have a piece of that enormous chocolate cake , please ? No . We don t eat our cakes here . We rotate them . Fair enough . One of my favorite ones I heard was here in New York . I had seen a big fan of it . I was going to eat it . I was going to eat it . I heard it was here in New York . I had seen a big fight on the street . One guy was all beat up playing on the ground . The other guy was gone . There s an old woman standing over the guy in a panic saying the exact same thing over and over and over . He beat him half to death . He beat him half to death . Over and over . Half to death . And after a while , all I could hear was half to death . And then just half . Half repeating in my head . I started thinking half . How could she possibly know that ? So I interrupted her . I said , excuse me . </s> <s> But there is no way that you could know that this man has been beaten half to death . The only way that we could know that for sure is if we were to beat him half to death . If we were to beat him again . Exactly the same way . And he were to die right at the end . And she agreed . So we beat the crap off . Me and the old lady . Recreating the first beating as best we could . Sure enough right at the end . He died . That s when the police arrived . And they said , what has happened here ? This man is exactly dead . And we said he s been beaten half to death . Twice . So I know I seem like a nice fella on the cash cab program . But that s editing . No , I am a nice guy . I try to be a nice guy in the show . I think what I m trying to say is that road rage is real . Anyone who s driven 100 feet in a major city knows that road rage is a reality . There s a line on one side of the line . You re like that man is driving aggressively and I wish he would stop it . On the other side of that line that turns into I will kill your old family . If you do not move your city vehicle from my path immediately . You will be the one who loves cars who are the world s primary cash . Right . They re right next to each other . If you cross over into that second one there is no quick route back . You need to pull over for a minute and cool off . You come a danger to yourself and those around you . Road rage is real . And I am no different . Well , I m a little different in that I am hosting a game show when it s happening to me . So the camera is always on me . Right . So I can never show anything . I just can t go . Yeah . Yeah . Great name to be sent in traffic for 12 hours . Right . No matter what happens I don t show it . So it builds up and builds up . And then it comes out when I m not ready . On several occasions I have thrown the cash cab into park and left into traffic . Full intention of kicking the shit out of a complete and total stranger . I m not proud of it . All right . I m a little bit proud of it . On one particular occasion we were sitting in traffic on 3rd Avenue for the 150th day in a row . We continue to choose 3rd Avenue despite the fact that they re building a hospital and a pipeline and a freaking amusement park in the middle of 3rd Avenue . And we are guaranteed at least 40 minutes of going absolutely nowhere . So I m already irritated by the traffic to make matters worse . There is an electrician in a van behind me who doesn t seem to understand how a traffic jam works . </s> <s> Right . He seems to be under the impression that somewhere all the way at the front of the traffic jam . There is a man in a very wide car who has just nodded off at the wheel . And that if he , the electrician , can only honk long and loud enough . He will wake the man in the wide car and will all be on our merry way immediately . To make matters even worse , the electrician and his horn have impeccable timing . There is good as the owl if not a little better . He will only honk if I have just begun speaking , which means I have to stop speaking and start all over again . So I m talking . I m like , located in downtown BAAAARGH ! What is this guy s problem ? Let s try that again . Located in downtown BAAARGH ! BITCH ! I try to sneak one in real quick before we could honk . I m like , located in downtown BAAARGH ! Now does he know ! And then that little fuse in my head short circuited . Now everything s different . Now there is no third avenue . There s no hospital or pipeline or amusement park . There s nothing . There s just me and the electrician . So I m like , I think I ll put my window down . I know another bird . This one is completely flightless . I wish the god I could fly off the end of my arm and punch that ass hole in the nose and fly right back . But it can t . So I just hold it up there long and steady . I m sure he sees it . Not only does this not stop the horn , but an already powerful horn seems to somehow be gaining strength from the finger gesture . Right before it was like , bird , now it s like BAAARGH ! Now I m like moving back and forth . Singing a crazy little song in my head . And then the horn stops and I m like , oh my god , it worked . As I m pulling my hand back in , I see in the mirror the electrician is now getting out of his van . He is walking toward the cash cab at a healthy clip . I don t think he s coming to say , hey , I really love your show . Right ? Is he s walking like this ? So I ve been in a situation like this at this point and stayed in the cab . Now if you ve never been in a road rage altercation situation , take it from me , seat it and buckle in with your face in a big hole and a perfect punching height . It s just no way to begin a street fight . You re like , really , you re just going to keep your face in a big opening like a boot at the county fair . </s> <s> I can just push the shit out of you over and over and over until you remember that you can close the window . So I ve been there before , it didn t end that way , but it could have . So I remember it and I see him coming and I m like , that s not happening again . I throw the cab into park and I come barreling out . Now I am the last dude that he was expecting to see , I m flying out of the driver s seat of a New York City taxi cab . Right ? He s expecting a much smaller Middle Eastern fella . Right , not six and a half foot me with my Marine Corps aircraft , 200 episodes of pent up the cash cab road rage . Pernie my eyes , I have . You know how many people could kick down without using their shoutouts buddy ? You know how many ? So he sees me coming and he immediately goes from , hey , to , hey , hey , hey . You large and frightening man , you . Why were you doing that silly thing that you didn t ? And I m screaming before my feet even hit the street . I m like , it s a goddamn traffic jam . Nobody s going anywhere . It doesn t matter what you do . So why are you all getting shot the fuck up ? Then he says he goes , you re crazy . Then I go , I know you and your horn made me this way . So deal with it . He goes , I m calling the cops . I m like , you got out to kick my ass and now you re calling the cops . And what he doesn t know is that while he was sitting right behind me , right behind him was the cash cab crew van . And there s eight dudes in there . One of them is a New York City police officer . He has a gun . His whole job description is protect Ben Bailey . So while I m arguing with this guy in the middle of third avenue , they are lining up right behind him . Like a team photo in a high school yearbook . There s like two rows of dudes with their arms folded . So he says I m calling the cops . So I m like , why don t you save yourself a little time and turn around and talk to the cop who s standing right behind you who works for me . And that just like sends him real and now he s like regressing to some driver instructional course . He just starts going , never get out of the van . Never get out of the van . Never get out of the van . Never get out of the van . Finally it gets up the nerve to turn around . I mean he s scared , right ? </s> <s> He s like , how could this bizarre cabbie have a police posse that is already behind me ? Like 11 seconds have gone by . This is insane . So we doesn t know what to do . But eventually it gets up the nerve to turn around . He slowly turns around . There they all are right behind him . Nobody says a word . He just kind of looks at them like , really ? And they all just kind of look back at him like , yeah . Yeah , but me . And that s enough for him . He dives back into his van . He slams the door and he locks it . Now I m standing in the middle of the third avenue , still staring at him . He won t look . He s staring at the passenger seat . Suddenly very interesting , the leather surface of that passenger seat . Tony , the cop slowly walks over to me . He gets right up next to me . He leans in real gloss and he goes , what the hell is wrong with you ? He gets even closer . He says , you re a game show host . And I swear to you , that s the first moment that I m going to be in the middle of the third avenue . I m going to be in the middle of the third avenue . And I swear to you , that s the first moment that it occurred to me that I am , in fact , a game show host . Nobody sees that one coming . It s also the moment that I remember that there is a couple . In the back seat of the cash cab , right in the middle of a game . So he turned and looked and they re like noses to the window like , ah , this is the best show I ve ever seen . So I don t know what to do , unlike humiliated , fired up . And my eye just slowly walked back over to the cab and opened the door . Climb in , sit down . All right , you guys have 600 . You have 23 blocks to go . You have two strikes . You ve used your mobile shout out . You ve used your mobile shout out , but you still have your street shout out . Don t forget about it . Here s your next question for 100 . But first , you guys have 600 and we are stuck in a red line and that trigger is a red line show . Thank you so much , everybody . Thanks for coming out . Thank you . You </s>"

Wow ! Holy shit ! You guys are cheering like it s the price is right , relax . It s a beautiful place . It s a type of place for a senator who will get assassinated in 1860s . It s a class . This is a host . Miller Lightcans lined up by the fucker . God bless it . Those that are working class people that I love . God damn it . Look to my left , I thought it was a bowling alley . How are you , fellas ? Good luck in the tournament . In toxic white Europe . It is no respect for white European males . I realized this . I was in Jersey last night working in Jersey . I had to get on the tarp pipe to come home . I had to go to the bathroom with the Jersey tarp pipe . So I pawned to a rest area . What s the name of the rest area ? The Vince Lombardi rest area . That s the best we can do for the greatest coach in the history of the NFL . Should we put a statue of him in front of his high school ? No , let s build an 18 by 24 brick structure . I have to exit 13A . We re truckers who have been living on hooker pussy and beach jerky for 14 hours . We can unload their impacted bowels . We can exchange filthy blow jobs at 3am . Where pedophiles can come into the faces of terrified children . You know , the shit that Vince Lombardi was for . Fucking Vince Lombardi rest . Where s the Jerry Sandesky rest area ? That s my question . That s the rest area I want to see . Life size , statue of Jerry in a bathing suit , half a heart on , big smile on his face . Couple of boy scouts and headlocks . Fucking white toxic males . How about Jesse Smullett ? Is that the feminine black toxic fucking feminine ? What a genius . You know why he did all that ? He said he wasn t getting paid enough . 65 , 000 dollars an episode . Well , it turns out after that hoax , they figured out in three seconds . You re a pretty shitty actor , I guess . Fucking . You know , that s not a white guy trying to pull that off . Fucking reverse hate crime . I d have to get two white bodybuilders from Sweden , put them in black face . Fucking beat me up , make it look like it was two black guys , leave a pack of new ports next to me . Jump , break , cool , laid over my head . And I d set it and they d go fuck you . This is Obama country . So I d set it in Salt Lake City , naturally . Make the fucking . . . What a scumbag . I hope he still has that fucking noose and he uses it the right way this time . Yeah . Just so you could onstage find a beam , you know what to do . </s> <s> Fuck it down . Some years will laugh and the rest he s like , it s he is shitting in your little faggy fucking liberal pants . I m woke , okay ? And I m on the right , motherfuckers . Yeah . Draw up here . I live in our Westchester and I draw up made here and I m like under two hours . I got a ticket last time . Fucking Nazis on the teconic . Can you get enough cops ? Doing 106 . You know . My buddy was with me . He goes , you re doing 106 . I m like , so would he go , we hit a deer with dead . Instead of deer at this speed if we hit a fucking moth . It s gonna go through like a hollow point bullety . You shit me , what are you ? So I use the ways app . I love to . . . Anybody use the way ? Of 20 of us , the rest of you is what ? Getting raped and Uber cars on the weekend . How many Uber rape stories have you read in the paper last year ? I ve read like three . You know , if you re an ugly girl , you can t get a date on a Saturday . I just call Uber , okay ? They ll be happy to take the assistous house , you know . Wake up in the driveway , you scurred over your head . What happened ? Am I there ? You ll send a like a Haitian on bath salts to pick you up . Go ahead , get that fucking . . . That would be 22 , 000 , but on your shoes . I love that way , zap . I fucking love it . You know , it tells you where the cops are and I still sell coke to school children in the afternoon , so that kind of works up . Do you know , come up with a way , zap ? The Israeli military . That s kind of ironic when you think about it because Jews are known best for what ? Being lost in the desert for 40 years . Sliding up ahead , Moses . What s this , a Palestinian crowd ? I ll let you send it with the fuck . I use the way , zap , to drive into New York City every night to work on my act and I live 40 miles outside of New York City .

He used to write a rottica from magazine in New York City . He wrote an article saying , when women are having sex with their husbands , they re secretly fantasizing about being raped by three guys at once . That s how he knows he s a real socialist . Even in his rape fantasy , he s sharing the pussy three ways . I want to redistribute pussy . It s trickling up to the 1 to get another pussy . Sex is big , but he hides it .

Trying to make some sort of small talk like , it just wants nice day , isn t it ? You know , nice boots . Dude , I got a mint , man . I m fascinated with Hitler , man . Just how the fuck that guy ever came in power . Because does he ever look like he s in a good mood in any of those clips ? Everyone just , ah , ah , I m fucking here slapping around . There was nobody even in the beginning to be like , dude , is it me ? This guy was , this guy s not crazy . He kind of a spaz . Total cock block . You can t even have him around women or nothing , you know ? You know what , it s crazy people can take over shit . That s what it is . Regular people , I don t know . You just never say shit . You ever notice that ? You can be on a bus . 30 decent people , one crazy dude can take over the whole bus . Right ? Every piece is sitting there , everything s great , then one crazy . Ah , I m fucking just such screaming . The second that happens , all 30 people are like , hey , hey , hey , hey . I think I have some , see , guys , have you tightest everything s freaking out ? It s like , why doesn t everybody just pounce on the doof ? I think every regular person should just have like a chloroform rag , like right in their front shirt pocket . And the second any crazy shit happens , if you re behind it , it s on you . You just pull it out and you take the guy down . Everybody jumps on and you tie him up . And you tap two possibly the next Hitler across the forehead . You keep an eye on it , right ? </s> <s> No , but it s so hard . It s just hard to speak up . That s the shit , you know ? Like I was gonna target the other day , right ? Not for Agon , you know ? Like what ? Now I m standing there with a buddy of mine , right ? He s a bouncer . He s a bouncer in this really like crazy bar , so he knows like all these scumbags . And it just so happens that one of them just so happens to come walking through the target . So my buddy goes to wave to him , like , hey , man , how s it going ? And riding this guy , he ll be like , ah , you know , it s going pretty good . He just launches into this tirade about like immigrants right in the middle of target . Is it cause of going ? Tell you how it s going . Scott Dan , Mexican s keep coming to this country . Take it all to fucking job . Immediately everybody in line like , ooh , M M , let s feed the back of these girl . Wow , look at that group host . Is he still there ? I m not looking . I looked the last time . It s very trying to look . I am not looking . You just look . This guy was going off . Nobody did shit . Clude me . Clude me . I wasn t looking at the guy . Even the people who worked the target . They just kept ringing stuff up . Like , ooh , three socks for a dollar . That s amazing . Think it s gonna rain out , fuck . Dude , it was a classic chloroform moment . This guy , he was doing like a fucking Hitler opened mic , you know ? He was just going off . He was learning how to put thoughts together , right ? How to speak in front of groups . Somebody should just came up , you know . Through some skittles on the ground , you take them out . That s it . It s over . But nobody did shit . You knew there was like one guy working at Target , like some crazy dude peeking out from the back . Like , I like this guy . This guy s making a lot of sense , right ? He follows him out to the parking lot . They jump in his El Camino . Now there s two of them , right ? I don t know . I m into conspiracy theory , man . That s my thing . You guys enter that shit . You read this stuff I do . I gave you fast food . Fast food , I think , is like a conspiracy . You know ? I think that s how they just keep us dumb . You can t even think after a while . </s> <s> You ever notice that shit ? Like , you ever notice that shit ? Like , you ever have any whole day planned out ? Eat one egg McMuffinies on the couch ? Yeah , you know what ? Fuck my dreams . That s the way you hit the wall . That is good , yeah ? That s a good thing . Dude , it s unbelievable . Healthy food . You can t even smell it . You have a bag of apples right in front of my face . Like , my eyes are closed . I can t smell it . 200 miles away . Oh , fuck . Is that KFC ? You know , I got some chicken . Well , there you get a fucking of it . I ll tell you , never notice that . You never notice that . You never notice whenever the government fucks up . All of a sudden , like McDonald s has like a new sandwich . You know ? You just sitting there screaming at your TV . How the hell did I get pardoned all these CEOs ? New Macrib ? I m gonna fucking turn it . Shut the fuck down your face . So anyways , yeah . So I have a lot of like , uh , I have a lot of fucked up thoughts , man . I do . This is the most recent one I had . You ever drive down the street and see like , 30 people up on a sidewalk and you just think , fuck . All right . You don t do it . You just think it . That s what separates the psychos from the functioning psychos , right ? Psychos , they just think it , fuck it . They do it . They get the wikers going . They make a day out of it , right ? But as a functioning psycho , not only do you not do it , you actually analyze it . Like , man , if I just leave my hand right here , nobody knows who I am . I move it two degrees over here . I m on the cover of Newsweek . I am instantly famous . Right here , nobody knows me . Just a regular jackass like , hey , Bill , you want to come to the cookout ? You know , maybe you could bring that potato salad with such a big head last year . One of the most terrific saints we ve seen in here . Bottles just screwed about . This is really dope there . And it s going to be there . You could strike up a conversation . Maybe hook up with there . Knowing the kids . I m going to be there . I m going to be there . I m going to be there . I m going to be there . Knowing the kids should even try to stop . No , I have those thoughts all the time . Like recently my girl took me to a street fair , right ? You guys are a minute of street fair , you know ? They close off the block . They close off the block . It s like , swammer . They re like , shit made out of buttons . </s> <s> Right ? People with no teeth have making key chains , you know ? It s a typical girlfriend idea . It sucks . And it s going to take all Saturday , right ? Right ? She s like , all excited . She s like swinging my arm . Oh , my God , this is getting stuck in pain , right ? I m like praying for lightning , some sort of scaffolding to fall down on my head , you know ? So she comes up . First place she comes up to is this is big table and nothing but homemade jewelry , right ? Homemade jewelry , okay ? It s got twigs in it , macaroni , it s shit . It is a table of shit , right ? But she loves it , right ? She s like , oh , my God , it s definitely so funky , right ? She s like trying on the earrings . Do you like these ? Do you think these are nice ? Right ? I want to be like , no ! If they were nice , they d be in a store , all right ? There d be a roof , some sort of structure would be built around this . This is shit . This is a table of shit , right ? Oh , cool . It s cool , right ? But I don t want to be a dick , so I m like , no , honey , that s great . You know what , I m going to go get some air , okay ? Even though we re outside , I think there s more air to be had , you know ? It s not because I felt it , I was going to snap . I literally watched like two , three tables away and this lady standing there with this big table and nothing but muffins , right ? Homemade muffins , it s like 85 degrees out . She s standing there with this big table , nothing but muffins . She s got this big stupid , look at the muffins I made , look at her face . And the second I saw that shit that part of my brain was just like , dude , what would happen if you just came up and just said , hey , lady , these are muffins ? Oh yeah , I m just starting to go and fucking , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Like , how many of these muffins could I mush before anybody did anything ? I mean realistically , I think I could have got the whole table because even if you saw me doing that shit , it would take at least five to six seconds to process like , did I say you could do that ? Is it like the game ? Do you eat the muffin up ? You re fit ? That just seems like a waste of pastry . You know , dude , there s no security of shit like that . There s no dude standing there . He s mushing the muffins . Okay , I ll put my money . So we re gonna have to ask you to leave and just choke me up . </s> <s> So I just started thinking of the horrified , fucked up looking this lady s face as I started slamming these muffins . And I didn t know where I just started laughing like a maniac . I m like slumped over this fried , pogo cart , I m dying . My girl looks at me . She s like , what the hell you laughing at ? And like an idiot , I actually tried to explain this fucked up looking her . Like she was gonna get it on some level , right ? I m just sitting there like , I was just thinking , if I started punching the muffins , you know what I mean ? I just started punching the . . . And she s just looking at me like , why do I go out with you ? Dude , but I swear to God , man , if I never broke eye contact a second I started hitting those things . That girl wouldn t even be able to cough , I help . I would have been in her head , it would have been too personal . She d be like , did I go to high school with this guy ? Why would you do that ? Muffins are a happy food , I don t understand . All right , listen , I m out of time . You guys are so much fun . Thank you so much for coming out . I really appreciate it . Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . </s>"

        "transcript": "<s> They call me a leader of the South . I m only one man . I m a friend . They re going to get curious . I got to throw those bars here . But you wish you that were the ladies and gentlemen . Please welcome Mr . Ron White . Thank you . Thanks , man . You know what I m going to do . I m going to start off this evening by asking you a question . Because I don t know the answer . I lost my sunglasses and yesterday I went to the sunglasses . Here s the question . Why does a pair of sunglasses cost more than a 25 year old ? A more than a 25 inch color television set . I go to the sunglasses hot . I see a pair of glasses . I like . I don t love them . I don t . I like them . 309 . And I asked the guy very politely . How do you sleep at night ? You little prick . What was it for ? And I told him it was true that two weeks ago I bought a 25 inch color television set from Walmart for 218 and he goes , well apparently sir , you don t get it . I m listening . He goes , these glasses eliminate 100 of all UV rays . Well , no , apparently you don t get it . This thing decodes a digital satellite signal that picks up from outer fucking space . And then it turned out the glasses got basic cable and I felt like a dickhead . Look , brain heart . Fight ! You ever take a crap so big your pants fit better ? Everybody ever do that ? I m hoping that happens to me later tonight because these babies don t fit anymore . I m hoping I m one big turd away from backing into an old wardrobe . Yesterday I was sitting in a bean bag chair naked eating Cheetos . I was flipping through the television and I saw Robert Tilton . He s a telephangelist from Dallas and he was staring at me . And he said this , he said , Are you lonely ? Yeah . He said , if you wasted half your life in bars pursuing sins of the flesh , this guy is good . He said , are you sitting in a bean bag chair naked eating Cheetos ? Yes , sir . He said , do you feel the urge to get up and send me a thousand dollars ? Clothes ! I thought he was talking about me there for a second . Apparently , I ain t the only cat on the block digs Cheetos . So it s great to be back in Kalamazoo at the state theater . Last time I was here , they took me to the Blues Festival , which I love the Blues , but they need to figure out some problems with the festival . I don t like to party anywhere . You can t just give somebody money and they give you back a beer . I mean , I started a live for an hour . My mouth is dry . I want a beer . I love beer . I know they re selling beer . People are walking away from the front of the line . They ve got beer . That s how I figured the whole thing out . </s> <s> I get up there . I give the guy my money goes , we don t take money here . What do you take ? Coopens . Coopens . Where do I get a Coopan ? You see that line over there ? Thanks forever . I stood in that line for an hour . I got to show them a driver s license , birth certificate , fill out a form . They mailed that away . Send me back some Coopens . What are you doing , Ron ? I m waiting on UPS , there s a good chance I ll have a beer by Thursday . I m partyin like a Kennedy right now . I was a game , two , I had a hundred bucks cash on me , about a hundred bucks worth of Coopens . And then some guys that took me there asked me if I wanted to go to a topless club and I didn t want to go . I just ended up going because you guys backed me up on this . You ve seen one woman naked . You want to see the rest of them naked . You re being hold back or check , you know they re gonna hang down to her . You wanna see my 10 easy ? Yeah , I do . Alright , that s enough . Rollin back up . Things to make you go ? And then closing time came around and the tabs came out and I found out the kitty bar don t accept them Coopens . I got a taco belt , don t we to kiss here s that ? I ll give you 40 worth of Coopens for a burrito with cheese . It s all I ve got . It s a Coopens . So I saw something that comes close to truth and advertising that the Beers people are almost saying what they really mean because the old the Beers slogan was diamonds are forever . Then they changed it to this year . Take her breath away . The new slogan is diamonds . Render her speechless . Why don t they just go ahead and say it . Diamonds . That ll shatter up . For a minute . So man , I was just in Miami . I don t know , it was a couple years ago . I guess just would not be the word but working there with Fox when Hurricane George hit the keys . I just thought this was kind of funny . They evacuated the keys . And everybody left except for I ve been through two hurricanes . I was in Hurricane Carla when I was a kid in Houston . And I was really excited during hurricane time . Because it s out there on the Gulf and it s dangerous . And I was like , this is cool . Those shit started hitting our house . But anyway , they evacuated the keys and everybody leaves except for one guy who s going to stay there and tie himself to a tree on the beach to prove a point . And the point was he said that at 53 years of age he was in good enough physical condition to withstand the wind and the rain from a force three hurricane . </s> <s> All right . Let me explain something to you . It isn t that the wind is blowing . It s what the wind is blowing . If you get hit with a Volvo , it doesn t really matter how many sit ups you did that morning . If you have a yield sign in your spleen , jogging don t come into play . I can run 25 miles without stopping . You re bleeding . Shit . Man , last time I was here I had somebody broken into my truck and told my radio , thank you whoever you were . Got to grab back the Texas list and the sound of wind for 49 hours . I went to the insurance company , I was throwing out these forms and I got to the part on the form where it says what kind of radio was it . I told the guy I didn t remember . He said , Mr . White , if you can remember what kind of radio it was , we ll know how much money to give you . I was in a good news right there . I thought of a real expensive sounding brand and I wrote it down and he knew I was lying . Mr . White , I don t believe Rolex makes a radio . It was a clock radio . I have to check premium boy . They love it when you call him premium boy . Next time you see your agent call him premium boy . He ll get a chuckle . I almost died this year . Actually I didn t almost die . I was near Miss Blaine crash . I was flying from Flagstaff , Arizona to Phoenix , Arizona because my manager had done a globe . We re on a plane that big . It s like a pack of gum with eight people in it . And what happened was we took off from the Flagstaff airport , hair care , and tire center there . We re traveling at half the speed of smell . We got passed by a kite . There was a goose behind us in the pile . It was screaming , go around . We get halfway to Phoenix . We got to go back . It s a nine minute flight . Can t pull it off with this equipment . We had engine trouble . We lost some oil pressure in one of the engines and they told us about it over the speaker system of the plane . We lost some oil pressure . Hergen . She s dead . It was weird everybody on the plane was nervous but I d been drinking since lunch . Take it down . I don t give a shit . Do you ever have one of those days ? Hit something hard . I don t want to limp away from this piece of shit . The guy sitting next to me is losing his mind . Apparently he had a lot to live for . He goes , hey man . If one of these engines fails , how far will the other one take us ? </s> <s> I m going to pull away to the scene of the crash . Which is pretty handy because that s where we re headed . I bet we beat the paramedics there by half hour . We re hauling ass . I ve got a really good job . It s important to have a good vocabulary . Actually I haven t always had a good vocabulary . When I was young , if I had known the difference between anecdote and anecdote , my friend Bob Schneider would still be alive today . He got bit by a copperhead . I m reading him humorous stories that a reader s died just . I ll tell you a little bit about myself . I m from Texas . I m a cowboy , a real cowboy . I was a broker ider for six years of my life and it s affected me . Now when I have sex , my arm goes like this . Seems to be some dispute between the wife and I , whether or not I m staying on that full eight seconds . So we got the timer and buzzer and set it up right there in the bedroom . I taught her the meaning of the phrase most of the time . It would have been all the time but she won t let me tie that rope around her waist anymore . She hates it when I spur out of the shoots . Hey you laugh , it s not easy to keep an erection with a clown and a barrel and a corn in the room . Here s a sir . You got to focus . I m probably not a typical Texan in that I don t hunt , I fish but I don t hunt . Not because I think it might somehow be more holy to eat meat . It s been bludgeoned to death by somebody else . It s really early in the morning . It s really cold outside . My cousin Ray on the other hand , things killing a deer with a deer rifle is magic in the forest . I d like to do for you now my impression of my cousin Ray after the big kill . Well it was four in the morning . 22 degrees outside . Or if you weren t there . Pussy . I made a camouflage deer blind with grease paint on my face . I ve got deer urine on my boots . I m not sure why . I made that part up . I got a 30 out six with a 12 power scope and a bullet that ll travel 2 , 200 feet per second . When that deer looked up to lick the salt sucker at home from the dangle tree , caught him right above the eye . Well I hit one with a van . Going 55 miles an hour with the hand lights on and the horn blowing . That s an elusive little creature . The bullet is moving too fast . </s> <s> So the bullet down to 55 miles an hour and put some headlights on a little horn on it , the deer will actually jump in front of the bullet . So I m a married man happily married man . Thank you very much for asking . I married a rich woman if you ever have a choice . Actually the wash is not rich at all . Her parents are no . And they hate my . And I m waiting for them to die . And you ll know if they die too because you ll never see my fat ass again . I ll be in Palm Beach with my new friends . And me a beer , Teddy . Servants rich , my endlaws have servants . I thought when I married their daughter they d send a servant along with us to help do all the shit they never taught her how to do . And I was wrong . We re now leaning on her domestic skills and who she s handy . I came up and doing a show the other night and she goes , honey , the dryers broken . Why did you check the Lent filter sweetheart ? Sit out , honey , I ll check it . I opened it up . Is there anything in there ? There s a quilt in there . Look , you made a sofa cushion . I hear a lot of this . I hear a lot of ron , you re pretty good sized old boy . And I guess a little woman s a good cook . Oh , I got a little better when she figured out that smoke alarm s not a timer . And the teller , honey , the food is done before that particular buzzer goes off . It was real bad when we first got married . The first meal she cooked in our new house , I couldn t eat it . I gave it to my dog . He started licking his butt . She comes into kitchen and says , what s he doing ? Looks like he s trying to get the taste out of his mouth . Everything s an emergency to my wife because she never had to deal with her own problems . Spoil , cater to her whole life . There s no cure for that . I was at Atlanta one time . She calls me one night . Mrs . Me and the hotel room , they catch me in the lobby . And tell me I have an emergency phone call from home . I knock over 10 people in the lobby of a very nice hotel thinking maybe my in laws . I call her . She tells me my dog s sluggo just took a dump on the new carpet . Shoot him . She goes , that s just like you , Ron . I have a genuine problem . And you re being sarcastic . All right , honey , I m sorry . Put the dog on the phone . I ll talk to him . What do you want me to do ? I m in your job . I can t pick up the turd . Put a paper towel over and I ll be home in a week , honey . I get home , it looks like a little campground in the living room . </s> <s> Somebody s having a poopa paluza concert . Light him outside . He ll shit out there . I ve seen him doing . We have a beautiful son . His name is Marshall . I named him after an amplifier . Almost named him P . V . Come here , blah punk , a little woofer . My son s five years old . My son thinks five years old is a very cool age to be because that s the coolest age he s gotten to . His favorite thing about being five years old is he s old enough to wear a seat belt . That s his biggest visible step towards man who it s so far in his eyes . He s strapped in the truck just like his daddy . And he thinks that s great . I think it s great too because I drive a four wheel drive truck . And I learned this about four wheel drive trucks . It doesn t really matter how big the motor is or how big the tires are . And your macho days are over when you strap a car seat in the front of that bad boy . You just can t show it off to your buddies . You know what I mean ? You can t make yourself go , what ? That s got the Vortec V8 running 285 horsepower . Yeah ! That s a man at the walk power winch . That ll pull 28 tons right out of the ditch . Yeah ! That s a play school car seat . With the Big Bird steering wheel attachment wrapped around it . That s bird on the blanket or any on the windshield wiper . That s Big Bird in the middle . You can haunt that fat bastard if you want to . LM2 weeks I ll have the Cookie Monster flip mirror . Backorder to don t me . I don t know how I drive the truck anymore . I bought this big two story custom van to tour in . And it s got the James Bond couch in the back where you push your button . And the couch in the back automatically turns into a bed . And I m like , well that s cool . I finally got something over those Mercedes Benz driving in . You know what I mean ? When I first bought the van I was real proud of it . I took it straight over to my brother in law s house to show it off because he s such a prick . He takes one look at my new van and goes , I can t believe you didn t buy a Mercedes Benz . They don t make a van . They hate it when you do that . It was raw I don t think you fully understand the intricacies of Mercedes Benz engineering . Why I ve got the three inch windshield wiper that keeps my head like clean and arranged all . I got a place to fuck your sister . I don t know why they don t like me . But you wish you had one of these . It s a kid . </s> <s> Kidding . I don t want to screw up good whiskey . I just wanted to do those three jokes before I told you . I ll tell you what went wrong . I feel like I can be honest with you folks and you won t judge me or maybe you will . It s very difficult to marry out of your class . I come from a lower middle class family . My daddy worked his ass off his whole life for not very much . That does not make you better than me . Right . And they re always going to just look down their nose . You re supposed to be carrying some piss bucket for them or something . If you re not willing to carry the piss bucket it ain t going to work . She got convinced in her crazy head that I had sex with this girl in Columbus . How ? When you enter into a monogamous relationship with somebody , usually do it at a point in the relationship when you re having a lot of sex . So you re willing to sign the papers . I only have sex with you ever , ever , ever , ever . Well if that person stops having sex altogether , why you find yourself in quite a pickle . I m a pretty good dog but if you don t pet me ever once in a while , it s hard to keep me under the porch . I m not as flexible as a real dog . But I ll tell you what happened too . I was in Columbus , Ohio . I haven t been laden three months , three months . You can t go three months without having sex with me . I ll go have sex with somebody else . I know . I ve seen me do it . I did a show one night . I came off stage as a gorgeous woman , maybe 35 , 40 years old , long black dress , slid up to her waist , gorgeous . Give me a second . And I walk off stage because I thought you were hilarious . I want to buy you a drink . I m like , I can t do that . I m married . Because I didn t ask you to want to have sex with a big boy . I asked you to have a drink at my place . I m like , alright . You know that little guy that sits on your shoulder that reminds you of your prior commitments and your moral fortitude . And you re a peep out of that . He hadn t been laden three months either . He was speechless for like 20 minutes and he was like , suck your kitty . I was gunna . I m having a three way with my conscience . As soon as all things over , he s back at his post . That was wrong , mister . Like , hey , 20 minutes ago , you were beating off on my shoulder , monkey boy . I hate him . He smokes pot . He burned a hole in my other jacket . I m spending a ton of time in Los Angeles . I learned things when I go to LA . I learned this . </s> <s> They have bikinis now made out of seashells . I didn t know that . And I also didn t know this . If you re ever walking down the beach and you see a girl dressed in a bikini made out of seashells and you pick her up and hold her to your ear . You can hear her scream . Who the fuck it ? I thought I d hear the ocean but not over that woman . Push , man . She was a wiggler . LA changes people . I got a buddy of mine from Houston . He s comedian . He moved to LA six months ago . Six months in LA . Don t know him . He s a vegetarian . You know , great . If you re here tonight and you re a vegetarian , shut up . You re not going to recruit me . I did not climb to the top of the food chain to eat carrots . It s not even that good for you . Ever see a healthy looking vegetarian ? They look like shit . They re all plump and great because their body s become intolerant . I m on the way to the Melrose improv in Hollywood to do a set with my buddy . He says this and I quote . I feel nauseous and I have a headache . I think that vegetable soup I had for lunch must have had beef broth in it . I didn t know what to say . Your system s kicking back broth ? You re a manly man , aren t you ? Where are you a vegetarian ? I asked him and it wasn t even because me was bad for you . He said that raising cattle was bad for the planet with cow flatulence in the ozone and the clearing of land for the raising of cattle . What are you doing to help the environment ? I m eating the cows . But I m only one man . Whenever the hell that meant . Every time I read a newspaper in Los Angeles , California , I get pissed . Because things don t have to make sense in LA . I read an article in paper in LA that said they re going to try to outlaw the big screen real life handgun shooting video games because they say that s what s wrong with the youth of America today . The learned had accurately shoot guns with video games . It s not a parenting problem . Oh , fucking hell . It s a video problem . Then I piss you off when you have a genuine problem . You try to attack a solution too . It s got nothing to do with the problem . You know what I mean ? I came up with a great idea . Don t outlaw those machines . Give them to the state troopers of California because they re some of the worst shots I ve ever seen in my life . </s> <s> I saw a shootout once live on TV that went on for so long , eventually the criminal got frustrated and shot himself . And the cops were on TV whining about it going , he s got on body armor , he s got on body armor . I m watching a live on CNN going , I m seeing his head shoot him into fucking head . Give my kid a shot . Wow , how s that , daddy ? Good shot . Pooch . Everybody relax . Pooch took him out . Thank God Pooch was there with his considerable skills . Horrible shot . Some cops are . You ever see tape with the keyhole brothers from Ohio , those guys that get out of that white suburban , they showing off cops ? These guys folks have a shootout with the police at point , black , range . Nobody gets hurt . I would love to have been at the office the next day when that guy s being interviewed by the chief . And then what happened ? Well , at that point I loaded my semi automatic 9 millimeter weapon at point , blank range . And then what happened ? They left . Nice shootin Elmer Fud . There was a kid in Detroit three years ago shot eight bullets hit nine people . These two cops shot 22 bullets , didn t even hit the fucking suburban . Give those guys a roll of quarters , drop them off at the mall . That s all I m sayin . You know what I mean ? It s just not like Texas , you know . The biggest difference between Texas and California and Texas , we have the death penalty and we use it . That s right , if you come to Texas and kill somebody , we will kill you back . That s our policy . We re trying to send a message to the rest of America and the message is go somewhere else and kill people . Go to California , they don t give a shit . I was watching a case on court TV when I was out there . I got so mad steam was shooting out of my ears . This guy s convicted of a triple homicide . This guy kills a grandmother , a mother , and a granddaughter without provocation . And a crime so heinous , I can t even fit it in my head . He sentenced to death by a jury of his peers and right before it comes time to carry out the sentence , a group of people on his behalf , on his behalf , stand up and they go , we can t kill him , he s too crazy to know we re killing him . And what the hell are we arguing about ? If you don t know the difference and it makes me feel better , how do you know he s crazy ? That s what I want to know . Of course he s crazy . Kill three people . This is what they said . He rolls his turds into little balls and eats crayons . I m like shit , you gotta quit putting all crazy people in one group , God damn it . </s> <s> You gotta separate them up a little bit . What does that crazy person do ? Oh , he rolls his turds into little balls and eats crayons . Fine , I ll feed him for the rest of his life . What does that crazy person do ? Oh , he kills productive members of our society . Well , he should ve rolled his shit into little balls and ate crayons . Because the penalty is much less severe . We re trying to pass the bill right now through the Texas legislature that will speed up the process of execution in heinous crime , and more than three credible eyewitnesses . And more than three people saw you do what you did . You don t sit on death row for 15 years , Jack . You go straight to the front of the line . Other states are . . . Other states are trying to abolish the death penalty . My state s putting in an express lane . I did that bit out in California and this guy comes up to me after the show . And you can tell he was nervous to talk to me and he goes , You know what ? That may be true about texting the death penalty , but you know what ? What ? It s be waited for me to say , what ? That s kind of cute . There s an old law in Texas that states it in Texas . You cannot shoot somebody in the back no matter what they did to you or your family or your place of business . It s illegal for you to intern , shoot them in the back . Yeah , but you can start shooting them in the legs until they turn around . Because eventually they re going to get curious . Who shoot me in the leg ? I wonder quietly to myself . Oh , that guy never turned around . I was talking to my buddy and my other day , my friend , he s a homophobic . That s the most useless thing you can possibly be . I was talking to him the other day and he goes , He was me and this was going to be better for me to queers . And I m like , you know what ? The next time you have a thought , let it go . I m like , we re all gay . It s just a what extent of you gay . He goes , that s bullshit , man . I ain t got it all . I m like , yeah , you are and I can prove it . He goes , fine , prove it . He goes , yeah , I love porn . You know that . Like , oh , do you only watch scenes with two women together ? He goes , no , I watch a man and a woman making love . Oh , do you like the guy that have a small half flasded penis ? </s> <s> There s no , I like big hard prop and cop . I did not know that about myself . I promise Sears I would tell this story on stage every night until the lawsuit settled . I had my van down to Savannah , Georgia . I didn t like the way the tires were wearing on it . I took the van to Sears Automotive , a trusted name and automotive service . Takes up three and a half hours to change four tires . Apparently they had to whittle one up out of a piece of wheat . I pay him 980 of my hard earned money . I take a ride , he and turn out of the mall . The left rear wheel falls off . It falls off . It falls the fuck off . Turn my van into a tripod . Spitting me into a dimension of pissed off . I ve never been in before in my life . This guy was a tired guy . That s all he did . He didn t some days work on transmissions . He was a tired guy . Sears I found out later and sent him to Tire College for three days . Apparently he was sick on lug nut day . But they still let him work on my van . I m suing him . I hope that next year they have to change the name of Sears Tower in Chicago to Ron White s Big Old God Damn Billon . You guys can all come over in party too . I m going to have a lot of room . I think we ought to clean up Ron . Hell no , Mayor do another floor . We ll call him up there . Somebody grab my butt . Bring your coupons . I got thrown out of a bar in New York City . Now when I say I got thrown out of a bar , I don t mean somebody asked me to leave . We walked to the door together and I said bye everybody . I got to go . Six bouncers hurled me out of a nightclub like I was a Frisbee . Those big old bouncers that go home every night watch Road House and beat off . Patrick Twayce is hitting another guy . For where in a hat I walk into a bar with a hat on this guy . Real pissy . I m like what s the deal ? I think what the deal is . Faggots in this area where Hatch trying to keep him out of a club . I m like oh really the only way we could tell down South is if they have their hair cut like your . And he got off the pitch . But he walked away and I took the hat off and like an hour later I ve been drinking and I forgot . You ever forget happened to me . I put the hat back on the guy comes over to me now . I m between 6166 depending on which convenience store I m leaving . </s> <s> I weigh 235 pounds . This guy comes over to me poking me in the shoulder with two fingers and says you re out of here . Oh wow thanks for scooting . And I was wrong . They hurled my ass . And then they squared off with me in the parking lot and I backed down from the fight because I don t know how many of them would have taken to whip my ass . But I knew how many they were going to use . So handy little piece of information to have right there . Overkill . But it called the police because we broke a chair on the way out the door and I refused to pay for it . The cops showed up and at that point I had the right to remain silent . But it didn t have the ability . The cops said Mr . White you were being charged with drunk in public . I was like hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey . I was drunk in a bar . They threw me into public . I don t want to be drunk in public . I want to be drunk in a goddamn bar . Which is perfectly legal arrest them . Well they didn t arrest them instead . They call in for my arrest record . There s some good news . Sad lights are leaking up in outer space . Computer banks at NASA kicking on . There s a telegraph in Fritz Texas going , beep , beep , beep , beep . This part takes awhile . Barrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr . Short hand . Now I told you that story to tell you this story . When I was 17 years old , I was arrested for being drunk in public . It seemed to be a pattern . If you knew Morris Code , you would already know that . And one DWI , which was a bogus charge because it turns out they were stopping every vehicle and down that particular sidewalk . And that s profiling . I believe in the drunken public charge in French , the arresting officer , who I have literally known all my life . You know what I mean ? This guy only have four doors down for me in a town of less than 400 people . Weath men . He takes me to jail when we get there . He asked me if I have any aliases . And I was just being a smart ass and said , yeah , they call me Tater Sally . 17 years later in New York City , I m handcuffed on a bench with blood coming out of my nose . This cop goes , are you wrong ? Tater Sally ? You caught me . You caught the Tater . You can take down those roadblocks now . I call my son Tater Tot . And Poot . I am a dog lover . Actually , I love my dog and I ll give a shit about your dog . </s> <s> I don t know your dog , man . Your dog could be an asshole . Slug goes an English bulldog . Slug go , don t jack with me . You know what I do when he s asleep ? I lift up those big , huge bulldog jowls and I hide him and him and shit in there . He wakes up in the morning and he s like , it s gonna be a good day , Tater . He calls me Tater . He s a great dog . He s sick right now . He s debating the buck . If he gets sick , he can t just feed him , he ll spit it out . He got to hide it and a piece of cheese . I started him out last year for picking the litter and I put him with a female dog for a couple of weeks and then to make sure it took , I took him down to the Benton area in his office and that artificial insemination done twice . Now for those of you that don t know , that s where they obtained the seam in from Sluggo and put it in the female dog and now it don t take shit to get old Sluggo to go to the vet . He loves the place . I went down there in the Benton area and had the audacity to say to me , Mr . White , if you ll just come on back here , what s your you had to do this ? Next time you don t have to bring in the dog , you can just bring in the seam and I m like , that s okay . You go ahead and jack off the dog . He follows me around too much as it is . Like I m gonna spread the rest of my life with his bone up . Get me off ! Get out of here , we got company . You did it the other day . New edgers , I don t have any thugs . I don t have any gun that thugs . I ll jack me up a piece of shit . Do we talk to daddy that way ? Please ? Please get me off the piece of shit and I ll have everything got there . I m gonna floss my mind , damn it . I ll tell you a little bit more about the demise of my relationship . There was that one thing where I had sex with that girl , but that wasn t the underlying problem . The big problem was the first problem was this . We lived in a house and it had a thermostat . I like the temperature of the house between 70 and 75 and she likes the temperature of the house between 75 and 100 and 10 . And you can t keep tater salad at that temperature . We fought about it , she was psycho , psycho women love me . </s> <s> We have an argument one night about the temperature of a dwelling . She goes outside with a butcher knife and cuts the tires on my truck . So I drug up an old polaroid and entered her in hustler s beaver hunt . And she won . And I used the money to get me some new tires . And she super glued my dick to my stomach . Do you see how things just get out of hand ? Still itches . But after three years of being married to this woman , I still didn t understand her . She would get mad at me when I was trying to help her . I ll give you an example . Let s say she d wake up in the morning and be real bitchy . Let s just say . And I knew in my heart she was suffering from PMS and out of my love . I would offer her my dog . And tell her , honey , I believe you eat this my dog . You won t bitch quite so much . She would growl at me and wouldn t eat the my dog . I had to hide it in a piece of cheese . Thanks for playing along . I hope you enjoyed it . You know how good , man . Thank you very much . Cheers . My night is over . And I m going to go to the bar . But the bar is in my pocket . So I don t have to go too far . That s a beautiful song . So how d you like to show ? It was awesome . It was very funny . Awesome . Oh , I loved it . I think it s hilarious . Ron White kills me . Yeah , I got Tater Salah . Don t get to me , man . I couldn t stop laughing . Tater Salah , we love it . We love it . He s too funny . My job s hurt and I think I was crying more than anything . You enjoyed the show ? Yes . Did you laugh ? Yes , I did . Did you pee ? No , he s not only funny . He is a cutie pie in a nice butt . My side still hurts . It s so funny . The bed of us in Laus is just hilarious . It s hilarious . Guy from Texas . That s like a sick , I m waiting to happen . I think I m going to start drinking scotch . We re just going to see the blue collar tour . At a house . Tater came right into your living room . That s not what I was talking about . He was on a bean bag with Cheetos too . Not bad . </s>"
